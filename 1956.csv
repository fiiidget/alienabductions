1956,'1956, Driver Describes 'Big Flying Saucer' Over South Dakota  The Bismarck Tribune; Friday, November 16, 1956. REDFIELD, S.D. -- A young truck driver who said he 'never held any stock in flying saucer stories' told Wednesday of seeing a huge object in the sky that changed colors and moved with tremendous speed.   Others, including three newspapermen, also reported seeing the object at great distance.   Marlen Hewitt, driver for a dairy here, told this story of wacthing the object as he drove a tank truck from Pelican Rapids, Minn., to Redfield:   'It was about 1:15 when I first spotted it as I drove along. At first I thought it was a star, I\'ve never seen a star that bright. There were other stars out at the time, and only a few high clouds in the sky.   'As I went on down the road toward Graceville, it changed colors a couple of times. Near Graceville, it changed colors four times.   'I thought my eyes were playing tricks with me. I stopped, turned off the lights and got out of the truck to stretch my legs. As I rounded the back of the truck, this thing swooped down about a half mile to the east of me and stopped about 1,000 feet up.   'I was very frightened -- I was terrified.   'If it had been on the ground, it would have covered about a square block. It looked to be about 12 feet thick. It was a slate gray color, and from the distance looked like it was metal. It was round, and at the base was an opening about 1/10th the size of the object from which a very brilliant light was shining.   'It would tilt around and back and forth, gaining maybe 3,000 or 4,000 feet in the flick of any eye.   'Around the edge of this thing was a lighted outline. I couldn\'t tell if there were windows in the lighted part or if there was exhaust coming out all around it.   'It would change colors from a blue-white to orange to red. I wanted to get out of there, so I jumped back into the truck and turned on the lights.   'When my lights went on, the thing turned a bright cherry red and shot up into the high clouds. It moved faster than anything I ever saw.   'As I drove toward Ortonville, it dropped down and went to the southwest at a tremendous rate of speed. Then it stopped and hovered.   'I could still see the light in the cloud when I got to Ortonville, and some editors who were going hunting came out of an eating place and watched it with me.   'After I got to Big Stone City, it came down out of the clouds again, further away but still changing colors.'   Hewitt said the object disappeared about five hours after he had first spotted the bright light in the sky. He had traveled about 150 miles in the meantime.   He said the roads were 'very deserted' at the time and that as far as he knew the only others to see the object were those at Ortonville.   Hewitt said the object mde no noise. He added there was a little wind at the time the object was at its lowest level and it seemed to move into and away from the wind with equal speed.   Among the hunters who saw the object at Ortonville were three newspapermen, Lem Kaercher of the Ortonville Independent and Don and Dick Olson of the Marshall Messenger.   published by NICAP, Copyright 1964 By Michael GoodspeedThunderbolts.info10-31-4www.rense.com', '1956: UFO Encounter / Jet Chase Over Bentwaters AFB, U. K.Because of the major importance of the 1980 UFO landings in Rendlesham Forest near the RAF / USA joint bases of Bentwaters and Woodbridge, another important, well documented UFO sighting at Bentwaters is often overlooked.Observations of unidentified objects by USAF and RAF personnel, extending over 5 hours, and involving ground-radar, airborne-radar, ground visual and airborne-visual sightings of high-speed unconventionally maneuvering objects in the vicinity of two RAF stations at night make this case a true 'unexplained.'. It is Case 2 in the Condon Report and is there conceded to be unexplained. On the night of August 13-14, 1956, radar operators at two military bases in the east of England repeatedly tracked single and multiple objects which displayed high speed, as well as rapid changes of speed and direction. Two jet interceptors were sent up, and were able to see and track them in a brief series of maneuvers. According to official U.S. Air Force reports, the sightings could not be explained by radar malfunction or by unusual weather.It began at 9:30 p.m. when Airman 2nd Class John Vaccare, of the U.S. Air Force at RAF Bentwaters, tracked one UFO on his Ground Controlled Approach radar (type AN/MPN-11A) as it flew 40-50 miles (65 to 80 km.) in 30 seconds, i.e. 4,800 to 6,000 mph (7,500 to 9,500 km./hr.). A few minutes later Vaccare reported to T/Sergeant L. Whenry that a group of 12 to 15 unidentified targets was tracked from 8 miles (13 km.) southwest of Bentwaters to 40 miles (65 km.) northeast, at which time they 'appeared to converge into one very large object, according to the size of the blip on the radar scope, which seemed to be several times larger than a B-36 aircraft [the largest operational bomber in history, with a wingspan of 230 feet or 70 m..' The single large blip stopped twice for several minutes while being tracked, before flying off the scope. At 10 p.m., a single unidentified target was tracked from Bentwaters as it covered 55 miles (90 km.) in just 16 seconds. This works out to over 12,000 mph (19,000 km./hr.). Then, at 10:55 p.m., the Bentwaters GCA radar picked up an unidentified target on the same east-to-west course as the previous one, at an apparent speed of '2,000 to 4,000 mph' (3,200 to 6,400 km./hr.). Someone in the Bentwaters control tower reported seeing 'a bright light passing over the field from east to west at about 4,000 feet [1,200 m..' At about the same time, the pilot of a C-47 twin-engine military transport plane over Bentwaters said, 'a bright light streaked under my aircraft travelling east to west at terrific speed.' All three reports coincided. Soon after, radars at Bentwaters and RAF Lakenheath reported a stationary object 20-25 miles (32-40 km.) southwest of the latter base. It suddenly began moving north at 400 to 600 mph (650 to 1,000 km./hr.), but 'there was no build-up to this speed - it was constant from the second it started to move until it stopped.' It made several abrupt changes of direction without appearing to slow for its turns. Around 11:30 p.m., the RAF launched a deHavilland Venom jet interceptor, from RAF Waterbeach. According to the U.S. Air Force UFO report: 'Pilot advised he had a bright white light in sight and would investigate. At 13 miles [20 km. west he reported loss of target and white light. Lakenheath (radar) vectored him to a target 10 miles [16 km. east of Lakenheath and pilot advised (that) target was on his radar and was \'locking on.\' Pilot then reported he had lost target on his radar.'Lakenheath GCA reports that as the Venom passed the target on radar, the target began a tail chase of the friendly fighter. Radar requested pilot acknowledge this chase. Pilot acknowledged and stated he would try to circle and get behind the target. Pilot advised he was unable to \'shake\' the target off his tail and requested assistance.'One additional Venom was scrambled from RAF station. Original pilot stated: \'Clearest target I have ever seen on radar.'The following conversation between the two Venom fighter pilots was heard by the Lakenheath watch supervisor: 'Did you see anything?' [Pilot #2 'I saw something, but I\'ll be damned if I know what it was.' [Pilot #1 'What happened?' [Pilot #2 'He - or it - got behind me and I did everything I could to get behind him and I couldn\'t. It\'s the damndest thing I\'ve ever seen.' [Pilot #1 The 1969 report by the Air Force-funded study at the University of Colorado under Dr. Edward U. Condon concluded: 'In summary, this is the most puzzling and unusual case in the radar-visual files. The apparent rational, intelligent behavior of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of this sighting. However, in view of the inevitable fallibility of witnesses, more conventional explanations of this report cannot be entirely ruled out.' USAF Air Intelligence Information Report filed by Captain Edward L. Holt, August 31, 1956. RAF CONTROLLER ACCOUNT:This is the little-known but definitive account by F.H.C. Wimbledon, RAF Fighter Controller on duty at RAF Neatishead, Norfolk: 'I was Chief Controller on duty at the main RAF Radar Station in East Anglia on the night in question. My duties were to monitor the radar picture and to scramble the Battle Flight, who were on duty 24 hours a day, to intercept any intruder of British airspace not positively identified in my sector of responsibility.' 'I remember Lakenheath USAF base telephoning to say there was some thing 'buzzing' their airfield circuit. I scrambled a Venom night fighter from the Battle Flight through Sector and my controller in the Interception Cabin took over control of it. The Interception Control team would consist of one Fighter Controller (an Officer), a Corporal, a tracker and a height reader. That is, four highly trained personnel in addition to myself could now clearly see the object on our radarscopes.' 'After being vectored onto the trail of the object by my Interception Controller, the pilot called out, 'Contact,' then a short time later, 'Judy,' which meant the Navigator had the target fairly and squarely on his own radar screen and needed no further help from the ground. He continued to close on the target but after a few seconds, and in the space of one or two sweeps of our scopes, the object appeared behind our fighter. Our pilot called out, 'Lost Contact, more help,' and he was told the target was now behind him and he was given fresh instructions.' 'I then scrambled a second Venom which was vectored toward the area but before it arrived on the scene the target had disappeared from our scopes and although we continued to keep a careful watch was not seen by us.' 'The fact remains that at least nine RAF ground personnel and two RAF aircrew were conscious of an object sufficiently 'solid' to give returns on radar. Naturally, all this was reported and a Senior Officer from the Air Ministry came down and interrogated us.'THE CONDON REPORT CASE:Lakenheath, England, 13-14 August 1956The Condon Report: 2230-0330 LST. Weather: generally clear until 0300 LST on the 14th. (For details see Section IV.) The probability that anomalous propagation of radar signals may have been involved in this case seems to be small. One or two details are suggestive of AP, particularly the reported disappearance of the first track as the UFO appeared to overfly the Bentwaters GCA radar. Against this must be weighed the Lakenheath controller\'s statement that there was 'little or no traffic or targets on scope,' which is not at all suggestive of AP conditions, and the behavior of the target near Lakenheath - apparently continuous and easily tracked. The 'tailing' of the RAF fighter, taken alone, seems to indicate a possible ghost image, but this does not jibe with the report that the UFO stopped following the fighter, as the latter was returning to its base, and went off in a different direction. The radar operators were apparently careful to calculate the speed of the UFO from distances and elapsed times, and the speeds were reported as consistent from run to run, between stationary episodes. This behavior would be somewhat consistent with reflections from moving atmospheric layers - but not in so many different directions. Visual mirage at Bentwaters seems to be out of the question because of the combined ground and airborne observations; the C47 pilot apparently saw the UFO below him. The visual objects do not seem to have been meteors; statements by the observers that meteors were numerous imply that they were able to differentiate the UFO from the meteors. In summary, this is the most puzzling and unusual case in the radar-visual files. The apparently rational, intelligent behavior of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of this sighting. However, in view of the inevitable fallibility of witnesses, more conventional explanations of this report cannot be entirely ruled out. sources:'UFOs over Lakenheath in 1956', by James E.

S. government in the Boumount Ridge section of Jasper, Colorado, in the summer of 1956. The government moved the flying saucer to a remote area called Wild Fork, where they ran tests on it, eventually figuring out how to fly this spaceship. The above photo was taken by a government official during one of the many test flights. At sunset on July 17, 1956, Miles Oman, a farmer in Jasper, Colorado, was getting ready to call it a day. He was walking back to his house when this strange, oval-shaped object in the sky caught his eye. It looked like a spaceship. The object zipped across the sky and was gone. This sighting kicked off one of the most amazing UFO incidents in the history of the world. For approximately two months, the town of Jasper and the surrounding areas experienced one unusual event after another. Scientists rushed in to investigate, reporters rushed in looking for stories, and government officials rushed in to keep it a secret from the world.

The lead came in a brief message from AdmiralDelmar S. Fahrney, former Navy missile chief, whom I had known for years.'Captain James Taylor, USN, Rte., has an important UFO sighting made by anaval pilot and his crew. Call him at Spacetronics, Inc., in Washington,District 7-9481.'That night, when Captain Taylor gave me this dramatic Navy report, I couldsee why it had never been released to the public. Later, Admiral Fahrneyand I met at the Army-Navy Club and discussed the details. Fahrney knew,as well as I did, of other hidden UFO cases - some of them highlysignificant. But this one stood out in importance.It had happened in 1956. Cruising at 19,000 feet, a Navy R7V-2 transport - a four-engine Super-Constellation - was flying west across the AtlanticOcean. The next stop was Gander, Newfoundland. Final destination, NavalAir Station, Patuxent, Maryland.The night was clear, visibility unlimited. In the senior pilot\'s seat,Commander George Benton was checking the dim-lit instruments. At thirty-four,Benton had a decade of Navy flying behind him. He had made the Atlanticcrossing more than two hundred times. Back in the cabin were two extraNavy air crews, en route home from foreign duty. Most of these men wereasleep. Including Benton\'s regular and relief crews, there were nearly30 airmen-pilots, navigators and flight engineers aboard the Constellation.As Commander Benton finished his cockpit check, he glanced out at the stars.Then he leaned forward, puzzled. A few minutes before, the sea below hadbeen dark. Now there was a cluster of lights, like a village, abouttwenty-five miles ahead.Benton looked over at his co-pilot, Lieutenant Peter W. Mooney. 'What doyou make of those lights?' Mooney peered down, startled.'Looks like a small town!''That\'s what I thought.' Benton quickly called the navigator, LieutenantAlfred C. Erdman. 'We must be way off course. There\'s land down there.''It can\'t be land.' Erdman hurried forward from his map table. 'That laststar sight shows...' He broke off, staring down at the clustered lights.'Well?' said Benton. 'They must be ships,' said Erdman. 'Maybe a rendezvousfor some special operation.'Giant Flying Saucers'They don\'t look like ships,' said Benton. He called Radioman John Wiggins.No word of any unusual ship movements, Wiggins reported. And no signals fromthe location of the lights. If they were ships, they were keeping radiosilence. 'Wake up those other crews,' Benton told Erdman. 'Maybe somebodycan dope it out.' In a few moments, two or three airmen crowded into thecockpit. Benton cut off the automatic pilot, banked to give them and the menin the cabin a better view.As the transport began to circle, the strange lights abruptly dimmed. Thenseveral colored rings appeared, began to spread out. One, Benton noticed,seemed to be growing in size. Behind him, someone gave an exclamation.Benton took another look. That luminous ring wasn\'t on the surface - itwas something rushing up toward the transport.'What the devil is it?' said Mooney. 'Don\'t know,' muttered Benton. Herolled the Constellation out of its turn to start a full-power climb. Thenhe saw it was useless. The luminous ring could catch them in seconds.The glow, he now saw, came from the rim of some large, round object. Itreached their altitude, swiftly took shape as a giant disc-shaped machine.Dwarfing the Constellation, it raced in toward them. 'It\'s going to hit us!'said Erdman. Benton had known normal fear, but this was nightmare. Numbed,he waited for the crash.Suddenly the giant disc tilted. Its speed sharply reduced, it angled on pastthe port wing. The commander let out his breath. He looked at Mooney\'s whiteface, saw the others\' stunned expressions. Watching out the port window, hecautiously started to bank. He stopped as he saw the disc.It had swung around, was drawing abreast, pacing them at about one hundredyards. For a moment he had a clear glimpse of the monster. Its sheer bulkwas amazing; its diameter was three to four times the Constellation\'s wingspan. At least thirty feet thick at the center, it was like a gigantic dishinverted on top of another. Seen at this distance, the glow along the rimwas blurred and uneven. Whether it was an electrical effect, a series ofjet exhausts or lights from opening in the rim, Benton could not tell. Butthe glow was bright enough to show the disc\'s curving surface, giving a hintof dully reflecting metal.Though Benton saw no signs of life, he had a feeling they were being observed.Fighting an impulse to dive away, he held to a straight course. Gradually, thestrange machine pulled ahead. Tilting its massive shape upward, it quicklyaccelerated and was lost against the stars.Commander Benton reached for his microphone, called Gander Airport andidentified himself. 'You show any other traffic out here?' he asked thetower. 'We had something on the scope near you,' Gander told him. 'But wecouldn\'t get an answer.''We saw it,' Benton said grimly. 'It was no aircraft.' He gave the towera concise report, and back at Gander teletype messages were rushed to theU.S. Air Defense Command, the Commanding Officer, Eastern Sea Frontier, theDirector of Air Force Intelligence and the Air Technical Intelligence Center.When the Constellation landed at Gander, Air Force intelligence officers metthe transport. From the start, it was plain they accepted the giant discsighting as fact. For two hours, Benton and the rest were carefullyinterrogated[debriefed, separately and together: How close did the objectcome? What was its size... estimated rate of climb... any electricalinterference noted... what happened to the other luminous rings?From the answers to scores of questions, the majority opinion emerged. Theflying disc was between 350 and 400 feet in diameter, and apparently metallic.No interference with ignition noted; instruments not observed and radio notoperating during this brief period. Time for the giant disc to climb to thetransport\'s altitude, between five and eight seconds, indicated speed between1,400 and 2,200 knots; the disc had accelerated above this speed on departure.Not all the men in the cabin had seen the luminous rings. Of those who had,most were watching the huge disc approach and did not see the 'rings'disappear. If they, too, were flying discs, in a rendezvous as somesuggested, they apparently had raced off while the other one was checkingon the Constellation.At one point, an Intelligence captain asked Benton if he had seen anyindication of life abroad the disc.Intelligently Controlled'No, but it was intelligently controlled, that\'s certain. Benton looked athim closely. 'That size, it would hardly be remote-controlled, would it?''I couldn\'t say,' replied the Air Force man. Nor would he tell what theGander Airport radar had shown about the disc\'s speed and maneuvers.'What\'s behind all this?' demanded Mooney. 'Up to now, I believed theAir Force. You people say there aren\'t any flying saucer...''Sorry, I can\'t answer any questions,' said the captain. 'Why not? After a scare like that, we\'ve got a right to know what\'s going on.' The Intelligence officer shook his head. 'I can\'t answer any questions,' he repeated.As quickly as possible, intelligence reports with full details were flashedto the four Defense commanders already notified, with an extra message forthe Director of Naval Intelligence. After the Constellation reachedPatuxent, the air crews were interviewed [debriefed again, by Navy order.Each man made a written report, with his opinion of what he had seen.Five days later, Commander Benton had a phone call from a scientist in ahigh government agency. 'I\'m informed you had a close-up UFO sighting.I\'d like to see you.'Benton checked, found the man was cleared by the Navy. Next day, thescientist appeared, showed his credential, listened intently to Benton\'sreport. Then he unlocked a dispatch case and took out some photographs.'Was it like any of these?' At the third picture, Benton stopped him.'That\'s it!' He looked sharply at the scientist. 'Somebody must knowthe answers, if you\'ve got photographs of the things.' The other mantook the pictures. 'I\'m sorry, Commander.' He closed his dispatchcase and left.At the time when I (Donald Keyhoe) learned of this case, I had servedfor two years as Director of the National Investigations Committee onAerial Phenomena.source:Flying Saucer Review, Volume 49/2, Summer 2004, pp. 21-23From the NICAP records, by Major Donald E.

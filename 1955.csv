1955,'The 1955 Bexleyheath UFO Encounter On July 17, 1955, an unidentified flying object was spotted in the Bexleyheath area by several people.Now a former policeman is doing research on the sightings. Two Bexley men, both now in their 60s, have recently been reliving their own X-Files experiences from their childhood.Rodney Maynard, from Belvedere, who is now 62, has contacted the News Shopper to reveal he was one of the youngsters who saw the UFO featured in our September 4 edition.Retired policeman John Hanson, from the West Midlands, was appealing for a group of children who saw the craft land in the King Harold\'s Way area of Bexleyheath in 1955 to get in touch with him, as he is researching the incident for a book.Mr Maynard was 15 at the time and was working as a labourer on a building site in nearby Streamway.He remembers the incident vividly.'We were on our lunch break when we heard something was happening in King Harold\'s Way. So we went up there to have a look.'This thing had landed in the roadway. It took up the whole width of the road and overlapped onto the pavements.'It wasn\'t on the ground, it had about eight massive suckers. The centre was still, but the outer rim was spinning slowly and it had white lights flashing, like a camera flash,' he recalled.'There were about 30 of us staring at it. We could hear it humming.'It had what looked like windows but the glass was concave and moulded together so you couldn\'t see in. A couple of us went forward to try and touch it and it began to spin faster.'Then it lifted slowly off the ground and hovered above our heads, tilting slightly.'The craft moved slowly until it was over Bedonwell Primary School, where it stayed for about a minute, then shot up into the sky and disappeared.Mr Maynard, whose 16-year-old brother also saw the craft said: 'It was black, sleek and streamlined with a surface like polished metal. It was very fine and beautiful. It certainly wasn\'t a prank.'He went on: 'I have never forgotten it but I don\'t talk about it because people would think you were barmy.'We used to talk about it among ourselves but our mums kept telling us we hadn\'t seen anything.'As well as his brother, Mr Maynard listed several other pals who were also there: 'Ron Deadman, Tony Savin, Vic Clarke, Tommy Staggs, we were all there.'Ken Fairman knows just how he feels.Mr Fairman, from Bexleyheath, says he saw a very similar craft with his pal Roy Beadle three years before, in 1952.They were out walking Ray\'s dog at an old farmstead in Bexleyheath known as The Warren (now the Warren Road area).'It was late afternoon. We had just come home from Bexleyheath School and we had Ray\'s young border collie with us. We saw it come down and hover about 18ft above the ground. There was no noise at all. We threw ourselves down on the ground and watched it. The dog which was young and usually lively, lay down between us. We lost all track of time.'It was about 20 or 30ft wide, with terrifically bright white lights underneath. It looked very similar to the drawing in your September 4 issue. Then it shot off and disappeared from view before you could click your fingers.'I could still take you to the exact spot. I don\'t know how long we watched for but I got told off for being late home for tea. I told my parents but they thought I was crackers.'Margaret Fry was also a witness to this UFO encounter.Margaret, who lived in Hythe Avenue, was making her way to her doctor\'s surgery. She and the doctor, Dr Thukarta, both saw what she described as an 'enormous craft' hovering over the doctor\'s car. She described the craft as saucer-shaped with a 'blue/silver/grey/pewter texture, yet, none of those colours.' Mrs Fry said it also had what looked like three spheres inset into its base, one of which 'flopped out', landing on the ground at the junction of nearby Ashbourne and Whitfield Road. A group of twelve children who were playing nearby saw it and went over to have a closer look, before it rose up from the ground and into the sky, disappearing from sight after a few minutes. Dr Thukarta died in 1965,  but Mr. Hanson has spoken at length to Mrs Fry, who now lives in North Wales, about her experience. 4:14 pm Monday 16th September 2002Also see 1955 UFO Landing at Bexleysource:By Linda Piperhttp://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/bromley/display.var.625555.index.0.html ', ' 1955 - US Senators See Flying Saucers In Soviet Russia One of the most powerful U.S. senators in modern history actually eye-witnessed two UFOs while on a fact-finding trip through Russia in 1955, and the U.S. government kept the sightings a secret for more than three decades.  The incredible encounter is detailed in 12 TOP SECRET CIA, FBI, and Air Force reports-and declassified in 1985.  Those startling reports reveal that Senator Richard B. Russell, Jr. (D-GA), then chairman of the Armed Services Committee-was on a Soviet train when he spotted a disc-shaped craft taking off near the tracks.  He hurriedly called his military aide and interpreter to the window and they saw the UFO, plus another one that appeared a minute later. The astonished trio reported the sightings to the U.S. Air Force as soon as they were out of Russia.   'The three observers were firmly convinced that they saw a genuine flying disc,' says an Air Force Intelligence report, dated October 14, 1955, and classified TOP SECRET at the time.  Senator Russell served 38 years in the Senate.  He was its senior, and one of the most influential senators at the time of his death in 1971.  He was chairman of the Armed Services Committee from 1951 to 1969, and unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1952.  The  mind-boggling documents detailing his UFO encounter were made available by the Fund for UFO Research and its chaiman, Dr. Bruce Maccabee.  Several key documents were obtained by the group through the Freedom of Information Act.  'These long secret documents are of major importance because they show for the first time that one of the most powerful U.S. Senators witnessed and reported a UFO,' said Dr. Maccabee.   The Air Force Intelligence report says Russell and his two traveling companions spotted the UFOs on October 4, 1955, while traveling by rail across Russia\'s Transcaucasus region.  'One disc ascended almost vertically, at a relatively slow speed, with its outer surface revolving slowly to the right, to an altitude of about 6000 feet, where its speed then increased sharply as it headed north,' the report states.  'The second flying disc was seen performing the same actions about one minute later. The take-off area was about 1-2 miles south of the rail line.'   Russell 'saw the first flying disc ascend and pass over the train,' and went 'rushing in to get Mr Efron (Ruben Efron, his interpreter) and Col. Hathaway (Col. E. U. Hathaway, his aide) to see it,' the report said.  'Col. Hathaway stated that he got to the window with the Senator in time to see the first (UFO), while Mr. Efron said that he got only a short glimpse of the first.  However, all three saw the second disc and all agreed that they saw the same round, disc-shaped craftas the first.'  The Air Force report was written by Lieut. Col. Thomas Ryan, who interviewed Senator Russell\'s companions in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on October 13, after they arrived there from Russia shortly after the sighting.   In his report, Col. Ryan called the sightings 'an eyewitness account of the ascent and flight of an unconventional craft by three highly reliable United States observers.  He added that Col. Hathaway led off his account of the sightings by saying:  'I doubt if your going to believe this, but we all saw it.'  Senator Russell was the first to see this flying disc we\'ve been told for years that there isn\'t such a thing, but all of us saw it.'   CIA documents show that the agency later interviewed the three eyewitnesses in the Russell party and also a fourth person, unidentified in the reports, who had seen the UFOs.  An eyewitness, whose name was blacked out on the CIA report prior to its declassification, said one of the UFOs 'had a slight dome on top' and also a 'white light on top.'  The edge of the disc was glowing pinkish-white, he added. The UFO rose 'vertically with the glow moving slowly around the perimeter in a clockwise direction, giving the appearance of a pinwheel.'   Interpreter Ruben Efron told the CIA that visibility was excellent.  As one UFO approached the train, he said, 'the object gave the impression of gliding.  No noise was heard and no exhaust was heard, and no exhaust glow or trail was seen by me.'  After the encounter, Senator Russell told the men with him:  'We saw a flying disc.  I wanted you boys to see it so that I would have witnesses,' according to the CIA documents.'  And an FBI memo, dated November 4, 1955, also discusses the sighting and admitted Col. Hathaway\'s testimony 'would support existence of a flying disc.'  Dr. Maccabee, of the Fund for UFO Research, believes that Senator Russell and his group never publicly revealed their incredible sightings 'because they were no doubt advised not to talk.  These documents provide startling new evidence that UFOs exist.'   Mr. Tom Towers, in his January 20, 1957, column, \'Aviation News,\' for the Los Angeles, CA, Examiner, printed the contents of a letter from Senator Russell, which was in response to a request for information about the sightings in Russia.  Mr. Towers had originally contacted Senator Russell\'s office by letter with the request that he be given permission to 'break' the story.  The Senator wrote:  'Permit me to acknowledge your letters relative to reports that have come to you regarding aerial objects seen in Europe last year.  I received your letter, but I have discussed this matter with the affected agencies of the government, and they are of the opinion that it is not wise to publicize this matter at this time.  I regret very much that I am unable to be of assistance to you.' The letter was dated 17 January, 1956. (Source: http://www.nuforc.org/LB5510.html ) '

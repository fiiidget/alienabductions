  THE INTELLIGENCE OFFICE REPORTS THAT IT GAINED POSSESSION OF THE
"DIS:" THROUGH THE COOPERATION OF A ROSWELL RANCHER AND SHERIFF
GEORGE WILSON OF ROSWELL.
  THE DISC LANDED ON A RANCH NEAR ROSWELL SOMETIME LAST WEEK.  NOT
HAVING PHONE FACILITIES, THE RANCHER, WHOSE NAME HAS NOT YET BEEN
OBTAINED, STORED THE DISC UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HE WAS ABLE TO
CONTACT THE ROSWELL SHERIFF'S OFFICE.
  THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE IN TURN NOTIFIED A MAJOR OF THE 509TH
INTELLIGENCE OFFICE.
  ACTION WAS TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AND THE DISC WAS PICKED UP AT THE
RANCHER'S HOME AND TAKEN TO THE ROSWELL AIR BASE.  FOLLOWING
EXAMINATION, THE DISC WAS FLOWN BY INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS IN A SUPER-
FORTRESS TO AN UNDISCLOSED "HIGHER HEADQUARTERS."
  THE AIR BASE HAS REFUSED TO GIVE DETAILS OF CONSTRUCTION OF THE DISC
OR OF ITS APPEARANCE.
  RESIDENTS NEAR THE RANCH ON WHICH THE DISC WAS FOUND REPORTED
SEEING A STRANGE BLUE LIGHT SEVERAL DAYS AGO ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN
THE MORNING.

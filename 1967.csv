1967,'Triangular Hovering Object over Ft. Smith, Arkansas, '67 or '68I wonder why I never hear anything about this event. It's like it never happened and at least 500 people (probably more than 1000) witnessed it. We were outside our home at ((street number deleted)) North 36th in Fort Smith, Arkansas. My mother, father and myself were there. Our neighbors were in their front yards. Suddenly in the sky a triangular shaped object appeared right above our home not 100 yards (app.) above us. It had three lights on it with one on each corner. We all saw it at the same time, as did many people over the whole city of Fort Smith, Arkansas. The radio station started reporting on it after many calls. A well-known preacher in Fort Smith was praying about it, and the radio station had everyone gather at the Pepsi or Coca Cola bottling plant and there were at least 1000 people gathered there who had seen the object/objects all over the city. The preacher also was there and it was quite an event. It was in the news for a couple of days, and then some hokey story about a weather balloon was released and suddenly the story was cold. In the past few years I have spoken to people who did see it and remember it well, and we all remember the event and wish we knew more about it. The craft we saw could move very suddenly very fast and just stop and hover in the air. No one had ever seen anything like it. Last year, I heard from a man who had been stationed at Fort Chaffee (just southeast of the city) who was looking for people who remembered the event. He said he had never gotten it out of his mind. He is out of the service now and lives in Florida. I would love to know if anyone has reported this at this website or remembers it as I do. My sister was in Oklahoma at the time and she and her boyfriend saw it from the bridge that leads from Oklahoma into Fort Smith. Would love to hear more from anyone about this event. The date may not be correct, but it was around that time. By the way, many people reported that the lights changed colors on the craft.

Two on duty uniformed police officers, PC CLIFFORD WAYCOTT and PC ROGER WILLEY had spotted a pulsating flying cross while driving between the above locations. It was seen at low altitude moving above the treetops of the surrounding countryside. Intrigued, they began to chase the UFO, however they were never able to significantly gain on it. At times the object slowed to 50 mph and at one point came to a stop in mid air. The pursuit involved speeds of up to 90 mph and covered a distance of 14 miles. Whenever they did gain a little ground on the object it would simply accelerate away from them. Eventually they reduced their speed fearing an accident themselves. The closest distance they reached to the UFO was 400 yards. At one point they stopped at a farm to wake up the owner so they could gain some corroboration that they were not mistaken in their sighting. At a later press conference PC WAYCOTT said, “The light wasn’t piercing but it was very bright. It was star-spangled - just like looking through wet glass and although we reached 90 mph it accelerated away from us.” Before the object disappeared from view they saw a second UFO that was also cross-shaped, very bright and made no noise. Both officers were impressed by the relevant speeds of the objects as they quickly departed, especially the first one. Enquiries at nearby RAF Chivenor proved negative. Within 48 hours numerous other witnesses began to report sightings of similar objects. A ‘fiery cross’ was witnessed above the skies of Glossop, Derbyshire by six police officers.On Duty sighting. 2 Officers. Source - UFO Flying Saucers over Britain by Robert Chapman.

Philip Lanning was driving south of town, on the evening of July 10, 1967, when his car coasted to a stop and the radio faded. Lanning got out and started to look at the car engine, when an enormous object flew over his head about 300 feet in the air. The object was silent and moving to the east. Lanning thought the object was about to crash. Just before the object reached a group of nearby trees, it tilted upward, turned right and then accelerated at great speed straight up into the low-flying clouds. The object was described as being 'like a cymbal on a drum set and was a dirty metallic gray in color on the underside'. He saw no portholes or hatches and said that it appeared to the size of house. Lanning wasn't sure who would be interested in the report, but he felt that it should be sent to someone in the US Government, so he forwarded it to a friend in Navel Intelligence. The Air Force eventually received it and began an investigation. They were impressed with Lanning as a witness as he was a former military officer who had received a great deal of training. After extensive research and interviews,  the Air Force was forced to label this sighting as unidentified. This was one of the very last reports in Bluebook to receive that tag. p>source:by Landon Howell  Owner & Editor - juiceenewsdaily.comhttp://www.juiceenewsdaily.com/0305/news/ufo_miss.html', 'Ririe, Idaho, November 2, 1967-Three-1/2 Foot Tall Creature Floats to GroundGuy Tossie and Will Begay, two Indian youths, were driving south on Highway 26 just outside Ririe on November 2, 1967, when, about 9:30 p.m., there was a sudden blinding flash of light in front of their car, followed by the abrupt appearance of a small, domed UFO. The dome was transparent and in it were seen two small, strange-looking occupants. The car was brought to a stop - Begay, driving, did not have to apply the brakes - and the object hovered about five feet above the highway immediately ahead of them. It was about eight feet wide, and flashed green and orange lights around the rim. The area was bathed in a vivid green light. The dome opened as if hinged and one creature emerged, apparently floating to the ground. It was about three and a half feet tall, and on its back was a kind of pack that protruded above and behind its head. Its face was oval and heavily pitted and creased. Two small, round eyes and a straight, slit-like mouth completed the facial features. Large ears stood high on the hairless head. Approaching the driver\'s side of the car, the alleged being opened the door and slid behind the wheel. Horrified, the two witnesses pushed over to the right. The car began to move - whether driven by the being or 'towed' by the UFO was uncertain. It was taken well out into a field of stubble wheat, and the UFO kept a fixed position a few feet in front of it. As the car stopped, Tossie, sitting next to the door, suddenly opened it and bolted, running for the nearby farmhouse of Willard Hammon about a quarter of a mile away. He later reported  being followed by a bright light - presumably carried by the second occupant. Meanwhile, in the car, Begay cowered in the front seat in a state of near-shock while the first creature jabbered unintelligibly at him, making sounds that were high and rapid, 'like a bird.' The second being, who had apparently given up chasing Tossie, returned to the car. The first then got out, and the two beings 'rose up and into the UFO,' which then ascended in a zigzag path. Meanwhile, at the home of Willard Hammon, Tossie could scarcely make himself understood by the astounded farmer and his family. After having calmed the Indian down, they accompanied him back to the field, where they found the car. Begay was sitting nearly speechless with fright, his eyes tightly closed. The engine was running and the lights were still on - about 15 minutes had elapsed from the moment the young men had seen the flash. Hammon listened to their story and then followed the frightened youths home in his car. Perplexed, he later stopped in a local bar and grill to see if he could learn anything more. While there, a county deputy sheriff stopped in and Hammon told him the story.Later, both witnesses also came by and voluntarily told the deputy sheriff, in their own words, what had happened. State Police were summoned and an investigation was begun. It was discovered that a number of local farmers had reported that their cattle had bolted during the evening for unknown reasons. Others claimed to have seen lights in the area. The report was investigated for NICAP by C.R. Ricks, of Idaho Falls. During his investigation, he learned of a man who claimed that, on the same night, he had a similar encounter. Ricks eventually tracked this man down and confirmed the report, although the witness was emphatic about not revealing his name, and was reluctant about discussing the details of his encounter. source:http://www.nicap.org/newlook/section_VII.htm', '1967, The Falcon Lake Landing, Stephen Michalak, UFO Casebook Case filesPublished: 10:50 AM 4/19/2002', 'The 1967 Abduction of Patrolman Herb Schirmer In Ashland, Nebraska, on December 3, 1967, Herbert Schirmer, a 22 years young patrolman, was making his usual rounds. He had checked the Ashland Sales Barn, and several gas stations along Highway 6 when he noticed what he thought were red lights on top of a large truck. He had just passed through the intersection of Highways 6 and 63 at about 2:00 AM.He drove the short distance down 63 and stopped with his headlights shining on the object. According to Schirmer, the object was definitely not a truck. The red lights that he had seen were blinking through the oval portholes of a metallic, oval-shaped object that was hovering at a height of about eight feet above the road\'s surface. The object appeared to have a polished, aluminum surface and had a sort of walk around it. It had a structure underneath, like a landing gear.As he watched, the object rose into the air with flames coming from underneath. It passed almost directly overSchirmer\'s patrol car, then quickly shot out of sight.Schirmer returned to the police station, noting that it was now 3:00 AM., which surprised him because he felt that only ten minutes had passed. At the station, he made this entry into his logbook: 'Saw a flying saucer at the junction of highways 6 and 63. Believe it or not!'Afterward, Schirmer developed a red welt on his neck, a headache, and he began to feel ill. Word of Schirmer\'s sighting was related to the Condon Commission at the University of Colorado, which investigated UFO reports. Schirmer was asked to come to Boulder, Colorado. At Boulder, on February 13, 1968, he was hypnotized by psychologist Dr. Leo Sprinkle of the University of Wyoming.  Under hypnosis, Schirmer recalled that, after he stopped his car near the object, the engine died and his radio went silent. A white object emerged from the craft and seemed to communicate mentally with him, preventing him from drawing his gun as he was want to do.After the hypnotic session had ended, Schirmer was able to recall even more details about the encounter. The beings were friendly, they drew energy from electrical power lines, and they had a base on Venus.The Condon Committee concluded that: 'Evaluation of psychological assessment tests, the lack of any evidence, and interviews with the patrolman, left project staff with no confidence that the trooper\'s reported UFO experience was physically real.'Psychologist Dr. Sprinkle, however, felt that Schirmer 'believed in the reality of the events he described.'Returning to Ashland, Schirmer was appointed Ashland\'s Police Chief when Chief Wlaskin resigned. However, he resigned after two months, unable to concentrate on the job due to his UFO experience.According to Schirmer, he was ridiculed by some of the townspeople, his car was dynamited, andhis wife left him.Further regression hypnosis sessions were conducted on June 8, 1968,  by hypnotist Loring G. Williams and the results of those sessions were reported in two books: 'Gods, Demons, and Space Chariots' and 'Gods and Devils fromOuter Space' by Eric Norman.One odd fact that was brought out was that the aliens wore uniforms with an emblem of a winged serpent on the left breast, similar to the winged serpents that have appeared in mythology around the world.', 'Idaho Falls, Idaho, December 8, 1967, UFO with Occupants A report that contains some striking similarities to Mrs. Moreland\'s story of more than eight years before was investigated by C. Reed Ricks, who sent NICAP the details. On the night of December 8, 1967, Marilyn Wilding, age 15, of Idaho Falls, went out on her front step to look for a friend coming by to pick her up. It was about 7:40 p.m. The evening was dark and overcast, cold, with snow on the ground. Miss Wilding\'s attention was attracted to a light source reflecting on the snow and glancing upward she saw a large light above, partially obscured by the roof of her house.  Stepping out into the yard, she saw a large, brightly lighted object hovering not far above the end of her home. It was so bright that she was unable to perceive any other color than white. The object was circular in shape, 'about as big as a car.'  She told the NICAP investigator that it was close enough for some one to have thrown a rock at it and hit it. As she stood looking, the object tipped and rotated partly so that she was able to see that it had a domed top. In the dome, which was transparent, she could make out the indistinct outlines of two figures, but she was unable to make out any details because of the glare. She ran into her house and called for her younger sister to come and look, but the youngster was barefoot and did not come out. Miss Wilding then ran back outside in time to see the object begin to rotate, in a clockwise direction as seen from below. It maintained its tilted attitude while rotating, and therefore gave the appearance of wobbling. With this motion, it began moving away toward the north. As it receded into the distance, the light dimmed and turned orange in color.  The UFO\'s departure was observed from inside the house by Miss Wilding\'s younger brothers and sister, who had been alerted by the witness. (Mr. and Mrs. Wilding were not at home at the time of the incident occurred.) In her written report, Miss Wilding also gave the names of the Schuldt family, neighbors, as witnesses.  At its closest, the object was no more than 100 yards away, and from 50 to 100 feet above the ground. The incident lasted for approximately three minutes. Besides containing a number of details similar to those described by Mrs. Moreland, Miss Wilding\'s sighting may also be compared with another incident that occurred at Ririe, Idaho, a little more than a month earlier.  The six preceding occupant reports have one thing in common: the reported beings in each case were seen in or on the associated UFO. Also, five of the six reports took place during the decade of the 1950s. This is not to say that all occupant reports during that period described beings seen in or on the object; to the contrary, there are many reports on file in which the alleged occupants were reported outside of the UFO; and in some cases, strange non-human entities have been reported when no UFO could be immediately associated with their presence.  The following cases are examples of occupant reports in which the alleged beings were seen outside of the UFOs. All of them have occurred since 1964. Several of these cases contain features that are unique and bizarre: their reported high degree of strangeness places special demands upon our credulity. However, they cannot be eliminated out of hand simply because they do not conform to what we would prefer to expect of 'spacemen' reports.  source:', '1967, UFO Visits Ontario LakeWhat could be better than to be visiting Canada, a beautiful lake, night air, moonlit water? What a peaceful, relaxing idea that is. Unfortunately for two people, all of these nice things turned into a frightening experience, and changed their lives forever. From the notes of researcher Dr. Peter Millman comes this true story. At the time of this story, Millman was working for the Nation Research Council of Canada. He received the facts of the case from the Department of National Defense.The two people, who gave their report to Canadian officials, have asked to remain anonymous, for fear of ridicule. It was on June 18, 1967 that their case begins. Taking a nice, peaceful boat right down a northern Ontario lake, Mr. and Mrs. G. were visiting friends, and began their ride back to their cabin. As they are enjoying the moonlit night, they were suddenly shocked to see a brilliant object of unknown object. This object was simply hovering about 50 feet above tree level, and approximately one-quarter of a mile away from them. Slowing their boat down, they make a turn to get a full view of this strange object. As they sit in wonder, suddenly the object begins to pick up speed, racing straight toward them! Regaining his composure, Mr. G revs up his 75 horsepower motor, and gives it all it's got, heading to the lake's shore. The distance between themselves and the object allows them just enough time to arrive on the bank. They quickly exit the boat. Looking back up into the sky, they see the object has taken back it's original position. After a few minutes of time, Mr. and Mrs. G decide to try a return trip back down the river to their neighbors' house. Shortly after launching into the water, the object again makes a move to descend upon the two terrified witnesses. Again outracing the craft to the shore, the two ditch the boat, and run to another house, loudly and excitedly rousing their acquaintances. Their friends would later state that Mr. and Mrs. G were honestly and profoundly frightened to death by what they had seen.Now there were several more witnesses to this unusual, brilliant object..just hovering above the trees that surrounded the quiet waters of the lake. They watch the object for another 10-15 minutes until finally it races into the night to the west-northwest. Knowing that they had seen something quiet extraordinary, they make a full report of the incident. This unusual occurrence was meticulously detailed by Canada's National Defense team. Other details derived from a thorough questioning of the witnesses revealed several important facts. The object, though it did not show a light of any kind, caused the trees to move below it, as it hovered. The craft was distinguishable from the moon, as both objects could be clearly detailed simultaneously. The object was a traditional oval shape with a dome on top, estimated at 25-30 feet across, and 10-15 feet tall. Though the object rapidly streaked through the sky, no sound was heard by the witnesses, nor other guests at cabins in the vicinity. One guest did observe that at about the time of the incident, he was listening to his radio, when it suddenly went dead. Later in the evening, it was working fine again. The investigative team discovered a number of broken, wilted limbs directly below where the object had hovered. An analysis was made in Winnipeg, and the results of that examination was that no reasonable explanation could be offered for the damage to the tree limbs. The report also stated that the limbs showed signs of heat, and the samples contained no diseases or insect infestation. This is a classic case of an encounter of the second kind. This case was very well documented, and the object was listed as unexplained.'

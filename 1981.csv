Nathan, a notorious UFO sceptic, stated that he could find no evidence of a fake.   Certainly, for many who have examined the three images, the first shot is the most impressive. In it, the orange glowing craft can be seen through the windshield of the car, and light from the object is reflected both off the car's bonnet and off the metal guard rail by the side of the road. These, in particular, are details that experts claim are extremely difficult to fake. VIDEO EVIDENCE Mexican UFOlogist Jaime maussan was so intrigued by Carlos Diaz's account of his experiences that he provided him with a video camera and asked him to see if he could record the UFO on tape when it next appeared. A few weeks later, Diaz awoke at 5 a.m. and grabbed his camera. he walked out and waited. Apparently, within minutes, the craft appeared and hovered over the house, where Diaz filmed it. When Maussan saw the remarkable footage, he asked Diaz if he could get even closer to the craft while filming. Two months later, Diaz was once again able to film the craft, which this time hovered directly above him, without moving. However it is Diaz's third attempt to capture the craft on video that is the most spectacular. In this footage, Diaz having mounted his camera on a tripod, walks to the bottom of a field waving a flash light. Responding to this, the craft suddenly materializes directly above Diaz's head and sends beams of light down towards him. Then, the unidentified object remains motionless for 30 seconds, before blinking out. It is universally recognized that this video contains some of the best UFO footage ever taken. source:This article originally appeared in issue 89 of The X Factor.

The UFO Casebook has a  transcription  of this taped session.                   Betty Cash, one of three people injured in a UFO close encounter                  near Huffman, Texas, on December 29, 1980, died on the 18th                  anniversary of the event, in Birmingham, Alabama. She had been in                  poor health ever since the encounter. At the time of the event, Mrs.                  Cash operated her own businesses near Dayton, Texas.                    Betty Cash, along with Vickie Landrum and grandson Colby                  Landrum, encountered a huge UFO accompanied by military                  helicopters on a dark road in the east Texas Piney Woods. They                  were exposed to radiation from the object, which caused extreme                  medical problems such as burns, eye damage, hair loss, diarrhea, and                  vomiting. Although they and others observed a large number of                  military helicopters along with the UFO, the U.S. Government                  refused to acknowledge the event or assist them in any way.                    After the encounter, Betty Cash was hospitalized and treated for                  burns and the other maladies. The extent of the injuries was so great,                  she was forced to close her businesses and never worked again. He                  life became a series of hospital stays, many of them in intensive care.                  Eventually, she developed cancer, which was successfully treated. In                  November 1998, Mrs. Cash suffered a stroke. On December 29,                  during her recovery, an unusual turn of events claimed her life.                    Mrs. Cash was a hero in the fight against government UFO                  cover-ups and brought hope to other victims of UFO incidents. She                  was devoted to family and friends and never allowed her illness to                  prevent her from helping others to cope with the trauma of UFO                  close encounters.                                Betty Cash will be missed... but never forgotten.                    Peter A. Gersten Director        In 1981 I represented three People in a lawsuit against the United                  States Government for injuries that resulted from their contact with                  an unusual aerial object. Betty Cash, Vicky Landrum and Colby                  Landrum are the only three People to ever sue our government for                  injuries from a UFO. On the eighteenth anniversary of her                  encounter, Betty Cash died.                    Betty Cash was a warrior and heroine. She fought the US                  government and, even in defeat, showed a spirit and tenacity that will                  now be her epitaph. CAUS and I pay tribute to a very brave                  lady... and a victim of this government's callousness to the rights of                  the individual.

1948,'1948, The Aztec UFO CrashIn 1950, controversial author Frank Scully released the book, 'Behind the Flying Saucers.'This effort, written during the beginnings of UFO awareness in the United States, was considered to contain fabricated, or sensationalized accounts of four UFO crashes. One of the accountscovered an alleged crash at Aztec, New Mexico in 1948, only a brief period of time after thefamous Roswell incident.Scully\'s information came largely from a mysterious Dr. Gee. Depending on which commentaryyou read, the identity of this physician is attributed to either a real doctor, or a fictitiousperson who was composed of elements of several different witnesses. Scully described the Azteccrash as that of a craft which was measured at exactly 99.99 feet in diameter, covered by a material which resembled a light weight,  shiny metal that possessed incredible strength anddurability. It seems that nothing on this earth could penetrate or damage the hull of this craftfrom another world.The disc shaped craft had large metallic rings revolving around a central core, which wassupposedly the control bridge of the object. The hull of the craft contained no apparent seams, rivets, or any hint of the material being pieced together.As the story goes, the investigatingteam gained access to its interior by the use of a long pole which they pushed through a portholein the saucer. A knob was engaged which opened a previously hidden door. Once inside, theteam found 16 small humanoid beings, all dead, their bodies charred from fire. The aliens heightwas reported as 36-42 inches. The exterior of the craft was not damaged. The inside showedthat the craft was put together with a framework of grooves and pins.The craft and the alien bodies were allegedly sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Othersupporting evidence of the Aztec crash was said to have surfaced in 1987 from one WilliamSteinman, but his sources were never verified. Steinman asserted that the crash occurred onMarch 25, 1948, and was verified by three different radar stations. Steinman\'s account listed14 dead aliens instead of 16. Until supporting evidence of Scully\'s or Steinman\'s accountcan be obtained, the Aztec crash story remains an unsolved mystery.(B J Booth)', 'The Chiles/Whitted Sighting 1948A classic UFO event that has all but been forgotten is the Chiles-Whitted sighting which unfolded over Montgomery, Alabama on July 24 1948. This case was one of the very first reports of a large UFO officially made by commercial airplane pilots. The experience was a one of a kind for the two seasoned pilots, Captain Clarence S. Chiles, and co-pilot John B. Whitted. While flying an Eastern Airlines DC-3 from Houston, Texas to Atlanta, Georgia they encountered a huge cigar-shaped UFO which barely missed them. This extraordinary event transpired while the DC-3 was cruising 5,000 feet above the city of Montgomery, Alabama.The first part of their journey was a pleasant, uneventful one until 2:45 A.M. Their relaxed cruising mode was suddenly interrupted by the sight of what seemed to be a dullish-red glowing object, directly in their flight path. Still at a distance, the two pilots first impression was that they were looking at a jet, unreported, and coming right at them! The glowing object barely missed them, passing on their starboard side at a distance of about 1,000 feet, according to Chiles. Whitted would later estimate the distance at somewhat more than Chiles\' guess.The two pilots both agreed that the object had no wings or tail section. Both also agreed seeing at least two rows of windows from which appeared a glowing like 'burning magnesium.' The object had a pointed nose section, and there was a 'bluish glow' running on it\'s belly from nose to it\'s end. Out of it\'s rear end, an 'orange-red' exhaust was seen by the two unnerved crewmen. This so-called emission was as long again as the object\'s body. Both pilots were also in agreement that the object\'s length was approximately that of a B-29 bomber, though somewhat thicker.Captain Chiles\' first reaction was to turn his DC-3 off to the left, as the object seemed to be coming slightly to his right. Both pilots clearly witnessed the oncoming craft do an abrupt pull-up, just after missing them. Only Whitted was able to view the object as it seemed to momentarily disappear after making a rapid vertical ascent. When asked later to elaborate on his description, he added, 'the object vanished instantaneously after its sharp pull-up.' The unusual object and it\'s dash at the DC-3 was fully reported to Eastern officials and Project Sign.Some further details were made available in this report. The two pilots stated that 'no disturbance was felt from airwaves, nor was there any wash or mechanical disturbance when the object passed.' Other witnesses would later disagree with this statement, and in the Naval Intelligence Report of the incident, it is stated by at least one of the passengers that the 'DC-3 was rocked by the wash from the object.' Witnesses also describe a sound like that of a V-2 rocket. Most of the passengers were, fortunately for them, asleep at the time of the occurrence. Clarence McKelvie, who was assistant editor of the American Education Press at Columbus, Ohio stated, 'I saw no shape or form. It was on the right side of the plane, and suddenly I saw this strange, eerie streak out of my window. It was very intense, not like lightning or anything I had ever seen before.'Chiles, Whitted, and McKelvie were not the only observers of this strange sight that morning. Several witnesses from Robbins Air Base, near Macon, Georgia stated they saw an object of the same description about 1/2 hour before the DC-3 sighting. The object was reported as travelling in a southerly direction at a high rate of speed. An official government investigation ruled out the possibility of a conventional aircraft after tracing flight records of 225 civilian and military flights that morning. Private debunkers, with no consideration of the facts, wrote the sighting off as an illusion due to temperature inversions, and then later assigned the sighting to a meteor. Project Sign would agree on the meteor theory, but in usual fashion, added that the description of the object and it\'s maneuvers did not match that of a meteor. This near-collision is still listed under the 'unexplained' category.', 'Lt. Gorman\'s Dogfight with a UFO, 1948One of the early 'classics' of UFO history involved Lieutenant George F. Gorman of the North Dakota Air National Guard, who said he had a twenty-seven minute 'dogfight' with a UFO in the skies above Fargo.Date: October 1, 1948-Location: Fargo, North Dakota Gorman, then manager of a Fargo construction company, told this story to Air Force investigators: On the night of October 1, 1948, he had been on a cross-country flight with his squadron. Upon return to Hector airport in Fargo, he elected to log some night flying time, so he remained airborne after the other planes had landed. He had circled his F-51 over the lighted football stadium and around the city and was preparing to land about 9 P.M. The control tower cleared him to land, advising him about a Piper Cub in the vicinity - the only other plane - and he could see the light aircraft outlined plainly about 500 feet below him. What appeared to be the taillight of a plane passed him on the right, but the tower insisted they knew of no other planes in the area. Gorman informed the tower that he was going to investigate the other aircraft and pulled his F-51 up and out toward the moving light. He closed to within about 1,000 yards and took a good look at the object. 'It was about six to eight inches in diameter, clear white, and completely round without fuzz at the edges [i.e., sharp and clear. It was blinking on and off. As I approached, however, the light suddenly became steady and pulled into a sharp left bank. I thought it was making a pass at the tower. I dived after it and brought my manifold pressure up to sixty inches but I couldn\'t catch up with the thing. It started gaining altitude and again made a left bank, I put my F-51 into a sharp turn and tried to cut the light off in its turn. By then we were at about 7,000 feet. Suddenly it made a sharp right turn and we headed straight at each other. Just when we were about to collide, I guess I got scared. I went into a dive and the light passed over my canopy at about 500 feet. Then, it made a left circle about 1,000 feet above, and I gave chase again.'Gorman said he cut sharply toward the light, which was once more coming at him. When collision again seemed imminent, the object shot straight up into the air in a steep climb-out, disappearing overhead. Gorman again attempted to pursue it but his plane went into a power stall at about 14,000 feet, and the object was not seen again. It was then 9:27 P.M. Gorman was so shaken by the encounter that he had difficulty handing his plane, although he was a veteran pilot and a flying instructor during World War II. He had noticed no sound, odor, or exhaust trail from the object during the 'dogfight,' and no deviation on his instruments. At times during the chase, he had pushed the F-51 to full power, sometimes reaching 400 mph. He described the object as round and somewhat flattened. In the airport control tower, traffic controllers Lloyd D. Jensen and H. E. Johnson also saw a strange light near the airfield: 'After passing to the east of the airport it seemed to take a northwest heading, The object seemed to be at about 2,000 feet and appeared to be traveling at quite an excessive speed compared to a Piper Cub that was east of the field at the time. No definite outline could be identified. Both objects [the UFO and the Piper Cub were sighted at the same time.'Jensen said that through binoculars he sighted, 'an object or a light traveling at a high rate of speed, apparently on a southwest heading. The F-51 [Gorman\'s plane was some distance behind and the object was traveling fast enough to increase the spacing between itself and the fighter. The object appeared to be only a round light, perfectly formed, with no fuzzy edges or rays leaving its body. The edges were clear cut. No other shape was observed. The main identifying characteristic was the high rate of speed at which it was apparently traveling.'The pilot of the Piper Cub, Dr. A. E. Cannon, and his passenger, Einar Nielson, also witnessed the swiftly moving light while in radio communication with the tower: 'While circling the football field at NDAC at 1,600 feet, Fargo tower advised us that there was an F-51 in the air and a few moments later asked us who the third plane might be,'Cannon said, 'We had noticed the 51 and when we were over the north side of Hector field going west, a light, seemingly on a plane, passed above and to the north, moving very swiftly toward the west. At first we thought it was the 51, but we then saw the light of the 51 higher and move over the field. We landed on Runway 3, taxied to the administration building, and went up to the tower and listened to the calls from the 51, which seemed to be trying to overtake the plane or lighted object, which then went southwest and over the city. The object was moving very swiftly, much faster than the 51. We tried to get a better view with a pair of binoculars, but couldn\'t follow it well enough.'In a statement to Major D. C. Jones, commander of the 17th Fighter Squadron at Hector airport, Gorman said he was convinced that there was 'thought' behind the maneuvers: 'I am also convinced that the object was governed by the laws of inertia because its acceleration was rapid but not immediate, and although it was able to turn fairly tight at considerable speed, it still followed a natural curve.'The object could outturn and outspeed the F-51, he said, and was able to attain a much steeper climb and to maintain a constant rate of climb far in excess of the F-51. 'When I attempted to turn with the object, I blacked out temporarily due to excessive speed,' Gorman stated. 'I am in fairly good physical condition and I do not believe there are many, if any, pilots who could withstand the turn effected by the light and remain conscious.'George F. Gorman retired from the Air Force in 1969 with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and was then living in Texas. B J Booth', '1948, The Death of Thomas MantellIn more recent years, additional information has come forward. Captain James F. Duesler, who was one of several military officers at Godman, was retired and living in England. In 1997, he stated that he and several other officers actually saw the gigantic UFO hovering over Godman field that day. Duesler, who was a pilot and crash investigator, stated, 'The UFO was a strange, gray-looking object, which looked like a rotating inverted ice cream cone.' Shortly after the crash, Duesler visited the site, and made these observations, 'The wings and tail section had broken off on impact with the ground, and were a short distance from the plane, he recalled. There was no damage to the surrounding trees and it was obvious that there had been no forward or sideways motion when the plane had come down. It just appeared to have 'belly flopped' into the clearing. 'There was very little damaged to the fuselage, which was in one piece, and no signs of blood whatsoever in the cockpit. 'There was no scratching on the body of the fuselage to indicate any forward movement and the propeller blade bore no telltale scratch marks to show it had been rotating at the time of impact, and one blade had been embedded into the ground. 'The damage pattern was not consistent with an aircraft of this type crashing at high speed into the ground. Because of the large engine in the nose of the plane, it would come down nose first and hit the ground at an angle. Even if it had managed to glide in, it would have cut a swath through the trees and a channel into the ground. None of these signs were present.'All indications were that it had just belly-flopped into the clearing. I must admit, I found this very strange.' To further debunk the 'Venus' theory, astronomical records indicated that the planet was only 33 degrees above the horizon at the time of the incident, thus totally eliminating it from the case. The Air Force, embarrassed by the 'Venus' theory falling through, now searched for another 'worldly' explanation for the object observed that day. After discovering that Naval research was sending up the enormous 'Skyhook' balloons, the Air Force had their alternate solution. This theory was also soon aborted after discovering that no balloon was launched, or could have been in the skies that day. The UFO theory received even more credence after Mantell\'s death. On January 8, residents of Clinton, North Carolina, reported a cone-shaped object moving through the skies at incredible speeds, and on February 1, a large metallic UFO was seen emitting an orange light near the ground at Circleville, Ohio. Whatever happened on the day that Thomas Mantell crashed his plane, it is certain that it was not a weather balloon, and it was not Venus, or any other planet. Could it have been a visitor from another planet, or another dimension? written by B J Booth'

1960,'The Official Explanation Corning, CaliforniaAugust 13, 196011:50 p.m.California Highway Patrol Officers Charles A. Garson and Stanley Scott were patrolling on Hoag Road, east of Corning, California when they saw what looked like a huge airliner descending from the sky in front of them. Thinking that a plane was about to crash, they stopped and got out of the car to get a better look. They watched as the object descended in complete silence to about 100 to 200 feet from the ground, then suddenly reversed and climbed back to about 500 feet from the ground and stopped. Officer Carson described it in a police teletype report: At this time it was clearly visible to both of us. It was surrounded by a glow making the round or oblong object visible. At each end, or each side of the object, there were definite red lights. At times about five white lights were visible between the red lights. As we watched the object moved again and performed aerial feats that were actually unbelievable. The officers radioed the Tehama County Sheriff\'s Office and asked Deputy Clarence Fry to contact the local Air Force radar station at Red Bluff. Deputy Fry reported back that the radar station verified that an unidentified object was visible on radar. As they continued to watch the object: On two occasions the object came directly towards the patrol vehicle; each time it approached, the object turned, swept the area with a huge red light. Officer Scott turned the red light on the patrol vehicle towards the object, and it immediately went away from us. We observed the object use the red beam approximately 6 or 7 times, sweeping the sky and ground areas. The object then began to move slowly to the east, and the officers followed. When they had reached the Vina Plains Fire Station, the object was approached by a second object that came from the south. The second object moved near to the first and both stopped and hovered for some time, occasionally emitting red beams. After a time, both objects vanished below the eastern horizon. They had observed the first object for a total of about two hours and fifteen minutes. When they returned to the Tehama County Sheriff\'s Office, they found that the object had also been seen by Deputies Fry and Montgomery, as well as by the night jailer. All described the same thing. The next day, Officers Carson and Scott drove to the Red Bluff Air Station to discuss the sighting and to speak to the operator that had seen it on radar. The Air Force, however, now denied that the object had been seen on radar, contradicting what the radar operator had told Deputy Fry the night before. The visit was completely unproductive. More information regarding the sighting was obtained by NICAP(National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) advisor Walter N. Webb, who contacted Carson and received a copy of the report, drawings of the object, and a letter from Carson. In the letter, dated November 14, 1960, Carson said: We made several attempts to follow it, or I should say get closer to it, but the object seemed aware of us and we were more successful remaining motionless and allow it to approach us, which it did on several occasions. In the original report, Carson also mentioned that: Each time the object neared us, we experienced radio interference. Again, from the letter to Webb: The object was shaped like a football, the edges, or I should say outside of the object were clear to us...[the glow was emitted by the object, was not a reflection of other lights.The Official Explanation   What was the 'official' explanation for the sighting? In a letter to a NICAP member, the Air Force said: The findings [are that the individuals concerned witnessed a refraction of the planet Mars and the bright stars Aldebaran and Betelgeux. . . [temperature inversions contributed to the phenomena as the planet Mars was quite low in the skies and the inversion caused it to be projected upward. They also said: A contributing factor to the sightings could have been the layer of smoke which hung over the area in a thin stratiform layer. This smoke came from the forest fires in the area hung in layer due to the stable conditions associated with the inversions. When NICAP pointed out that Mars, Aldebaran, and Betelgeuse were all below the horizon at the time of the sighting, the Air Force changed the star involved to Capella, which was slightly above the eastern horizon at the time. They neglected to explain the fact that, as the sighting progressed, Capella would have risen in the sky, whereas the objects disappeared below the eastern horizon at the end of the sighting. Officer Carson had this to say about the Air Force explanations: ... I have been told we saw Northern lights, a weather balloon, and now refractions.â€¦ I served 4 years with the Air Force, I believe I am familiar with the Northern lights, also weather balloons. Officer Scott served as a paratrooper during the Korean Conflict. Both of us are aware of the tricks light can play on the eyes during darkness. We were aware of this at the time. Our observations and estimations of speed, size, etc. came from aligning the object with fixed objects on the horizon. I agree we find it difficult to believe what we were watching, but no one will ever convince us that we were witnessing a refraction of light. A check of the meteorological records of the area for that night by atmospheric physicist James E. MacDonald failed to find any evidence that would indicate the presence of a temperature inversion. Over the next week, similar sightings were reported, including another sighting the very next evening by Deputies Fry and Montgomery that was also seen by a Corning police officer.

(Loy Lawhon) ', '1960\'s Grand Bend Kansas UFO Sighting by Dirk Vander PloegIn the early 1960\'s we lived in Kansas. We were small children then had a house on the North End of Great Bend, on the North end of Morton Street.One night in 1964 or 65, I looked out of the kitchen window and saw a \'white cube\' that glowed like a light bulb. It had a red light glowing on the inside of it. There are or were quite a few radio towers in the area and one huge TV 2 tower farther to the North. The \'cube shaped thing\' flew around that radio tower like a moth flies around a light bulb, only slower than a moth and it never hit the tower. Also, the red light was fading on an off like the tower light. Now, I believe the object was trying to communicate with the tower.When I first saw the object I was transfixed like a deer in headlights!I ran to get my dad but like most dads, he said not to bother him, so I ran back to the kitchen yelling for my two brothers to come. When I got back to the window it was still flying near the tower. Just before my brothers got to the window it traveled across the field towards me. It started hovering around 75 feet above the ground and was approximately 200 yards away. That\'s when my two brothers joined me at the window and started asking, 'What is that, what is that?'It spun so fast that it morphed into a spinning ball and appeared as a white streak as it shot almost straight up angling towards the North West and was gone. We were very excited at witnessing how it zoomed away. 'That was fast, really fast!', reverberated in the room.At the North end of the street was a wheat field, then to the North edge of that about one mile is the Dry Walnut Creek and on the North edge of that was the radio tower. The radio tower was around one and a quarter mile from the kitchen window where I first saw it. The 15 houses on our street, including ours, lined up along the wheat field East and West.Years ago a man asked me about the sighting. He showed me a lot of pictures of UFO\'s and asked if the object looked like any of them? When I said \'No', he suddenly wore a strange expression on his face. I have no idea who he was. All I know is that he was someone my dad knew. I would like to ask him where he got the pictures and if this sighting was some sort of simulation.The object was very clear, a perfect shaped cube - not at all blurry. As it flew around the tower it really tumbled and then sped across the field at 100 to 150 mph, rolled a little, but as it hovered it stayed on a perfectly flat plane and slowly turned. It glistened: not bright like a 100 watt light bulb but still glowing. The light was uniform throughout the object. The red light inside the craft disappeared after a few seconds, then it spun into a ball and left. As I mentioned the object was cube-shaped and reminds me now of the Star Trek Borg ships. I would like to know where the show\'s creator, Gene Roddenberry, got the idea for that cube ship, although, the only similarity between my sighting and the Borg cube was its shape.I believe we saw the object because we are not alone on this planet. Whatever we saw flying around that radio tower still intrigues me today!The way the craft moved makes me believe it was under intelligent control. It maneuvered deliberately from field to field, sped up and slowed down and changed height. It was the size of a small box truck: 20 feet wide by 20 feet long. Today, I believe that the craft was just curious as if it had just discovered us by perhaps following the TV signal with the sub carrier wave to its source.This is a true story and I wanted to share it.Sighting was reported by Wade Meyer and written with his assistance.Dirk Vander Ploeg is the editor and publisher of UFODigest.com and PsiTalk.com.

One of my friend\'s grandfather had (recently passed away) witnessed the incident. He stated that a total of three villages (Hamlets) witnessed the incident. The total number of witnesses to the incident is around 800-1000. It is documented at some sites on the Internet. Ijapada Chatterjee was working in his office at the mica mine outside Manbhum that day (he was the manager) when he heard the miners shouting. Rushing outdoors, Chatterjee 'watched a saucer-shaped object descend to an altitude of about 500 feet. The UFO hovered, then soared upwards at terrific speed, causing a tremendous gust of wind.' 'The object was seen over a mine which has supplied berylium for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.'source and references:Reporter\'s Name Withheld', 'Francis Ridge:Francis Ridge has been a Field Investigator since Novemberof 1960, at first with NICAP ( National Investigations Committee on AerialPhenomena), then later for CUFOS (Center for UFO Studies), and MUFON (Mutual\xa0UFO Network). His 40-plus years has involved investigations of hundredsof UFO reports, but few were as interesting as this Close Encounter, E-Mcase in October of 1973, right at the peak of a world-wide sighting wave.Francis Ridge:It was October 20, 1973, and near Mt. Vernon & Evansville,Indiana. This incident occurred during the massive sighting waveof 1973, and within a few days of one of our rare MADAR detections. Mywife got a call early that morning. I was at work. She told me that theman was very serious about something that had happened that morning. Theman calling was a conductor on a L&N train and had just had an encounterwith a UFO at 6:50 AM, just a few miles east of our home. To be precise,it was at a point on the tracks near St. Phillips, which is about 8-mileseast of us towards Evansvilles. I got in the car and headed home, calledthe man and taped the interview. Later I conducted a full investigation.\xa0The original train crew had experienced engine trouble near Upton, alittle town 3-4 miles northwest of Mt. Veron. One of the rear diesal unitshad been overheating and the Burlington engine was pulling a 6,000-tonload, overloaded under these conditions. The maintenance man at Upton wasa 30-year man and told the conductor that the rear unit was 'dead'and thatthere was, in his words, 'no use messin\' with it.' He\'d already tried.In any case, the new crew lumbered in to Mt. Vernon, taking 20-25 minuteslonger to get there than usual. The sky was clear, temperature was a cool55-degrees, wind was calm. Again, it was about 6:50 AM.\xa0They had gone through Mt. Vernon and were nearing the Lamont crossing,2-miles east of the city, heading east for Evansville. The sun was justbarely peeking over the tree tops. The two men in the front engine sawa very bright, but distant, light in the sky coming out of the north. Atfirst they thought it was an aircraft, then later decided that it couldn\'tbe. The object was very bright and was tracking north to south, pulsatingfrom real bright to dim to bright. The distant light appeared to travela short distance, 50-60\' between pulsations. The light finally turned moreeast towards Evansville and disappeared.\xa0When they neared Caborn (6-7 miles east of Mt. Vernon), the lead conductortold the rear conductors by intercom that they had seen a real bright light.Whenthey got near St. Phillips, the rear conductor reported that there nowwas a train following them, on the same track. By then they had gottenup on Belknap hill (at Peerlsess Crossing), 'a pretty good pull on a train',and had gotten hung up. One of the rear men suggested that they shouldget the train behind them, which he said had been following them for awhile,to push them. The lead conductor replied, 'Well, I haven\'t heard him onthe radio.' After a short while the rear man suggested the same solutionto the problem, again: 'Well, he\'s been following us and I can see hislight back there and the \'board\' is red!' The object following them hadgiven them a 'red board' on their blocking system. The signal referredto here is a series of lights, similar in color to regular traffic lights,situated on a pole on the side of the tracks. This shows either red, amber,or green, indicating 'danger' , 'caution', or 'all clear', respectively.(This signal is a part of the Automatic Blocking System which tells ofother traffic on the same track). The 'red board' normally meant that somethingwas on the track behind them. The rear conductor again suggested that thecrew call the 'tower' (Howell Round House at Evansville) and see if therewas a train behind them.\xa0A quick check with the yardmaster showed that there was no train behindthem at all. Upon receiving the news, the rear conductor replied, 'Thereis a headlight behinds us. I can see it. It\'s real bright.'\xa0 Afterthe train had gotten hung up and had stopped on Belknap Hill, they gotout and looked around. The conductor, after backing the train down thehill, got out, walked down to the rear unit and pressed the restart button.To his surprise the unit 'kicked right off, ran real good'. The light orthe object was now moving off, back from where it had come from. Accordingto the conductor, whatever had given them a 'red board', now was givingthem a 'green board'. As he, himself, stated, 'The board went green. Thelight cleared up the board'. The train, previously hampered with a badrear unit and way over-tonnage, was now fully able to climb the steep,hill and made it in to Howell without further mishap!\xa0What makes this case interesting is in this detailed report (this isonly a synopsis) something very bright was first seen, then a similar brightlight follows a train, a diesal. Tractors and other diesals have been virtuallyunaffected by UFOs. The Blocking System reacts as the object approachesand recedes, just as if there was a train on that track. The train, originallydisabled (and reportedly with a 'dead' rear unit) now works fine even withover-tonnage when the UFO is out of the picture. All this during a massivesighting wave with some of the best close encounters we ever recorded!And that\'s not all. The crew was reprimanded for filing a report. Laterwe found that the engine had been pulled and taken down south to be studiedand reportedly the U.S.Air Force was involved.\xa0Source:http://www.nicap.dabsol.co.uk/book.htmWritten by Francis Ridge, then Director of the UFO Filter Center& MADAR Project.'

1982,'Reader Recounts 1982 Encounter in Maine 1982-Eliot, MaineIt was the summer of 1982. I was 14, living in Eliott, Maine - a small town across the river from Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Our house was empty, as we were moving to Alaska that week, and the movers had already taken our belongings.  It was dusk, and I was upstairs in my room, laying in my sleeping bag, listening to the radio, looking out of the window that no longer had curtains. Suddenly I saw a black, geometric object zig-zagging rapidly in the air above the tree line of the woods behind my house. Its distance away from me was about 1.5 football field lengths.  Its motion reminded me of an air hockey puck, with seemingly instantaneous changes in direction. It was zig-zagging, but traveling in my general direction.  At this distance, the general shape of the object seemed to resemble a coffin - oriented flat with respect to the ground, with the wider end towards the direction of travel, which was towards me.  But it was hard to tell because of the distance away and the object's speed.  The object kept its height in the air constant, about 5 to 10 feet above the trees.  I got up and kneeled at the window to get a better look, but could no longer see it.  The way it moved made the sight seem unreal, and I stayed kneeling by the window for a few minutes to try to see the object again, but did not.  I could not comprehend what I had seen.  As I started to look away from the window to go back to laying down, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed the object hovering above my back yard, about 30 to 40 feet away from my window, at about the same height in the air as my window on the second story of the house.  It was perfectly still, and perfectly silent, and it wasn't there a second ago.  It looked like it was made of metal, but was a dull gun-metal black, with no windows, lights, doors or seams of any kind, but it did have a few small protrusions which looked like instrumentation - giving me the impression the object was some sort of machinery.  It was the approximate size of an automobile.  The shape was a trapezoid - a square or rectangle 'front' and a larger square or rectangle in the back, so the craft tapered from the back to the front.  It was like a pyramid tipped over on its side with the pointed portion removed.  Or maybe a better way to describe it is as a blunted wedge.  This shape seemed different from the way it appeared when it was zig-zagging above the trees, but I might have been mistaken of its shape when it was above the trees, since that was at some distance away, and moving rapidly.  I had absolutely no fear of the object - only curiosity as to what it was I was looking at.  I got to look at it for about 4 seconds, then it left in an instant.  It left so fast, that I could just barely tell that it left in a direction, rather than just disappearing.  The object left in the opposite direction it came from.  And though the craft seemed to have a front and a back, it did not turn around before reversing its direction.When the song on the radio ended, the DJ came on saying that he was getting inundated with calls about some object seen in the air.  I called the radio station as well, and told the DJ that I too had seen the object, but that was as much as I told him.I still, to this day, have never heard any other UFO report describing a craft shaped like this.  My whole life, I rarely thought about this experience.  Not until recently, when I saw a show on UFOs describing the same flight characteristic, did I really start to think about my experience, and realize that what I saw was a UFO.  I am an engineer now, and so understand that this craft displayed flight characteristics which defy our understanding of physics.  It had no wings or control surfaces of any sort, and was entirely silent.  It didn't need to move to stay aloft.  It seemed unaffected by gravity or inertia.  It had the ability to change speed and direction instantaneously - including the ability to hover perfectly still.  Supposedly, there were a lot of people who saw this craft that night.  So, maybe there are records of it somewhere.  It was a mainstream, pop radio station that I was listening to.

There was something 'unexplained' going on in this place only an hour\'s drive north of New York City. The Hudson Valley UFO saga began at almost the beginning of a new year, 1982. Just a short time before midnight, December 31, 1981, a retired policeman was sitting in his backyard in Kent, N. Y. He saw a group of strange lights to the south. The lights were a brilliant red, green, and white, and at first, he thought they could be coming from an airplane in trouble. It was common for him to sit and watch the bigjets fly over at night. As the lights became closer, his opinion quickly changed. The lights were moving too slowly to be a plane, and now... they were too low, and there was no noise from an engine. What was the strange craft he was seeing?As the lights came closer, he could hear a  humming sound, and now he could see that the lights were arranged in a triangular shape, and there was a solid object of some kind connecting the lights. No, this was no aircraft he had ever seen before! The solid part looked like...a fuselage. That\'s what it was...a fuselage. He was looking at a UFO. This type of report would be repeated many times in the Hudson Valley over the next few years. All of them were similar, a V-shaped row of lights connected by a solid object of some type. Literally hundreds of witnesses would see this same sight. There was definitely something unusual going on in the skies over the Hudson Valley. Something that moved ever so slowly, so silently.On March 26, 1983, an article about the sightings appeared on the front page of the Westchester-Rockland Daily Item. The article recounted the many reports of the strange phenomena. The cat was out of the bag. The press coverage drew the attention of a group of UFO investigators who were associated with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, acclaimed scientist and UFO investigator. A thorough investigation followed, and ultimately a book, 'Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings.' The group began their inquiries by setting up a phone hotline. They received over 300 calls from individuals who had seen the strange V-shaped lights on the night of March 24, 1983 alone. Descriptions were very similar, if not identical. The object always moved slowly, and almost silently. It always had many lights, and they were always in a V-configuration. Some of the witnesses got a close enough look to say that the craft was large enough to be a 'flying city.'On the same night, the city of Yorktown also came alive with reports of this giant flying craft. The police switchboard was jammed with so many calls about the UFO that they feared not being able to respond to 'real emergencies.' Drivers pulled over on the Taconic parkway to watch the large object slowly make it\'s way across the skies. All in all, about 5,000 reports were made during a period of five years, from 1982 through 1986. The object was seen by multiple witnesses at night, never daylight. The sightings ranged as far east as New Haven, Connecticut, and as far north as Brookfield, Connecticut. Several theories were put forth about whether there was only one object, or many. Some additional accounts would come forward stating that the object, though moving slowly, would at times make a rapid, fast maneuver from one location to another. Also the lights of the craft could change colors in an instant.A report made from guards at the Indian Point Nuclear Plant would be one of the most dramatic. The gigantic UFO was seen hovering over the plant for periods of time, and moved as close as 30 feet from the reactor. Security supervisors even once considered ordering in planes to have it shot down. The object over Indian Point was described by some of the guards as 1,000 ft. long. Another witness described the object hovering over the Croton Falls Reservoir, using a red beam as it seemed to scan the surface of the water.Reasonable explanations for the sightings were offered. Skeptics suggested that planes, balloons, satellites, and even the planet Venus could explain away the accounts. Considering all of the information available, researchers could find only one object that could mimic the movements of the UFO, a blimp. All blimp manufacturers and pilots were contacted, and not one case of a blimp over the area on the nights of the sightings could be found. The Hudson Valley sightings are still a mystery today.(B J Booth)', '1982 - UFO Hovers over Nancy, France GardenFair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

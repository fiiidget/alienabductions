1969,'1969-Brazil; Abduction of José Antonio da SilvaThe following abduction occurred at Bebedouro, Minas Gerais, Brazil, in the afternoon of 4 May, 1969. 24-year-old José Antonio da Silva, an enlisted soldier, was fishing on a lagoon when suddenly he heard voices, became aware of figures moving behind him, and felt a burst of light strike his leg. He dropped his fishing rod and fell to his knees. Two beings, about four feet tall, wearing aluminumlike suits and what appeared to be helmets, seized him and dragged him to an object sitting on a dirt road. The object was shaped like an upright cylinder and had black platforms at each end. The soldier was taken inside, where the beings put one of their 'helmets' on him...Da Silva felt the craft rise. The beings talked animatedly among themselves in a language he did not recognize. After a long period of travel, he felt a jarring that suggested their craft had landed. The soldier was then blindfolded and led to a large room, where they removed the wrap from his eyes.A being stood in front of him who was extremely hairy and slightly taller than the rest. His waist-long hair was reddish and wavy.When the others took off their helmets, they were of similar appearance.Da Silva watched as the beings, at one point more than a dozen, examined his fishing equipment and took one of every item he had in duplicate. Later the witness noticed on a low shelf the bodies of four human men, one black, and became terribly frightened. Later still, the beings gave him a dark green liquid to drink out of a cubical stone glass.The dwarf leader then began a strange conservation with the soldier, mostly about weapons, which was conducted entirely with gestures and drawings. Da Silva also understood that they wanted him to help in their relations with humans. When the soldier refused, the dwarf snatched the crucifix from the rosary Da Silva always carried with him. As the soldier began praying, a Cristlike figure appeared to him, making revelations. Shortly afterwards, Da Silva was blindfolded again and taken back to earth. As the craft landed, he felt he was being dragged and lost consciousness. He woke up alone near the town of Vitoria, about 200 miles from where he had been fishing. He was dehydrated and hungry, but drank from a stream and was able to catch some fish as he still had his rod with him. Only his identity card, which the aliens had examined, had disappeared. He had a swollen knee where the ray had struck him and three open wounds on his neck where the helmet had rubbed against his skin. He had been away four and a half days. One of the central questions in this case is how Da Silva travelled the 200 miles from Bebedouro to Vitoria, and where his physical body was during his 4.5-day absence. If there had been witnesses and video equipment at both locations would they have observed him being taken aboard a craft, the craft taking off, the landing of the craft at the other location, and his emergence from it? Most of the abduction could easily be a vision. Jacques Vallee points out the striking parallels between the man's experience and initiation ordeals. Initiation rituals are characterized by the following general scenes: the candidate is confronted by members of the occult group wearing a special costume; he is blindfolded; he is led by the arm along a rough and difficult route; he is taken into a specially designed chamber with no windows; he is brought into the presence of a 'master'; he is given a test and made to answer questions; he is shown a variety of symbols designed to remind him of death; the situation suggests he may not survive the ordeal; he is given ritual food or drink; he is blindfolded again and led outside. All these elements are present in the case of Antonio da Silva.source:http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/dp5/ufo4.htm', '1969-Brazil; Abduction of José Antonio da SilvaThe following abduction occurred at Bebedouro, Minas Gerais, Brazil, in the afternoon of 4 May, 1969. 24-year-old José Antonio da Silva, an enlisted soldier, was fishing on a lagoon when suddenly he heard voices, became aware of figures moving behind him, and felt a burst of light strike his leg.

The craft was seen by the entire crew of the Oil Tanker 'British Grenadier' for exactly 3 days!The event occurred around April/May 1969 while the 'British Grenadier' was sailing through the Gulf of Mexico. The UFO appeared directly above the ship at exactly noon on the first day. It just seemed to appear as nobody saw it arrive and it remained above the ship for the next 3 days. According to reports the craft was approximately 1 mile above the ship and dark blue in colour during the day. At night it appeared as a silvery light. The weather conditions were good at the time, with a clear sky and calm seas.On the first day of its arrival (one minute after midnight), the ships engines suddenly stopped and only emergency lighting and steering were available. The crew managed to restart the engines, which took some time as all the pumps had to be shut down and restarted manually.The second day saw all the food storage refridgerators closed down and no reason for this event could be found.On the third day at 11.45 pm one of the crew noticed that the lights were out in the ships air conditioning room and a door leading to the crews accomodation was opened. The engineer passed through the door to investigate and spoke to two firemen. But the next day the same door was found welded shut! Apparently, the door had been welded before the ship left dock (because of a fault), but the door was definitely open for the engineer to have walked through it.A few minutes after this event the engines stopped again, leaving just emergency lighting and steering (again one minute after midnight!). They were restarted once more, but later it was discovered that the starter motor for the emergency diesel generator had been dismantled. All the parts of the generator were neatly placed by the machine as if someone had examined it.At exactly noon on the third day the craft vanished in the same manner as it had appeared.Although all these events were recorded in the ships log, this is the first time (to our knowledge) that this event has been published. We would be interested in hearing from any of the crew that were aboard the BP Oil Tanker 'British Grenadier' at this time, in order to obtain more information about this sighting.

I am not sure of the dates, but it is close, J. K. he worked for me, and I went to the mine (Midway Mining Co) I owned this fluorite, zinc and lead mine. It was about 1969 in the fall, J. K. and I went down to the mine to get some pump parts to build a new pump. It was about 8 AM. We loaded up some parts and went to the machine shop at Frances, KY. about 13 miles from the mine. The machinist, J. K and I worked on the pump until about 9 PM. We had some old parts so we returned them to the mine.  I had a shop there then.The mine covered about 2 acres. It was cleared off with some gravel in the lot: there were 2 buildings and a head frame and some mining equipment on the yard and a grassy field all around the mine. One tree behind us, when we pulled into the mine we saw what looked like this new barn in front of us. It looked like a new metal building.  J. K. and I talked about it. I pulled the truck up so we could see it better. We were within 80 ft. of it. It looked like a 80 ft. high 80 ft. long and 80 ft. wide. It was as plain as it could be that we were looking at a new building that had been put up.  The farmer that owned the land was Doey Binkley. He did not like me mining on his property as he did not own the mineral under his farm, the minerals had been sold to a Mr. Martin in 1907. Doey bought the farm after I was mining. My mining lease forbade me from mining under a existing house,  barn, etc,  so J. K. and I were talking that the next day I would talk to a lawyer and get this building tore down. We probably talked about the building for 10 to 20 minutes all the time we were just looking at the building in amazement at how fast they had put it up.Then we saw a light like a hand held light coming from the back to the side of the building. I said Doey is here and I will talk to him now. We got out of the truck, and walked to the front of the truck,  and the building just went away: no sound,  not anything: it just went away.It was clear; not very cold,  no fog,  no other lights,  no water. It was just like a building sitting on the grass and then it went away. According to the eye witnesses, what appeared to be a building, was really an unknown object with the ability to either disappear, or quickly fly away. Could it have gone into another dimension right before their eyes, or simply vanished?W. L. D.source and references:Eye witness report, W. L. D.', 'The Secret KGB UFO Files, The Russian Crash of 1969The details of a Russian Crash on or about 1969 are sketchy and somewhat suspect. This case comes from the so-called 'Secret KGB Files,' which were reportedly smuggled out of the former Soviet Union.  Reportedly, $10,000 was paid for the information. The details of these secret files were first offered to the general public on 9-13-98 as part of a TNT special titled 'The Secret UFO Files of the KGB.' The show featured extraordinary film and still photographs of the UFO recovery, and also a portion of autopsy film on part of an alien body.The event itself, according to the files, occurred in the state of Sverdlovsky, which was formerly Yekatrinburg of the USSR. The crash story follows a familiar pattern normally associated with this type of report.  The fiery crash of an unknown object occurred in March 1969. The site was secured by the Russian military, and one dead alien was found in the wreckage. The remains of the craft and alien were brought to a secure location, and the alien body was autopsied. Both still and moving pictures were taken of the craft, its retrieval, and the alien autopsy. The autopsy shows only an alien torso and arm. From the size of the body parts, the alien would have been an extremely small being.The TNT special features Roger Moore, veteran actor and former James Bond, who discusses other UFO events, along with interviews with UFO experts, CIA agents, and other film. Probably the most notable footage is from MIG gun cameras of confrontations with UFOs. There have been only a few still frames of this footage in America, and I have not been able as of this writing, 11-01-2002, to obtain the videos. The show itself is mediocre, and its only redeeming quality is the presentation of the UFO crash story. Supposedly, the crash story was validated by secret KGB documents.The footage at the crash site does seem to be authentic at least on several points. The truck in the film is a circa 1950 model ZIS151, which has not been used by the military for quite some time, and the truck would have been difficult to find to stage a hoax with. Other elements of the film do not exhibit any obvious signs of a hoax, as to the movement of the soldiers, the timing of the film as to shadows, and the UFO itself.There are also several documents shown to verify the event itself, and an eyewitness to the event who swears that the recovery mission did occur. The footage of the autopsy film shows personnel without caps and gowns, which seemed odd to me at first, but after some research I found that this was commonplace for that era in Russia.The furnishings in the room are acceptable, and in Russia have probably not changed much today. Three men in their 20\'s and 30\'s are performing the procedure, and one woman is taking notes. The note taker is identified as KGB stenographer O. A. Pshonikina. The alien\'s torso and arm are lying together on the table as the autopsy is performed, and there are documents shown to support the autopsy.Although the USA-Russia relationship is much improved over a few years ago, it still lacks. Any information received is subject to translation, and often times there are problems with interpretation. It is sad there is not more cooperation between the two countries. The case of the 1969 retrieval and autopsy are difficult to assess. Until more information is uncovered, it will remain unsubstantiated.'

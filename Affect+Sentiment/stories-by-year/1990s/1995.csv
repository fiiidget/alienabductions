1995,'1995 - The American West UFO SightingA west bound America West B-757 airliner encountered a UFO with flashing lights along its length on May 25, 1995. The passenger jet was flying over the panhandle of Texas when it observed the unknown object.Thanks be to investigator Walter N. Webb, of the UFO Research Coalition for his thorough investigation of the case. Webb was able to get copies of the FAA voice tapes of chatter between the plane and ground. He also interviewed the crew and air traffic controllers.The plane was designated as America West Flight 564, and was at 39,000 feet near Bovina, Texas, when First Officer John J. Waller and a flight attendant observed a row of white lights which flashed from left to right.The lights were below their flying altitude. Waller immediately made radio contact with the Albuquerque FAA FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center during the observation. Nothing could be found that should be flying in that space at that time.The B-757 continued its course, and the lights began to fall behind it. A group of dark thunderclouds formed, and enabled the UFO to be seen as a cigar-shaped object as its lights illuminated the back drop of the thunderclouds.Waller and his co-pilot estimated the object\'s length at 300-400 feet. The object was not visible on FAA radar, but one of the controllers contacted the North American Air Defense Command, and was told they NORAD was tracking an unidentified object. But, this object later turned out to be a small plane with a non-functioning transponder.The next day, the controller made another check with NORAD, and he was told that they had indeed tracked another unknown target the night before that was at first stationary, but then accelerated and stopped again very rapidly. These quick darts were estimated at somewhere between 1,000 and 1,400 mph.When reports of the incident began to be leaked, Webb began to investigate. In addition to interviewing the airliner\'s crew, he also obtained the tapes of the conversation between FAA air traffic controllers and their contacts during the sighting. He was able to make drawings of the UFO.He also filed Freedom of Information Act requests, and searched military installations to see if any activity that night could account for the sighting. There was nothing that could explain the sighting of America West Flight 564, and until another explanation can be found for the unusual object, we can assume that a UFO was seen that night.This is a transcription of the communication between the crew of the America West flight and the Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control center. It also includes several conversations between the Albuquerque ARTC and other locations, including NORAD, that were contacted in an effort try to identify the object.There are three terms used in the following conversations that there are no explanations for: TIEBAND, BIGFOOT, and HIGH-BALLS. The term \'tieband\' is spelled phonetically, but any help with them would be appreciated. The recordings of the ARTC communications obviously include conversations with other aircraft and locations that do not pertain to the object reported by the America West flight.9:21pm...AW-564: 'Cactus 564 going direct crow, crow 6 arrival Las Vegas.'ABQ: 'Cactus 564...Albuquerque Center...good evening'AW-564: '564 at 39,000\''9:29pm...AW-564: 'Cactus 564...off to our 3:00, got some strobes out there.Could you tell us what it is?'ABQ: 'Uh, Uh..I\'ll tell you what, that\'s some, uh..right now...I don\'t know what it is right now.

And it\'suh...there\'s a strobe that starts..um, going on counter-clockwise, and uh...the length is unbelievable.'(???): 'Where\'s this?'(NOTE: The last question above cannot be readily identified as having comefrom the Albuquerque FAA controller. Perhaps it was, however since a conversationwith Cannon AFB began just at this point it could well indicate that the conversationwas being monitored. The very next statement heard is the Albuquerque FAAcontroller calling to Cannon AFB.)9:31pm...ABQ: 'Cannon 121?'CANNON: 'Cannon..go ahead'ABQ: 'Do you guys know if there was anything like a tetheredballoon released that should be above \'tieband\'?'CANNON: 'Uh, no, we haven\'t heard nothin\' about it.'(BOTH)' 'Uh, ok..(some chuckling), uh, ha..'ABQ: 'A guy at 39,000 says he sees something at 30,000 that\'s as,..the length is unbelievable and it has a strobe on it.'CANNON: 'Uh huh...?'ABQ: 'This is NOT good..(laughing)..okay...'CANNON: 'Uh, wha..what does that mean?:ABQ: '(laughing)..I don\'t know, it\'s a ufo or something, it\'s thatRoswell crap again!'CANNON: 'Where\'s it at now?'ABQ: 'He says it\'s right in \'tieband\'.'CANNON: 'It\'s right in \'tieband\'?'ABQ: 'Yeah!'CANNON: 'No, we haven\'t seen nothin\' like that.'ABQ: 'Okay, keep your eyes open.'CANNON: 'I\'ll talk to you (mumbled).'9:34pm...ABQ: 'Cactus 564...we checked with Cannon and they don\'t haveany, uh, weather balloons or anything up tonight. Nobodyup front knows any idea about that. Do you still see it?'AW-564: 'Negative..back where we initially spotted it it was betweenthe weather and us and when there\'s lightning you couldsee a dark object...and, uh, it was pretty eerie looking.This \'air coptr..(mumbled)\' right here going eastbound...maybe he\'ll see it.'ABQ: 'Okay..'AW-564: 'First time in 15 years I\'ve ever seen anything like this.It\'s probably military in that restricted area.'ABQ: 'Cactus 564..you contact Albuquerque Center 132.8,goodnight.'AW-564: '132.8 contact 564.'Just then it sounds like another person in another aircraft breaks in on the conversation. It is never clear just what type of aircraft this isbut the individual has clearly overheard the recent discussion.9:35pm...ABQ: 'Aircraft calling..try again!'(?): 'Center...uh..got time for a quick question?'ABQ: 'Okay..would the question stand-by one please?......okay..go ahead.'(?): '(mumbled) 781, what was that cactus guy talking about hesaw?'ABQ: 'I, I don\'t know, off your right wing about 15-20 miles.He\'s saying he saw a large object with a strobe that lookedlike it was at 30,000 feet.'(?): 'Ah...it\'s that secret stuff!'9:36pm...AW-564: 'Albuquerque...Cactus 564.'ABQ: 'Cactus 564..go ahead.'AW-564: '(garbled)..that passed us earlier on the right. He\'ll be inthe area in a few minutes, is that correct?'ABQ: 'Yeah, he\'ll be in there in about 3-4 minutes, at 27,000.I\'ll ask him what he sees.'AW-564: '..be at his left-hand side between him and the thunderstorm. Thanks alot, we\'ll just monitor and listen.'ABQ: 'Okay.'AW-564: 'Three of us up here saw it!!'ABQ: 'Okay.'After a minute or so Albuquerque Center starts up a conversationwith another aircraft. Again it is unclear at first what aircraft this is asthere was no identification given and this aircraft does not prefaceit\'s transmissions with any identifier. A bit later a statement is directedto 'Hawk 85' which appears to be the aircraft in question.9:31pm...ABQ: 'I can\'t find...in the next 2-3 minutes. Be looking off yourright side, if you see anything about 30000 feet, we hadone aircraft reporting simething that wasn\'t a weatherballoon or anything. It was a long white looking thing witha strobe on. Let me know if you see anything out there.(?): 'I\'ll be careful..(garbled)'ABQ: 'He said it was about 30,000\'.'(?): '(mumbled) I\'m searching for ET.'9:40pm...ABQ: 'Cactus 564...you still up?'AW-564: 'Affirmative! 564'ABQ: 'That was south of your position?'AW-564: 'It was north..'ABQ: 'Hawk 85, let\'s make it out the left window then.'AW-564: 'Albuquerque, can we get a chance..Cactus 564.'ABQ: 'You know we\'re all up here huddled up talking about it. Whenit lightning\'d you could see the dark object. It was like acigar shape from the altitude that we could see it..and thelength is what go us, a...sort of confused, because itlooked like it was about 300-400 feet long. So I don\'t knowif it\'s a wire with a strobe on it, but the strobe wouldstart from the left and go right, counter-clockwise...andit was a pretty eerie looking site, but a, had the strobe..At this point in the tape copy I received there appeared to havebeen some problem as there was a brief approximately 1/3 secondsolid tone like a dialtone. Then there was a strong transmission likeanother broadcast trying to cut in. The previous conversation continuedbriefly and the tone appears again followed by another request to 'Albuquerque Radio'.9:41pm...(brief but solid strong tone heard)(?): 'ALBQUERQUE RADIO?...ALBUQUERQUE RADIO?'AW-564?: '..and it was just in the lightning...'(?): (solid strong tone heard again)(?) 'ALBUQUERQUE RADIO?'ABQ: 'Yeah...is this one any better?'(?): 'Yeah.'ABQ: 'Oh good! Ha..hey you guys don\'t know anything about somekind of weather balloon or a ufo that\'s out in the vicinityof Fort Sumner tonight do you?'(?) 'I don\'t think so...standby.'ABQ: 'Okay..'(?): 'At this point the answer to that question is \'no\'.'ABQ: 'Okay..yeah, this guy sees it up at Tucumcari, says it lookslike it\'s 300-400 foot long, cylindrical, some kind ofstrobe on it, and everything else.'(?) 'Well...I would call it...I don\'t know what it is..yea.'ABQ: 'Yeah, okay...I didn\'t know if you were a science fictionbuff or anything.'(?) 'Yea..no, we don\'t have, we don\'t have any published 'highballs' today.'ABQ: 'Okay..appreciate it.'(?): 'Mmm hmm...bye.'9:42pm...AW-564: 'Albuquerque, 564...last time...just for our notes we\'regoing to take a message. was that in a restricted area..andthat was just basically south of Tucumcari when we reportedit?'ABQ: 'Okay...the way you went through, the only restricted areawas on your south side, nothing to the north side...andthose restricted areas are inactive. There shouldn\'t beanything going on.'9:44pm...AW-564: 'Albuquerque Center..Cactus 564. Thanks for your help and,uh, could we get your call sign?'ABQ: 'Cactus 564...say again?'AW-564: 'Albuquerque Center..Cactus564..We\'ll talk to you later.Before we go could we get your call-sign?'ABQ: 'Cactus 564...mine is \'PP\'.'AW-564: 'Was that \'tango golf\'?'ABQ: 'Pappa Pappa.'AW-564: 'Pappa Pappa...thanks alot.'(End of Side 1, Tape 1..)9:48pm...ABQ: 'Bigfoot...Albuquerque Sector 87.'BIGFOOT: 'Bigfoot\'s on!'ABQ: 'Yea..I\'ve got a, uh, something unusual and I was wantingto know if you\'all happen to know of anything going onout here around Tucumcari, New Mexico,...north of Cannon?I had a couple of aircraft reported something 300-400 footlong..cylindrical in shape, with a strobe flashing off tothe end of it.'BIGFOOT: 'Oh..?'ABQ: 'At 30,000 feet.'BIGFOOT: 'Okay...hang on a second.'ABQ: 'Yeah, I didn\'t know if you happen to know of anythinggoing on out there...no balloons in the area, no nothingreported?'BIGFOOT: 'Okay, where\'s this at again?'ABQ: 'It\'s at, uh, well ya\'know where...it\'s in Tucumcar, NewMexico, it\'s about 150 miles to the east of Albuquerque.'BIGFOOT: 'Okay, eh...how far from Holloman?'ABQ: 'Eh, Holloman, it looks like it\'s off the zero-three-zeroof Holloman about 220 miles.'BIGFOOT: 'Okay...I think, okay...it\'s kind\'a hard for us to see here.Okay, they\'ll be zero for about 200. Um...we don\'t haveanything going on over there that I know of.'ABQ: 'Yeah...I didn\'t know, we\'ve tried everybody else andnobody else is...this guy definitely saw it run all the waydown the side of the airplane. Said it was a prettyinteresting thing out there.'BIGFOOT: 'Okay, it was at 30,000 feet..'ABQ: '...30,000 feet.'BIGFOOT: 'It was like..long...um..'ABQ: 'Yeah, it\'s right out of, right out of the X-files. I meandefinite UFO or something like that, I mean.'BIGFOOT: '..and..it..ooohh..ya\'ll are serious about this (laughing).'ABQ: 'Yeah, he\'s real serious about that to, and..uh..he lookedat, saw it, no balloons are reported tonight, nothing inthe area...'BIGFOOT: 'It was strobing off the front he said?'ABQ: 'Uh...I think the strobe was off the tail end of it.'BIGFOOT: 'Okay...strobe tail end.'ABQ: 'He said it was kinda, well it was dark but..(aside tosomeone else)..did he say there was lights in it?'BIGFOOT: 'How long did he say it was?'ABQ: 'He said it was 300-400 foot long.'BIGFOOT: 'Holy smoke!!'ABQ: '..and we don\'t have any air carriers out here so...thatstrobing along.'BIGFOOT: 'um..the only thing that I can do is , I wonder if any ofour aerostats cut loose or something \'cause we don\'thave any aerostats there.'ABQ: 'Yeah...not that far to the north.'BIGFOOT: 'I mean...to me it would sound like an aerostat, but..Idon\'t think ours are that big though.'', 'UFO / Airplane Near Miss, Manchester Airport, U K 1995PART A: SUMMARY OF INFORMATION TO JASTHE B737 PILOT reports that he was over the Pennines, about 8 or 9 NM SE of Manchester Airport, at 4000ft, while being radar vectored by Manchester radar on 119.4. He was flying at 180-210 kt on a N heading and squaking 5734 with Mode C selected. Although it was dark, visibility was over 10 km with a fairly strong NW wind (340/30). While flying just above the tops of some rugged Cu both he and the first officer saw a lighted (see JAS notes) object fly down the RH side of the ac at a high speed from the opposite direction. He was able to track the object through the RH windscreen and side window, having it is sight for a total of about 2 seconds. There was no apparent sound or wake. The first officer instinctively 'ducked' as it went by.The first officer reports that his attention, initially focused on the glare shield in front of him, was diverted to something in his peripheral vision. He looked up in time to see a dark object pass down the right hand side of the ac at high speed; it was wedge-shaped with what could have been a black stripe down the side. he estimated the object's size as somewhere between that of a light ac and a Jetstream, though he emphasised that this was pure speculation. it made no attempt to deviate from its course and no sound was heard or wake felt. He felt certain that what he saw was a solid object - not a bird, balloon or kite.MANCHESTER ATC reports that the B737 was being radar vectored from Dayne to the ILS for RW 24 when the pilot reported a lighted object passing close by above and in the opposite direction. There was no known traffic in the vicinity at the time and no radar contacts were seen.JAS Note (1): Telephone conversations subsequently took place with both the captain and his first officer. the captain remained convinced that the object was itself lit. Although he could not determine a definite pattern, he described it has having a number of small white lights, rather like a Christmas tree. He confirmed the high speed of the object, and though unable to estimate the distance, said he felt it was very close. Following the incident, the captain and first officer independently drew what they had seen, both agreed about the shape but differing in their opinions about the lighting aspects. The first officer felt that the object was illuminated by their landing lights, which at that stage were switched on. He was unable to assess the distance, other than to say that he involuntarily 'ducked', so it must have appeared to him to have been very close. He was entirely convinced, as was the captain, that they had seen a solid object and not a Met phenomenon, balloon or any other craft with which they were familiar, or a Stealth ac, which he [the captain had himself had seen and which he feels he would have recognised.JAS Note (2): Despite exhaustive investigations the reported object remains untraced. A reply of the Ciee radar shows a number of secondary contacts, including the subject B737, being radar sequenced in the Manchester TMA and zone. The B737 tracks over two almost stationary primary contacts just N of Leek on a NW heading while descending through FL 70-60. On entering the Manchester TMA, passing FL 50, it is vectored right onto about 040 deg, and continues to descend on a NE track along the E boundary of the Manchester TMA to within 0.75NM of the Daventry CTA, where the base of CAS is FL 45. At this point, passing 3600 Mode C, the ac is turned onto a L base for RW 24 as part of a busy sequence of inbound ac. At no time during the downwind leg is any other radar contact seen in the vicinity. An extract from the RT recording on 119.4, which shows that the B737 was given decent clearance to 4000 ft at 1845:30, follows: From:B737 (1848) - 'c/s we just had something go down the RHS just above us very fast.' Manchester - 'Well, there's nothing seen on radar. Was it er an ac?' B737 - 'Well, it had lights, it went down the starboard side very quick.' Manchester - 'And above you?' B737 - 'er, just slightly above us, year.' Manchester - 'Keep an eye out for something, er, I can't see anything at all at the moment so, er, must have, er, been very fast or gone down very quickly after it passed you I think.' B737 - 'OK. Well, there you go!' The possibility that the object might have been a hang glider, paraglider or microlight was investigated, but all the operating authorities, without exception, agreed that this was an extremely unlikely explanation, for various reasons, but mainly because none of these activities takes place at night. In addition, there are obvious hazards of flying in the dark, from high ground (the peaks in this area along the Pennine ridge range from 1600 to over 2000 ft), string winds, and because these aircraft are unlit. JAS also explored the possibility of military activity, but could find no evidence in support of this from any official source. In any case, it seems most unlikely that such a flight would have been conducted in CAS and so close to a busy international airport. Because of the B737's proximity to the uncontrolled airspace to the E of Manchester, during the downwind leg, which covers the airmiss period, the possibility of unknown military or civil activity in the adjacent FIR cannot be completely discounted. However, the likelihood of such activity escaping detection is remote, as the area is well served by several radars and any movements a the levels in question would almost certainly have generated a radar response.PART B: SUMMARY OF THE WORKING GROUP'S DISCUSSIONSInformation available to the Working Group included reports from the pilot of the B737, transcripts of the relevant RT frequencies, a video recording, and reports from the air traffic controllers involved.The Group were anxious to emphasise that this report, submitted by two responsible airline pilots, was considered seriously and they wished to commend the pilots for their courage in submitting it, and their company, whose enlightened attitude made it possible. Reports such as these are often the object of derision, but the Group hopes that this example will encourage pilots who experience unusual sightings to report them without fear of ridicule. It was quickly realised by all members that, because of its unusual nature, they could only theorise on the possibilities once normal avenues of investigation had been explored. There is no doubt that the pilots both saw an object and that it was of sufficient significance to prompt an airmiss report. Unfortunately, the nature and identity of this object remains unknown. To speculate about extra-terrestrial activity, fascinating though it may be, is not within the Group's remit and must be left to those whose interest lies in that field. It is probably true to say, however, that almost all unusual sightings can be attributed to a wide range of well known natural phenomena. there are, of course, a few which defy explanation and thus fuel the imagination of those who are convinced that there is 'something going on' out there. Usually activity of this kind is accompanied by a rash of ground sightings in the same geographic area; in this case, as far as is known, there were no other reports and therefore the incident has to be viewed in isolation, with no other witnesses. The resources normally available when investigating airmisses are pilots' reports, corroborated by radar and RT recordings. Often these will provide all the clues necessary, but in this case there is no 'reported pilot', and radar recordings do not show any unknown contacts. The lack of a radar contact is not necessarily unusual if weather suppressors are in use on radar, particularly if the object generates a poor radar response. In these conditions the radar an interpret a non-transponding (primary) contact as weather, and therefore disregards it. Enquiries into military activity did not reveal any ac in the area at the time, and it was considered inconceivable that such activity would take place so close to a busy airport without some sort of prior notification. members put forward other suggestions, such as large model aircraft or commercially operated remotely controlled craft, such as those which are used for survey or photographic work. Considering the prevailing conditions - darkness, high ground, strong NW wind and the proximity of a major international airport - the Group felt that this kind of activity, together with the hang glider/microlight theory, could not be regarded as a realistic possibility. As was pointed out by one member, however, the extreme actions of a foolhardy individual cannot be entirely ruled out and there remains, therefore, the possibility that someone, perhaps in a microlight ac (which most accurately fits the shape described ), had defied the conditions and got airborne. Further talks with the microlight experts on this idea highlighted the extreme improbability; the strong wind, terrain and darkness would have rendered such a flight almost suicidal.Having debated the various hypotheses at length the Group concluded that, in the absence of any firm evidence which could identify or explain this object, it was not possible to assess either the cause or the risk to any of the normal criteria applicable to airmiss reports. The incident therefore remains unresolved.source and references:http://maxpages.com/mapit/CAA_REPORT_ON_NEAR_AIR_MISS\t', 'Multiple Sightings-Central Coast, New South Wales, 1995-96Multiple Sightings-Central Coast, New South Wales, 1995-96During the period from December 1995 to January 1996, a spate of UFO sightings        had locals from the Central Coast area in New South Wales quite baffled.

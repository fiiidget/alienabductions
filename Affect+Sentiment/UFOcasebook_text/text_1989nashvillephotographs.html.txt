The 1989 Nashville, Tennessee Photographs




Inside the outer perimeter lights are panels of lights. These also appear to 
have the ability to change color. Although they are predominantly white they 
are sometimes seen as partially red or black. 

Assuming the craft is 100 feet in diameter these outer panels take up about 
40 feet or 20 feet on each side.
 
Below the center of craft there appears to be a crystal or lights with 
crystal like appearance. Generally these lights appear blue. craft appears 
to rotate in the photos. Graham gave me his word that these were authentic 
photographs of an actual flying craft to the best knowledge. 

He has known the photographer for 24 years and the man worked for him 
for ten years. He has always been know to tell the truth and was of high character.

Editor's Note: I have observed a UFO at close distance. The colors of the smoke 
probably are a coronal discharge similar to what I saw.
 
The lights themselves have an unusual depth of color. When you look at a colored
light it is normally a white light covered by a lens of red, yellow, green, blue etc. 
The lights on the craft appear as if the light contain the actual color. There is a 
vividness of color that is difficult to describe that appears to be in these photos.
 
The fog or plasma is penetrated by the powerful lights shining downward. 
The lights extend down for an estimated seventy-five feet to one hundred plus
feet and seem to stop abruptly. Duplication of this capability is exceptionally 
difficult to accomplish with any normal lights. 

I have never seen lights that have these properties except on a UFO, nor 
have I seen comparable photography.
 
I have over 5000 hours flying time and taken thousands of photographs. 
I would be very interested in any similar photographs or videos of a comparable craft.

Sheriff Blinded by Light from UFO; Minnesota-1979

We were contacted by researcher Guy Westcott, of UFOR, who investigated the Val Johnson case. He worked for NOAP and CCUFOS at the time of the incident, and has been kind enough to send us some great material pertaining to the case, and we offer him much thanks for this. All of the material below came from him.

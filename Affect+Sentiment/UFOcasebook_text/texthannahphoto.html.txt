 1968, Hanbury, England, November 20

Animal Reaction Feature:
Between 5:30 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. (dusk), the Milakovics and their son were driving through an area with fields on both sides of the road. They noticed first one rabbit and then several more scurry across the road from left to right. Looking left, they saw a brilliant object in the field to the left.  
Joan Woodward, Animal Reaction Specialist:
The Milakovics stopped their car and got out as the object rose slowly and flew over their car.  Doris Milakovic noticed the air temperature felt warmer as the object flew over head.  The object continued flying over the field to their right and hovered over a house about 100 yards away, where it quivered “like a jelly.”  It appeared as wide as the house.
The drawing of the object shows a dark bowl-shaped bottom, with a clear dome on top. The dome was divided into vertical thirds, one third showing white light, one third, amber light, and the final third, green light.

In the lit dome area, several humanoid figures were seen moving, sometimes appearing to bend down as though looking at something below the rim (see sketch).

The object began moving in a jerky manner, its light become much more intense and Mr. Milakovic felt his eyes burning.  Now frightened, they got in their car and sped away.

No sound or EM effects were reported.  Two physiological effects were reported:  heat felt as object passed over and burning of the eyes when its light intensity increased.

2009 - Slovakian Police Capture UFOs on Camera
Voronezh residents interviewed later claimed they had observed this UFO not just during the above incident but also many times on September 21, 23, 29 and October 2, between 6 and 9 PM.  Some of these incidents involved a different entity: small, with grayish-green face and blue overcoat resembling a loose raincoat.

This phenomenal account is still in need of more eyewitness testimony and research. The 
Voronezh landing remains an unsolved mystery.

The  1976 Stanford, Kentucky Abductions (1) 

The first meeting was more or less an ice-breaking session, but several very important facts were revealed. Black stated that the three women were all obviously in physical pain, they all were chain-smoking, which they attributed to the experience. They had an insatiable thirst, and all claimed excessive weight loss since the event. The three women gave some details of their observations of the UFO; its structure, and its behavior. They also discussed some of the ill effects that they had sustained. These memories were painful to all three, as they tried to recall details in hopes that someone might be able to help them. Mrs. Thomas would state, "We live in fear of what we don't know. I'm worried about Lou and Mona. I think they're ready for a breakdown."

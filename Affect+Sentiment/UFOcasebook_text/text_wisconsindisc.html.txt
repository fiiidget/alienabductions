Wisconsin - Disc With Lights Photographed, 2003

February 2003 - Wisconsin - Disc With Lights Photographed Above Trees 
  
My son and I were visiting a friend of mine in Weyauwega. I am reluctant to reveal the exact location out of concern for my friend's privacy as well as my own. However the general location is just North of Main street on the East side of 110 and South of the train tracks. My boy was sledding in the snow and I was taking pictures. 
  

  
  
It was in the evening and was starting to get dark pretty quickly. My son pointed up to the sky and we noticed some lights coming in from what I believe is the south west. At that point I just pointed the camera up and took the shots. The object really gave me the impression of a balloon - except for the lights. They seemed to cycle all different patterns. The object passed almost directly overhead (picture 1) and then headed south towards the train tracks (picture 2). As the object passed I could make out more of a disk shape than a balloon shape. I just remember my son asking me over and over what it was and I didn't have a clue.

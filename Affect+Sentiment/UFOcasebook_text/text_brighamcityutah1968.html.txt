Brigham City, Utah, UFO on Ground, 1968

Mrs. L. P. Cragin of Brigham City, Utah, reported to NICAP that she and her daughter observed an unidentified object on the ground for eight minutes May 7, 1968. 

In mid-afternoon, Mrs. Cragin saw a shiny object to the west of the city near an area known as the Promontory. Studying it through binoculars, she saw that it was hemispherical in shape (dome-like) with four protrusions like legs on the underside. 

Mrs. Cragin got in her car and drove toward the object to get a closer look, but when she reached the edge of town the object was gone. Immediately afterwards, she noticed many types of aircraft, presumably from nearby Hill Field, scouring the area.

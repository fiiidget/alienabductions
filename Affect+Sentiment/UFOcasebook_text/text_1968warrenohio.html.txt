July 8, 1968-Plane Paced by UFO, Warren, Ohio


 On July 8, the pilot and passengers of a Cessna 172 Skyhawk were approached by a UFO over Warren, Ohio about 10:20 p.m. Two brothers, Richard and Ken Montgomery, with Elizabeth Soverns and Rosalind Rians as passengers, were flying at about 4,000 feet over Warren; Richard Montgomery was at the controls. 

"I noticed an object coming toward us from the direction of Youngstown to the southeast," he related. "I swung over... to get a closer look when the object headed directly toward our airplane. It stopped and hung motionless in the air... momentarily, and as our aircraft came closer, it moved swiftly upward and came back at us from another angle." 

Montgomery said the UFO appeared metallic and had a light beaming from its underside. He estimated it was from six to ten feet in diameter and from 16 to 20 feet tall. 

The pilot maneuvered the plane several times, but the object kept following at a distance of from 150 to 200 yards. Then the UFO "suddenly sped in an easterly direction at amazing speed and was quickly out of sight." 

During this encounter, control tower operators at Youngstown Municipal Airport received calls from area residents concerning "a dogfight between two aircraft in the skies over Warren."

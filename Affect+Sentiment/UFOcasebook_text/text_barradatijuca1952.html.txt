Barra da Tijuca, Brazil Photos, May 7, 1952 

Skeptics contend that in photo # 4 (see above) the shadows on the foliage indicate lighting from the right, while the light on the object seems to come from the left. Jim Lorenzen, director of APRO, disputes this finding by stating: "To shine from the right, the Sun would have to shine from the southwest quadrant of the sky- a thing that it never does in that part of Brazil. Moreover, the growth on the hillside is complex; and generally no clear object-and-shadow pattern exists." 

The inconsistency of shadows was first noted in the literature by Donald Menzel and Lyle Boyd in their book The World of Flying Saucers (1963); this finding was endorsed by William K. Hartmann, who later analyzed the photos for the University of Colorado UFO Project. Hartmann stated: "This case is presented as an example of photographs which have been described as incontrovertible evidence of flying saucers, yet which contain a simple and obvious internal inconsistency."

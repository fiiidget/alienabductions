1985,'1985, Bob White UFO Encounter, Grand Junction, COMan finds tough sell for his 'UFO discovery.'  REEDS SPRING, Mo. — Bob White is convinced his story deserves a grand stage, that his most prized possession should be displayed before a national audience. It should draw tourists from all over the country, he figures, and be a major attraction for people who want to see an artifact that White swears was retrieved from a UFO in 1985. Instead, White\'s find is in tiny Reeds Spring in southwestern Missouri, secured in a locked display case at Museum of the Unexplained, a converted video-rental store that, during a recent morning, went more than three hours without a customer. White can\'t figure it out. All he wants to do is find some believers. He wants people to quit snickering and looking at him as if he\'s crazy. He wants them to listen to his story, to take a hard look at his metallic artifact, to give him a chance. 'This,' White said, 'is the most difficult thing I\'ve ever done in my life.' The odds are stacked against him. He and his partner at the museum, Robert Gibbons, have been rejected and ridiculed. White estimates he has spent more than $60,000 traveling to conferences, starting the museum, having the artifact tested and retested. And yet he forges on. 'I\'m 73 years old,' White said. 'I don\'t have much longer. 'What I\'d like to see before I\'m gone is the national media get their heads out of their ... ' White paused, choosing his words carefully, 'out of the sand. I\'d like to see the national media and everybody else realize that what I have is real.' Scientists theorize that the 'UFO' lights that White said he encountered could have been nothing more than a meteorite, that his artifact could be space debris. Some scientists who have tested the object said there was nothing extraterrestrial about it. Ask White whether he believed in unidentified flying objects prior to 1985, and he scrunches up his nose. 'Never,' he said. 'Not a bit. I was the biggest skeptic in the world.' That all changed overnight. Here\'s how he remembers it: White and a friend were driving from Denver to Las Vegas on a desolate highway near the Colorado-Utah border. It was 2 or 3 a.m., he said, and White was sleeping in the passenger seat. At one point, his friend woke him up and pointed out a strange light in the distance. White didn\'t think much of it and went back to sleep. Then his friend woke him up again. This time, White said, the lights were blinding. He got out of the car and stared, dumbfounded. The object was about 100 yards in front of him, he said, 'and it was huge ... absolutely huge.' In time, he said, the lights bolted toward the sky and connected with a pair of neon, tubular lights — 'the mother ship,' White guesses now. And just like that, he said, the entire contraption zipped eastward through the Colorado sky and disappeared. 'What I saw,' White said, 'was not of this Earth.' As the craft flew away, White said, he noticed an orange light falling to the ground. A locator probe? Something that simply broke off? It was red hot when he reached it, he said, but in time it cooled enough to pick up. White shoved the object into the trunk of the car. The object is about 7-1/2 inches long and shaped like a teardrop. It has a coarse, metallic exterior and weighs less than 2 pounds. It looks a bit like it could be a petrified pine cone and is composed primarily of aluminum. White has had the item tested several times, hoping for some answers. The Nevada-based National Institute for Discovery Science in 1996 sent a sample of the object to the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. 'The metallurgical analysis was pretty mundane,' said Colm Kelleher, a scientist at the National Institute for Discovery Science. 'We didn\'t find any evidence that it was extraterrestrial. Now you can make the argument that we didn\'t spend $1 million and look at every conceivable option. We didn\'t cover every base.' Another scientist who tested it at a California laboratory — and who asked that his name and that of the laboratory not be used — said, 'It didn\'t show any extraterrestrial signature.' Sgt. Gary Carpenter, who works at the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado Springs, Colo., said it was not uncommon for NORAD to get calls about strange lights and unidentified objects. Not once, he said, has the object been identified as an alien spacecraft. 'Usually it turns out to be space debris from a satellite that\'s decaying, or it\'s in the realm of naturally occurring, celestial lights,' he said. 'It could be something like a falling star. It could be contrails, the things you would see trailing an aircraft.' White opened the Museum of the Unexplained with visions of turning it into a destination. He wasn\'t looking to get rich — according to the Missouri secretary of state\'s office, the museum was registered as a nonprofit organization in August 2000 — but he hoped to spread the word about his experience. The museum, about 13 miles north of the glitzy Branson strip, might as well be in another world. There are no neon signs pointing the way, no twinkling lights outside the front door. Rather, it\'s sandwiched between the Humane Society thrift shop and the Sunrise Cafe on Main Street. It has struggled, unable to tap into the Branson spinoff crowd and secure a niche audience of its own. Only 2,800 people went through the doors that first year, when admission was free, and the museum hasn\'t been able to replicate those numbers since. These days, patrons age 12 and older pay $5 to stroll through about 2,000 square feet of space. Exhibits include a keyboard from the movie 'Men in Black II' in which the shift key doesn\'t capitalize or decapitalize but translates from English to an alien language. Other exhibits are little more than newspaper articles or passages from the Internet affixed to the wall with thumb tacks. The focal point is White\'s artifact, and he takes no chances with its safety. Motion detectors, closed-circuit TV and window and door alarms protect it at all times. White packs it up in a gun case every day at 5 p.m., and the object never spends the night at the same place two nights in a row. You can never be too sure, he figures, even in a town with just 465 residents. 'I\'m happy for them that they\'re having a good time, but I guess I\'m just not into that kind of thing,' said Kacee Cashman, the Reeds Spring city clerk since 1998. 'I really think they\'ve been accepted, but everybody\'s kind of taking it with a grain of salt.' Said White, 'I don\'t know what I have to do to prove this is the truth. You can\'t make this stuff up.'source:The Seattle TimesBy Steve RockKnight Ridder Newspapers', 'Man Confronted With Occupants In Craft 1985Date: August 1985-Time: 7:00pm-Location: Mayfair-Witnesses: familyA gentleman called to relate an experience he and his family had back in 1985.

His well known book,  'Communion' is a UFO classic. It was also made into a movie by the same name. In upper state New York over the 1985 Christmas holidays, Strieber was staying in his isolated cabin with his wife and son. At this time, Strieber was already a well know writer. He had become somewhat suspect of potential intruders, and had recently installed a high tech alarm system in the cabin.At approximately 11:00 PM on the 26th of December, he activated the system, and the family retired for the night. After a couple of hours, he was awakened by an unusual sound. He felt that the security of his cabin had been breached. He was soon shocked to see a creature in his bedroom.After this, the next thing he knew he was sitting in the woods which surrounded his cabin. His memories of what had occurred were fragmented. Eventually, to reestablish memories of that night, and understand what had really happened, he would undergo regressive hypnosis by Dr. Donald F. Klein.The hypnotic regression would uncover many of the details of his experience. He recalled that he had been 'floated' out of his bedroom and into a waiting UFO. He would see four different types of alien beings, one a small, robot type of being, secondly, a short, stocky type, the third was very slender and weak looking. It had mesmerising black eyes that slanted, and the last being had black, button eyes.He was subjected to medical testing by these aliens. One of these was the insertion of a needle into his brain, and another involved an object being inserted into his rectum. The beings took a blood sample from him by making an incision in his finger.The recounting of the most bizarre facts, caused Dr. Klein to diagnose Strieber with 'temporal lobe epilepsy.' This condition can cause one to have hallucinations. Strieber did not accept the diagnosis, and recounted his abduction as a real event. He would eventually establish a foundation as a support group for alien abductees.source and references:Whitley Streiber, 'Communion'http://www.unknowncountry.com/', '1985-Close Encounter on Interstate 84, Connecticut In the past, the state of Connecticut has always been an area of few UFO reports, however this is no longer true. Since 1985 the counties of Fairfield and Litchfield and Hartford has seen a dramatic rise in the number of UFO reports. This UFO is described as being a semi circle or boomerang with multi-colored lights. Even more incredible the size of this UFO has been reported to be the length of a football field!.  This UFO that has been seen recently in Connecticut is without a doubt the Hudson valley UFO which is described in my book Night Seige The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings (Ballantine Books 1987).  For some reason unknown to this researcher the giant boomerang UFO has shifted it\'s activities from New York to Nearby Connecticut. The most recent sightings took place on May 26 of this year around interstate 84 one of the most heavily traveled highways in the northeast.  Between 9;30 and 10;15 PM more than 200 people phoned local and state police to report a huge object with bright lights flying low over the highway near the towns of Newtown and Southbury in Connecticut. Those witnesses that called state police in Southbury were told that it was nothing more than a group of Ultra light aircraft from Candlewood airport flying in close formation and hanging colored lanterns from the bottom of the plane. The police also told witnesses that the aircraft were painted black so that all that can be seen is the lights. Many of the witnesses to the phenomenon found it very hard to believe the official explanation.  One witnesses to the UFO was Mrs. Betty Proulx of Middlebury who said that the object hovered over her house without a sound for over two minutes.here was no doubt in her mind that what she was looking at was one solid object.When Mr. Proulx heard about the explanation he could not accept it since he was in the air division of the Navy. 'It was one craft and like no aircraft that I have ever seen in my life'.  Another witnesses was Mr. Randy Etting a commercial airline pilot with over thirty years of experience. Mr. Etting said that the idea of the ultra light theory 'is the prattling of idiots' Mr. Etting observed the lights from his home in Newtown Connecticut at about 9:45 PM. He said that there were at least eight lights of different colors flying very close together and without a sound. As the object passed his home he observed it in a pair of 7 X 35 binoculars. Mr. Etting told me that the UFO was one object and he saw some type of heat waves coming from the object which distorted the area around the lights. Mr. Etting watched the object with neighbors and his son for over ten minutes as it slowly drifted to the north west. All the witnesses agree that the UFO was one solid object and round in appearance.  The Etting party was observing the UFO while it was passing close to I-84. At this time over a dozen cars pulled over to view the UFO as it passed overhead. One witness a Charlie Tuperman described what happened that night.  'It was about 9:30 or so and I was driving East on 84 around the Southbury area when I noticed these lights ahead of me. They were low and it looked like a 747 was going to land on the highway.This thing had about ten lights in kind of a half circle and the lights were yellow, green, blue, white and red. This thing was going very slow and moving from the east to the west. All of a sudden every one on both sides of the road began slamming on their brakes and pulling over to the side. It was a dangerous thing to do since there were several trucks apparently trying the same thing. I pulled over and watched this thing pass directly over the west bound lanes. I saw a dark mass behind the lights and there was no sound. I saw the lights of a state trooper just ahead of me and I figured he was called to see what was going on. Then all of a sudden this thing gets real bright, I mean all the lights just got ten times brighter for about ten seconds or so, then they faded to where they were before and that is about as bright as a planes wing lights. That really scared me. I wanted to get going because I thought there was some type of invasion or something,I just wanted to get home. Besides I was afraid of some trucker plowing into my car. I watched it head west and lost it . I turned on the radio for news, but didn\'t hear anything about any UFOs on any of the local stations'.  Close Encounter in New Milford  At about 10:00 after the series of sightings in the I-84 area. The UFO was seen heading to the west. It was then seen in the New Milford Connecticut area by a Robert Nellis his friend Jeff and Mr. Nellis dog. They were all in Nellis car off a side road off Route 7 in the northern area of New Milford. They were driving home after a long day of boating upstate along the Connecticut river.The dog began to bark and cry and at that point Jeff looked over to the northeast to see a number of bright lights hovering over a stand of pine trees less than a quarter mile away. They stopped the car and at that time their car radio began to sound 'funny' with all types of strange sounding static that interfered with the station that they were listening to.  They stopped the car and continued to watch the lights. At this moment the lights began to move slowly towards them. They were amazed at the size of the object, 'larger than a football field'. The dog continued to bark as the object passed over their car . Neil looked up and saw a very dark structure connecting the lights that extended toward the rear of the object. He said it was teardrop in shape and the lights in the front were in a half circle.The object was so large he said that' it covered the sky and blocked out everything overhead'  The object he said was made of some type of 'dark grey material with very little reflect ability'. There was no sound and they estimated that the giant UFO was no more than 500 feet above their car. The UFO then passed over their car and then shifted towards the north. They both noticed some type of flashing lights under the object that gave the impression as if something was moving. They watched the UFO slowly move away. The total duration of the sighting was ten minutes, however both men arrived home forty minutes later. This is could be a case of missing time, or the witnesses observed the object longer than they thought.  Neil would call me for several days after my interview with him since he felt 'uneasy and upset' about his Close Encounter. My research team and I are still investigating this case and it seems that it may be another of the many missing time cases that are escalating in the area. Photographic Proof  This UFO was so bright and large that it was only a matter of time before someone would come forward with a photograph. To our surprise we were contacted by a person of high standing in the Southbury area who took a picture of the object as it moved very slowly over I-84 at about 9:30 PM. The photographer wishes to remain anonymous since his position is very sensitive. He his a very highly trained college educated man who fears that the publicity surrounding the photograph could hurt his career. He gave us full rights to the photograph and his sighting account providing we do not use his real name. We will refer to him as David. (This person was actually Randy Etting; B J) David was on I-84 on Official business when he saw the lights. The lights were in the northwest and heading east. As he watched, the object tilted and all the lights got much brighter.He was pulled off the road at the time and had his camera ready. The UFO was about 45 degrees above the horizon. Due to traffic he had time to take only one picture. His camera was a 35 mm with a 50 mm lens at 1.8, the film type was Kodacolor ASA 400 and the exposure was 1/60th of a second, or 1/125.  He was not sure of the setting, but feels it was 1/60th of a second. The object then moved toward the east without a sound. During an interview with this researcher, David told me that the he was sure there was a solid object behind the lights. He also said that when the object turned it looked like the lights on the sides were pulling out from the main mass, but he realized that this effect was due to the object changing position from his point of view.  What about the Photo:  Several photo-analysis experts are now looking at the photograph. Our initial study showed that the image is without a doubt hanging in the sky above the ground. Also the photograph was looked at by Dr. Willy Smith a scientists and UFO researcher of some repute. Dr. Smith\'s initial calculations show the object to be anywhere from 650-1600 across!  We believe that this photograph is one of the best nighttime UFO pictures taken in the past twenty years. There were quite a few witnesses to the sighting over a twenty-five mile radius, all reporting the same thing. A close examination of the original negative shows that the lights are reflecting off of some type of structure in the central part of the object.Also the lights are in a perfect half circle. There is no doubt that what ever the UFO photograph represents it is one solid object. We hope to get more data on the photograph and the sightings in the weeks to come. I have taken an add in the local papers asking for videos and photographs and sighting accounts from that night.  A Rational Explanation?  What about the theory that the UFO is nothing more than Ultra lights from Candlewood airport. We questioned state police on this theory. An officer stated that they made a mistake about the airport, it wasn\'t Candlewood but Stormville airport. A flight instructor at Stormville later told us that there is only one Ultra light at Stormville and it only flies in the day since it is illegal for them to fly at night.  The UFO sightings in the Northeast continue. In the days to follow I received several calls from witnesses who saw formations of military helicopters in the sighting area. One witnesses took a picture of this formation. Is the government involved in the mysterious happenings over the Connecticut area? Many of the residents feel that the government is well aware of the UFO and is doing its best to play down the sightings by explaining them away.  I called nearby Bradley international airport to find out if they had any information about the sightings. I was informed by air traffic control that no formations or large aircraft were tracked on radar at that location and time.  I was also told that unless the 'aircraft' have transponders (a device placed in aircraft that helps identify them on radar) in them they would not be picked up at that location at an altitude of less than 2,000 feet. I have enough witnesses in different locations at the same time observing the UFO to determine that the approximate altitude was between 1,000 and 1300 feet.  Based on this information my calculations indicate that the span of lights was at least 900 feet! Its apparent size in the sky was quite large, this is evident by the image on the 35 mm frame that takes up almost half the negative.  It is obvious from the photograph and by the witness statements that something more than ultra light aircraft was in the sky over Connecticut that night. source:Philip J.

A 'blob' shot out and downward from the light, and projected a cone of brilliant (greenish?) light at the ground below. Two additional beams appeared, and features on the ground could be seen to be illuminated. One beam then swung around and illuminated the aircraft cabin. The light appeared to approach and resolved into a greenish luminosity as much as several degrees in extent, which then paralleled their course. 'There were multiple lights of different colors and fiery zig-zags that crossed the vapor.'It lit up like a Christmas tree.'At this point, the aircraft was coming within range of the ground controller, who could then also see the object. The object seemed to change shape. 'It developed an \'appendage\' and then \'became\' a \'wingless cloud-aircraft with a pointed tail\' (the spike?). The yellow and green glow, like phosphorescence, was eerily intertwined'. A second aircraft was vectored nearby and also could see the object near the first aircraft. Talinn approach radar detected the aircraft and the object, and also experienced unusual radar interference.source:http://www.temporaldoorway.com/ufo/catalog/tailedobject/index.htmRandles, The UFO Conspiracy, ISBN 1-56619-195-5 p 115']

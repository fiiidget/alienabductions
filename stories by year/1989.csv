1989,'Conclusions1989 Brecon Beacons UFO Sighting ReportBy Dave HodrienSighting DetailsBack in November 1989, my girlfriend Katie Francis, and her great aunt Janice had a stunning close encounter with a UFO while crossing the Brecon Beacons. It is something that even after all these years they remember quite vividly. After interviewing them both about the incident I can now reveal to you what occurred.At the time of the sighting, Katie was eleven years old and her brother Tim was five. They had been on holiday visiting Janice at Leamington Spa. She was driving them home to Neath in South West Wales. Their journey took them across the Brecon Beacons moor. It was early evening and quite dark in the sky, but the moorland was still partially visible. The weather was clear and there was very little cloud. The road was deserted and there were no other cars on it. Katie was sitting on the back seat next to her brother and staring out of the back window of the car.She noticed in the sky an object with a row of coloured lights along it. The object was quite far away and high up. There were too many lights along it to be a normal aircraft. They were flashing and changing colours, mostly white and red, but some other colours too.The object was moving slowly across the sky. Katie alerted her great aunt to the object, and she also glanced back at it. The object seemed to keep changing position in the sky. It was there one minute, gone the next, and it kept reappearing in different places in relation to the moving car. Janice was trying to scare Katie and Tim about the object, saying it was going to come and get them.Suddenly, the object appeared much closer to the car and much lower in the sky, Katie estimates under 100 foot up.  Both Katie and Janice could now clearly see that the lights were in a curved line as if along the edge of a large disc shaped object, however the main body of the object could not be seen.Katie estimates that it was at least twice as big as a house. It was behind and to the right of the car hovering in the sky. At this point Janice decided to stop to get a photograph of the object as she was very interested in what it could be. She pulled up at the side of the road and got out. She went round to the back of the car and opened the boot to get her camera. The object appeared to now be stationary and it was completely silent. Katie started to panic at this point and was screaming at Janice to get back in the car. Janice was also a little unnerved by the object, but mostly fascinated by it. She got the camera out but couldn’t work out how to use the night setting on it. Because of this, and the fact that Katie was very frightened, she decided to get back in the car and continue driving. After this. neither witness looked back to see if the object was still following them so it was not seen again.Janice also informed me of something else unusual which occurred. Shortly after they continued on their journey, there was suddenly a huge glow of bluish-white light that lit up the hills in front of the car. The glow lasted for up to ten seconds before dying away. Janice felt it was linked to the object which they had seen but because Katie was frightened she did not tell her about it.A Related Sighting?In June 2008, Dr Simon Griffey saw mysterious lights over the Brecon Beacons. His reported sighting has numerous similarities with what Katie and Janice witnessed. Below is the article that appeared in The Sun on 27th June 08 including a photograph:The Green Green Men Of HomeBy JOHN COLES A baffled university don who spotted a UFO over the Brecon Beacons last night said: “There is no logical explanation.” Dr Simon Griffey saw lights loom over a mountain village – before they disappeared. His close encounter is the third reported in the space of just five days, following sightings by the Army and police. Simon, a doctor of psychology at Cardiff University, said: “I’ve had loads of theories proposed by friends and neighbours but none of them add up.” Dr Griffey, 50, and his son Jack, 23, were driving near Llangynidr Mountain in the Brecon Beacons, Powys, when they spotted lights over Talybont-on-Usk. He said: “There was no noise whatsoever, it was a bit eerie. I’ve driven over this mountain for 17 years and have never seen anything like it. There were seven lights and having read the description from the soldiers in Shropshire, there are some similarities. They were the same sort of colour and the same spherical shape that they reported. I know I wasn’t seeing things because Jack saw exactly the same as I did – and two other cars pulled over to look.” Sceptics have suggested the sightings could be huge man-made lanterns floating into the sky. But the boffin, of Llangynidr, said: “It was too big. It was way above the horizon and stayed there for 15 minutes. It was a bit smaller than a full moon – quite big and high up.” Jack recorded the phenomenon on his mobile phone – but when they examined the pictures later, they found only three of the seven lights showed up.ConclusionsTo this day, both witnesses are convinced that the object they saw was definitely not a conventional aircraft or helicopter of any kind. The arrangement and number of lights on the object, and the way that they were changing colours seem to suggest something very unusual. Janice and Katie both mentioned independently that the object was very large and disc-shaped even though the main body of it could not be made out. Also the object was completely silent even when it approached, and it seemed to be able to move or hover still in the air at will. The area of the Brecon Beacons is used for military training and often jets are flown over it. Could the object have been a secret advanced aircraft of some kind? This is a possibility, but if this were the case then why did it appear to be following the witness’s car as if interested in it? Surely the pilots would have wanted to keep such a craft away from the eyes of the public? The glowing light that lit up the hillside shortly after the sighting of the UFO is also very interesting. The only natural thing which could possibly account for such a sight would be sheet lightning. However Janice said that it stayed visible far too long for it to have been this. Also the weather was clear and it only occured once so it seems very unlikely that this would have been the cause. In all the years since the years since the incident, Janice has never seen anything else like it, even though she has driven over the Brecon Beacons many times.Thanks to Craig at www.bufog.com for sending along the article.', 'NAVIGATION1989 Brecon Beacons UFO Sighting ReportBy Dave HodrienSighting DetailsBack in November 1989, my girlfriend Katie Francis, and her great aunt Janice had a stunning close encounter with a UFO while crossing the Brecon Beacons.

These also appear to have the ability to change color. Although they are predominantly white they are sometimes seen as partially red or black. Assuming the craft is 100 feet in diameter these outer panels take up about 40 feet or 20 feet on each side. Below the center of craft there appears to be a crystal or lights with crystal like appearance. Generally these lights appear blue. craft appears to rotate in the photos. Graham gave me his word that these were authentic photographs of an actual flying craft to the best knowledge. He has known the photographer for 24 years and the man worked for him for ten years. He has always been know to tell the truth and was of high character.Editor's Note: I have observed a UFO at close distance. The colors of the smoke probably are a coronal discharge similar to what I saw. The lights themselves have an unusual depth of color. When you look at a coloredlight it is normally a white light covered by a lens of red, yellow, green, blue etc. The lights on the craft appear as if the light contain the actual color. There is a vividness of color that is difficult to describe that appears to be in these photos. The fog or plasma is penetrated by the powerful lights shining downward. The lights extend down for an estimated seventy-five feet to one hundred plusfeet and seem to stop abruptly. Duplication of this capability is exceptionally difficult to accomplish with any normal lights. I have never seen lights that have these properties except on a UFO, nor have I seen comparable photography. I have over 5000 hours flying time and taken thousands of photographs. I would be very interested in any similar photographs or videos of a comparable craft.source:http://www.nationalufocenter.com/features/bethune.htm', 'Large V-Shaped UFO Encounter with US Navy Nuclear SubmarineOctober 24, 1989 - A sailor reports about the UFO sighting he had while in the Navy. 'I was assigned to USS Memphis (SSN-698), Homeport - Titusville, FL. (Cape Canaveral.)Our mission was Special Assignments which meant we protected the Space Program. We would go to sea and patrol while the shuttle was on the pad.On October 24 and 25, 1989, my ship was on patrol about 150 miles of the Florida coast. We were cruising at about 500 feet when the submarine started experiencing electronics problems.The ship was malfunctioning, our tanks were blowing out of control, we were losing navigation ability and the communications area was totally lost.We went to all stop and tried to access what was happening. The controls in the reactor area started to malfunction. This presented a serious danger to our safety, so the captain ordered us to shut down the reactor, surface and go to diesel motors.When the ship surfaced I went to my watch station. The ship was still experiencing electronic difficulties but the mechanical devices such as diesel engines, cook stoves, and turbines were fine.It was raining and the entire sky was red like a red neon sign.I saw a large inverted V-shaped UFO off the port side. The executive officer told me to stand fast and he would speak to the captain. In a minute, the captain appeared on the tower and asked me for a distance to the craft.The laser range finder determined the closest point was 200 meters, and the farthest point was 1,000 meters off the port. The UFO was not perpendicular to our ship but at about a 45\' angle.This huge vessel was over a half mile across. The UFO made a half circle around our ship then passed across the stern causing our electronics systems to go crazy.We had permanent damage in communications and the sonar room. As the craft flew over the stern, I could see the rain stop under its red glow.The water seemed to rise almost a foot as the UFO passed over silently. When the UFO finished its swing across the stern it paused - the sky got brighter red and it simply moved off at tremendous speed inside 15 seconds.When the UFO left, our boat returned to normal with the exception of the radio and sonar. We did a quick system check and the captain ordered us to return to reactor power and get underway.The captain took two petty officers, the executive officer, and myself into the wardroom. He told us to not spread any rumors until we had a chance to talk to Commander Submarine Fleet - Atlantic.We reached port in about 7 hours where I was taken into 'protective custody.'Two enlisted men and myself agreed we had witnessed a real UFO. I was the one who shot it with a laser range finder, so I was the only one that had its exact sizes. I shot that vessel as it hovered and I got solid readings, not spotty like I would on debris.We were in holding for about three hours when an officer from the Air Force arrived and gave us a line of bull about an exploding weather satellite.The Navy then transferred virtually everyone on the crew to new assignments.This included the captain, the executive officer and the entire crew. They were split up which almost never happens unless one of them gets a promotion or a new command, neither of which happened.The military just split up a 4 year team. I was watching a program tonight that gave me the courage to share it.', '1989-The Battle of the Flying SaucersWell known Russian UFO investigator Nikolay Subbotin relates an amazing story of a battle of flying saucers. This incident  allegedly took place in the skies of Zaostrovka, in Russia in 1989. On September 16, six circular, silver, flying saucers ganged up and fought a seventh, golden saucer, in full view of the residents of the town and surrounding areas. Hundreds of witnesses watched the gang of six chase the golden saucer out of a cloud bank. All of the saucers made unbelievable maneuvers during this dog fight, and at times, the UFOs flew as low as 5,000 feet. The weapon of choice was a strong beam of light or energy fired at and from the escaping golden UFO.According to the RUFORS Internet newsletter, an account of this event was  published in the local newspaper, 'Semipalatinsk.' According to this report, written by a Russian helicopter commander in the Afghan war, the energy emitted during this battle shut down the local power grid in Zaostrovka, plunging the city into total darkness for a time. The author, named Sichenko, interviewed witnesses of the event, publishing many of their fantastic accounts of the events that day.The witnesses claimed that the outnumbered golden UFO finally was defeated, losing altitude due to the continued hits by the energy beams. The failing saucer at first seemed to be attempting to make a controlled landing, but eventually it lost control, disappearing from view behind a house as it plunged to the ground. The six assaulting saucers soon disappeared from view, heading into the clouds.Subbotin discovered that the lost saucer had crashed into a bog on a military test range. This area was 'off limits' to the general public. It would be about a year before he and accompanying researchers could reach the site of the crash, but by that time, the area was clean, free of any trace of a crashed vehicle. Subbotin would learn that a military team had descended on the boggy area, and conducted a full search and rescue operation. There were reported injuries during this operation. Russian Ufologist Emil Bachurin was able to see medical files which confirmed details of injuries to military personnel involved in the mission.It would be reported that several members of the search and rescue team had leaked information about the operation,  but their breach of confidence was discovered, and security was made even tighter. Also, an airplane attempting to fly over the area and gather details about the crash had to abort its mission because of instrument malfunction.Eventually, all activities at the military range were shut down, and the base put under heavy guard. This case is very  similar to another Russian case, the Shaitan Mazar Crash, which also involved Subbotin and Bachurin.If the event of 1989 is true, there is a downed flying saucer in the possession of the Russian military, or possibly being guarded by the military in its own icy grave in the city of Zaostrovka.

Birnes, and Harold Burt', 'The Phobos II Incident, January 1989In the October 19, 1989 issue of Nature Magazine, Soviet scientistsconcluded that the craft could be spinning because it was impacted.It has long been rumored that Mars and its moon Phobos are aliencolonies. The surface of Mars is covered with strangeshapes/buildings that do not appear to be natural such as thepyramids, square buildings, runways, etc. One structure shows theface of a man with a helmet looking into space. It can be seen at theNational Space Science Data Center, Viking photo with catalog number76-A-593/17384 Titled 'HEAD.'  Another photo is 070-A-13. There arenow eleven Viking photographs (and growing) of this obviously intelligentlyconstructed monument on the surface of Mars. The 'HEAD' and otherartificial features such as the pyramids were combined by electrical engineer andimaging specialist Vincent DiPietro and a Lockheed computer scientist.The composite images seemed to show that the featureson the surface of Mars had been artificially sculpted... Just maybe, WE ARE NOTALONE!', 'Alleged UFO Crash in Russia 1989At approximately 11:00 AM on August 10, 1989 near the city of Prohladnyi, Russia, Soviet military radar units detected an unidentified flying object. After attempts to communicate went unanswered, the object was noted as 'hostile.'Defense systems were put on alert, with utilization of surface to air missiles, and the deployment of Mig-25s. Blasting out of Rostov and Krymsk, the Migs were ordered to intercept and identify the unknown object.The UFO was on a north heading, like foreign missiles or planes would be, and the order was given to arm and use weapons. A ground to air missile hit the UFO, causing it to ditch over the Caucasian Mountains.A retrieval team on board an M1-8 helicopter was sent, and the disc-shaped object was located outside of Nizhnizy Chegem, and the area around the crash site was soon cordoned off. The object was 6.9 meters long and 3.0 meters high, shaped like a cockleshell, according to witnesses.A long rut in the earth could be seen leading to the craft, which had smashed into an area of rocks. The damage from the missile was obvious, causing the object to lose its original shape. A team with special protective equipment moved into the scene. Dosimeters detected radiation, and precautionary measures were immediately taken, but not before some team members had been exposed.The object was delivered by helicopter to Mozdok Air Base, where nuclear weapons and long range bombers were housed. A special investigative team was assembled, and sent to the base to begin an investigation into the mysteries of the unknown flying object. This team consisted of military and civilian personnel. The KGB began a cover-up operation.The craft research team gained entry into the craft via a partially opened door. The team was in full protective gear as they began their investigation of the inside of the craft. As one would expect, control panels and equipment was visible, but more importantly three alien creatures, two dead were found. The two dead aliens had apparently been killed by falling equipment, but the third managed to save itself, but was suffering from several wounds.A medical team attempted to keep the alien alive, but their efforts failed. He and his two companions were about 1.0-1.2 meters tall, with whitish gray skin that appeared to be outer cover. The real skin beneath this cover was a blue-green color with a reptilian texture. The other worldly beings also had hairless heads, large black eyes,  almost round, which were covered by a protective lid. Three web fingers were at the end of their long, slender arms. The three dead aliens were preserved in glass containers in a top-secret underground facility. This secret location is allegedly hidden among the multitude of trees near the research center east of Solnechnogorsk. The damaged disc was taken to the Kapustin Yar range and placed under ground west of Ahryomkin. All of the information included here originated from three Russian investigators; Anton Anfalov, Lenura Azizova and Alexander Mosolov. They claim that the disc is still housed near Kapustin Yar.source and references:written by B J Booth, based on information from Anton Anfalov, Lenura Azizova and Alexander Mosolov.', 'Sullivan County Tennessee UFO Sighting, 1989Sullivan County, TN, July 1989I interviewed two witnesses today. One, an elderly woman and the other, her son. These witnesses related to me a sighting which took place in the summer, July of 1989.The two witnesses were sitting under the edge of their carport enjoying the pleasant night and it was about midnight.One witness (the son) noted a very large and burning object moving straight at them and very low on the horizon. Both witnesses began watching as the object passed slowly overhead. Separately, they described the object as being almost wing like and slightly swept back on its extreme ends.  Shape was described as alar, with an aspect of 8 X 1, (8 being width) The object was seen to be burning intensely and 'dripping fire', much like burning plastic. They described that as the object passed overhead, the fire was dripping straight down and not trailing behind it as it moved and that it was of a relative size equal to their arms spread wide, exceptionally large. The object passed them and moved off to the southeast continuing to drip fire and passed Holston mountain in the distance. The moment it was out of view, a deep intense rumble was heard from the direction of the object. The object was noted to have been moving very slowly, the duration of the sighting agreed to by both witnesses, having lasted at least one minute, possibly more.The primary witness called the FAA office at tri-city airport and was told that nothing was/had been present on radar. He also called the local Sheriff office where he was told that many calls had came in and that they did not know what it was.Having checked cataloged sightings for that approximate date, we can arrive at no conclusions except that it must have been a fantastic sighting.

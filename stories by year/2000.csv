2000,'Derbyshire Dales UFO Footage (Sharon Rowlands) 2000£20,000 SAYS THIS IS A UFO -When housewife Sharon Rowlands filmed what appeared to be a UFO flying over her tiny Derbyshire village, little did she realise what rewards the footage would bring her. The 6-and-a-half-minute tape has been snapped up by an American TV company for more than £20,000. Mrs Rowlands can also be proud of the knowledge her film is being ranked as one of the best pieces of UFO video footage ever shot. California-based Kiviat Productions, which snapped up the film, is currently negotiating with TV networks across the world to show the tape as part of its \'Could It Be True?\' Series - but not before officials from NASA are given a preview. Mrs Rowlands (44), who lives with husband Hayden (45), said: 'I\'ve watched UFO programmes and if there is such a thing, this is as good a photograpgh as you\'re going to get. 'I was a complete and utter disbeliever but seeing this has made me think twice. It was huge and through the lens it looked like it was going to hit me. I couldn\'t believe it - it\'s like nothing else I\'ve ever seen.' The tape has been locked in a bank vault since her chance filming on October 5, 2000, with a camcorder which she had received only days earlier as a gift. Kiviat executive producer Robert Kiviat found Mrs Rowlands\' film while scouring the internet. He said: 'This is one of the top five pieces of video footage of UFOs ever taken.' The Rowlands are just a couple living in a remote area with no agenda and no previous experience in UFO videos - they just appear to have had their camcorder out at the right time.' A Meteorological Officer spokesman said there were no freak weather conditions on October 5 which could have caused the circular shape in the sky. The American space agency NASA is believed to be interested in the Rowland\'s photograph because of its marked resemblance to a photograph taken during the 1996, STS-75 mission. The photograph was taken by Astronaut Claude Nicoltier.From 1970 to 1973, Claude Nicoltier worked as a graduate scientist with the Institute of Astronomy at Lausanne University and at the Geneva Observatory. He then joined the Swiss Air Transport School in Zurich and was assigned as a DC-9 pilot for Swissair, concurrently participating part-time in research activities of the Geneva Observatory. At the end of 1976 he accepted a Fellowship at the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Space Science Department at Noordwijk, Netherlands, where he worked as a research scientist in various airborne infrared astronomy programs. In July 1978 he was selected by ESA as a member of the first group of European astronauts. Under agreement between ESA and NASA he joined the NASA astronaut candidates selected in May 1980 for astronaut training as a mission specialist.Mrs Rowlands\' footage capped a hive of activity in Bonsall which has seen villagers reporting 19 UFO sightings in just four months leading up to last October. UFO enthusiast Omar Fowler founded the Derby-based Phenomenon Research Association 10 years ago and has been tracking UFOs since the 1970s. He believes Bonsall is right up there with the foremost UFO hotbeds - including Mexico city, the USA, and Fleetwood in Lancashire. Mr Fowler said: 'I viewed Mrs Rowlands\' tape and I was amazed at what I saw. I consider it to be one of the most important sightings of recent years - comparing very well with a recent clip from Mexico - and it typifies activity in Bonsall.' Mr Kiviat said he will show the tape to NASA optical physicist Dr. Bruce Macabbee. 'The Rowlands\' tape will shock a lot of people because the image shown is the same as one taken by NASA\'s own cameras showing what appears to be a UFO hovering in space, maybe three miles wide,' Mr Kiviat said.

A large part of this program was a reconstruction video of the events by the National Institute of Discovery Science (NISD). This program was shown twice on Discovery, 11/30/00 and 12/2/00. The reconstruction was based on the following criteria.1) A survey crew was hired to take physical measurements of all locations from the different eyewitnesses. In this way an exact series of measurements regarding the location, direction, and distance of the flying object from the observers was possible. 2)A professional interviewer was hired who conducted face-to-face interviews with each witness at all locations. Photographs were taken of each location. 3)A 40 watt Argon laser with steering optics was used at each location with the help of each eyewitness to take the exact flight path of the object as determined from the perspective of each eyewitness. The eyewitnesses each determined the specific placement of the laser beams. 4)The reconstructed testimony was used to construct a series of 3D aerial grids for each location. Then a 3D CAD package was used to create a rough model of the object as seen by the different eyewitnesses. A second animation modeling software package was used to fine-tune the details. Each eyewitness was consulted on a regular basis to verify the accuracy of the computer modeling process. With multiple iterations, the modeling tools fine-tuned the recreation into a final animation. The computer-generated models were then merged with live footage so that the exact scale, size, and flight path of the object was precisely reconstructed to the satisfaction of each eyewitness. ', 'Stinson Lake UFO Photo, 2000February 2000 - Strangely Shaped UFO Photographed   Stinson Lake, proximate to a U.S. army training area, may be an alien or government UFO base, or a focus of investigation or travel by aliens, one reason being possible mining as the area is rich in precious minerals. A mirror ship was photographed directing a beam of light at the hillside. Two questions that come to mind are: What was it? And why was it at an army operations area?   I was given a photograph last night of an object above the snow covered evergreens in the soupy late afternoon February sky of 2000 at Stinson Lake. It is not a painted object such as blue underneath and white on top, or black, or part metal and paint...   It is like a mirror reflecting the milky white sky above and the forest below color for color, tone for tone, hue for hue with intensity above surrounding fields at nearest equator and diminishing below surrounding fields (slightly faded at outer or left and right edges) undeniably displaying a round or roundish shape.   There are no wings and no engines noise according to the photographer. There is a shadow outlining its shape in a clearing below it and the same shadow is on the underside reflection. There's more.   After closely examining the object utilizing digital enhancement techniques, globes are seen underneath with hints of green and white lights, a possible dome on top which almost completely blends in with the sky and globular energy field where there are color shifts in the pixel spectrum where there are no added colors but a reorganization of existing colors suggesting a mirage effect also seen with the Mexico videos. The shifted field forms a perfect globe around the object exactly touching is outer edge no matter the attitude of the craft.   Sitting back a little from a 600% enlargement on the monitor screen, a field 'net' effect is obvious. The field appears webbed like a fish net formed into a globe and transparent white. Further, there is evidence of a beam of light pointing at a dark round spot also in a clearing on a nearby hill.   Above the object is a mushroom-shape distortion similar to the globular energy field but larger, which raises the question of the portal of origin or a second ship. It was so sudden, the photographer never had any indication of what was about to transpire as he shot landscape photographs in the otherwise peaceful environs around him.   The photographer happened to be at the site near where the U.S. Army has historically conducted paratrooper and other training. The Army's conventional presence may well have been replaced by something extremely advanced. But the sightings have not diminished in that remote and tranquil location unlikely to be stumbled upon by any tourist. ', ' Large UFO Lands Near Village In West Malaysia, 3-6-00TANAH MERAH, KELANTAN: A large object emitting rays of light was reported to have landed on a piece of marshland here three days ago, holding some 1,000 people of Kampung Gobek in a state of high suspense.   The residents said yesterday they saw the shining object land at 3am.   'The lights from the object came in intervals, similar to lightning, but there was no sign of rain,' Mohamad Mat Diah, 51, said.   'The light from the object was very bright and the rays bathed the inside of my house.   'I suspected something was happening outside and looked out and saw the object hovering over the marshland for several minutes,' he added.   Mohamad said at daybreak he went over to the area some 100m from his house and saw a \'Y\' shaped depression measuring 15m by 5m which could have been caused by the unidentified flying object (UFO).   Near the depression was another crescent shaped 3m deep hollow and three holes, one metre apart and each one metre in diameter, he said.   'I was accompanied to the area by two others who initially were afraid to come with me,' he said.   Another resident Saupi Salleh, 28, said he was awakened by the bright light.   'I clearly saw the light from the object,' he said.   'I thought it was lightning but when it prevailed I realised it was something else.'   He went to see the depression and concluded it must have been a heavy object.   Many residents were seen inspecting the landing site of the UFO.--Bernama   source:  http://thestar.com.my/online/newsreport.asp?file=/2000/3/6/nation/0603ktbu.asp&newspage;=nationUFO Research http://home.fuse.net/ufo/'

The area below him was illuminated for about 10 seconds by incandescent light and it was certainly not a light from another plane.'Three other aircraft saw it moving at a high speed or static. However, air traffic control were informed and they confirmed that there were no other planes in the vicinity.'Then, five minutes later, there was a brief radar return from a spot 75 miles away. We believe there was no danger involved.'The Luton-based 96-seater plane was flying company executives from Linkoping, Sweden, to Humberside airport. A spokesman for Debonair, which runs cut-price flights throughout Europe, said chief executive Franco Mancassola had been informed that a 'great red light in the sky' had been spotted near one of the company\'s planes.At one stage, the report says, the object came to an abrupt halt before accelerating past the airliner at thousands of miles an hour.A CAA source says the object was tracked by a military radar station in Yorkshire after it entered UK air space.A spokesman for the 6,000 member British Pilots Association said: 'We get reports of this nature from our members, but they are few and far between.'In the past 10 years or so I would say there have been around six cases of UFOs being sighted.'Many pilots are reluctant to make such claims because it tends to lay them open to ridicule. So when they do go as far as making a report we do expect it to be given credence.'A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence insisted there were no military aircraft in the area adding: 'We saw nothing.' © Express Newspapers LtdBy Simon BirdDaily Express (UK)From Mark Hall4-28-99The Mirror - LondonFrom Gerry Lovell4-28-99A passenger jet\'s crew have reported a close encounter with an unidentified flying object.They said that they noticed an 'incandescent' light below their Debonair BAe 146 as it headed over the North Sea from Sweden to Humberside.Then, they added, a long cylindrical silver-coloured object the size of a battleship flew alongside. The British plane\'s shocked captain saw what seemed to be rows of square portholes on the UFO before it vanished at 'enormous speed.'The crew told the Defence Ministry about their sighting. An RAF radar station tracked the object, which was seen from three other planes.', 'Disc-shaped object: Elk abduction: Washington State, 02-25-1999Within seconds of their first observation of the object, the witnesses became aware that the object was travelling generally in the direction of a herd of elk that they had been watching all morning. They continued to watch as the object proceeded toward the herd until it succeeded in getting quite close to the animals. The animals apparently remained unaware of the objectís presence until it was within a very short distance of the herd. Suddenly, the animals bolted, most of the them running up the slope to their east. However, one adult animal was seen by the witnesses to separate itself from the herd and run or trot to generally to the north, perhaps along a logging road. The witnesses report that at this point, the object quickly moved directly above the lone elk and seemed to lift it off the ground, although no visible means of support of the animal was evident to the observers. The witnesses added that shortly after lifting the elk off the ground, the object seemed to begin to 'wobble' to a more pronounced degree than it had exhibited earlier. In addition, as the object appeared to increase its altitude, the elk, which was suspended upright below the disc, rotated slowly beneath it and appeared to be getting closer to the ventral surface of the disc. They also commented that the object seemed to increase in size slightly after it had picked up the animal. With the elk suspended below it, the object began to ascend slowly up a clear-cut slope to the east. However, the witnesses watched it apparently brush the tops of nearby trees to the east, at which point it reversed its course and proceeded to the west. It executed a 360-degree turn to the left and may have gained some slight altitude in the process, the witnesses thought. After the object had completed its turn and was once again proceeding in a generally easterly direction, it began ascending very quickly at what seemed to the witnesses to be a rather steep angle. It continued to ascend, and simply disappeared from sight of the witnesses. The witnesses stated that once the object had started to ascend and had climbed to an altitude above their vantage point, they no longer could see the animal suspended below the craft. Their presumption was that the animal had somehow been taken into the craft, although the witnesses could discern no 'door,' or any kind of aperture through which the animal might have been conveyed into the craft.The witnesses also stated that following the incident, the herd of elk remained in the same general area, although remained more closely huddled to one another than had been the case earlier in the morning. The workers added that they, too, had remained closer to one another until their departure from the area at the end of the work day.', 'Disc-shaped object: Elk abduction: Washington State, 02-25-1999Within seconds of their first observation of the object, the witnesses became aware that the object was travelling generally in the direction of a herd of elk that they had been watching all morning.

Those who saw the unknown object called it 'something with small wings'. Military officials would stick with the 'nothing at all' explanation. Four different people claim to have seen an oblong object plunge into the waters of Backsjon. The object was described as about 15 feet long and about 4-5 feet wide. There was a definite splash as the object smacked into the lake, throwing water into the air. One witnesses contacted the rescue station in Arvika; they turned the inquiry back to local police, who made their report. Police Chief of Staff Stellan Jansson told the media that all witnesses of the event were interviewed.It would be the latter part of August that a full search of the lake began. Involved in the operation was the military, security police, and Arvika rescue personnel. Although witness statements were considered legitimate, the rescue teams soon discovered that a much more elaborate, and costly operation was needed. The lake was some 2 miles long, and a half mile wide.On the thirteenth day of September, 'Operation Sea Find' began. The team this time was composed of 14 men, of which 8 were expert divers. Also employed was Sweden\'s most high tech sonar equipment along with under water photography. A cover-up scenario was the explanation give to local residents, claiming that the entire operation was a home defense exercise.Officials stated several different reasons for their operations; one was that robberies in governmental facilities had breached security, and missing items could have been dropped into the lake, and also that if the object was found to be foreign made, it could be some type of surveillance equipment related to the recent thefts in the area.Rescue operations ultimately claimed that nothing of significance was found; only a plastic bag and a metal barrel, dashing the hopes of locals who thought something exotic might be found. Jansson told the community that ten full days was given to the search, and though they were confident that something would be found, they came up empty.Jansson also stated that because of the size of the lake, to fully search the lake would have taken a year or more. But, he was satisfied that if something unusual was in the lake, his team would have found it. A final report of rescue results was sent to government headquarters in Stockholm on October 1, 1999. Two pages of the report were not classified, but transcripts of security Police interviews and a description of the methods used in the search were classified.UFO-Sweden filed a request to de-classify the secret documents, but as of this writing, their requests have gone unfulfilled. Although there are many unanswered questions about this case, there is no evidence to support the fact that a UFO crashed into Lake Backsjön.(B J Booth)reference:UFO Swedenhttp://home.supernet.com/~rfisher/carbondale.html', 'February 3, 1999, Jet Crew Tell Of Close Encounter With UFO UFO Mystery As Pilots See Red   An unidentified object described as 'a great red light in the sky' and 'big as a battleship' has caused consternation in the skies over the North Sea.   Pilots reported being buzzed by a 'long, cylindrical object' at 28,000ft and one pilot and his crew described how the underside of their jet became bathed in an 'incandescent light'.   The Civil Aviation Authority has confirmed that a comprehensive report of the sightings has been handed in, although both it and the Ministry of Defence deny that they are investigating it.   The Luton-based plane, a Debonair BAe146, was flying company executives from Sweden to Humberside airport when, it is claimed, the object came to a sudden halt before speeding by the airliner in the incident on 3 February, 58 miles off the coast of Denmark.   I have today (5-4-99) obtained a copy of the official report by Debonair to the Civil Aviation Authority concerning the above sighting, which occurred on 3 February 1999.   The report was filed as 'a mandatory occurrence report' and the CAA were taking no further action as 'there was no danger to the aircraft or passengers.'   A spokesman for Debonair said the pilot is currently on leave and a request has been put out for him to make a statement to the press when he returns.   It was added that the pilot assumed the lights beneath the jet were those of another aircraft at the time they were seen. She said the company had been 'snowed under' with inquiries from the press about the sighting.   The Debonair report to the CAA report reads:   'Unidentified bright light below BAe146 at FL280.   'Area below a/c illuminated for 10 seconds by incandescent light which was not considered by reporter to be an a/c landing light.   Reporter stated three other a/c reported seeing it moving at high speed or static. ATC informed but they reported no other a/c in vicinity. Five minutes later a radar return was present at 75 miles on weather radar. Atmosphere reported as stable and no other a/c were in vicinity.'   The aircraft involved was a British Aerospace 146, a small four engined jet flying on a chartered flight from Linkoping in Sweden to Humberside Airport in East Yorkshire.   The UFO was reported whilst the aircraft was flying at 28,000 feet, 58 miles off the Danish coast above the North Sea. Tracey Law, of Humberside Airport, said the report was made by the pilot to the CAA on landing, but there was 'no mention made whatsoever of UFOs in the original report..it has since been embellished. It was not mentioned to us officially as it happened outside of our airspace.'   In particular she mentioned the description of the UFO as being 'as big as a battleship' being manufactured by the press, Humberside Airport said they believed the sighting had been caused by 'a light reflection from the underside of the jet.' Flight Lieutenant Tom Rounds of the RAF at the Ministry of Defence, Whitehall, said the MOD had learned of the report via the Press.   He said stories that the object had been tracked by RAF radar were 'laughable' as the UK radar could not pick up objects 58 miles off the Danish coast.   Flt Lieut Rounds said the MOD were not investigating the report, and had not received any report concerning it from the CAA.From David Clarke From UFO Updates,  updates@globalserve.net5-4-99Original story from The Evening Standard (London) 4-37-99', 'October 28, 1999-Abduction on Carlyle LakeCARLYLE LAKE, KEYSPORT -- During hypnosis of an October 28, 1999, abduction I was out boating on Carlyle Lake. I remembered the flight from the lake to the craft and getting a good view of our town from the air, and going through the floor of the UFO. The boat gradually moved over me and went through the bottom of the craft before I did. I did not get a good look of the UFO as I was concentrating on my boat and other possessions as we were brought through the floor. The next thing I recalled is standing inside the craft and seeing an examination table which was on a pedestal that almost reached the edge of the table. It was molded into the floor. There was some kind of structure over the table that looked like a light or some instruments. The room was rounded and I was guided to the table by a small gray. I remember getting up on the table as if I had done it before. At that moment, I discovered that my clothes were gone. Shortly there after a larger gray came up and put his face into mine and I felt he was sucking the memory out of me. I was okay afterward and left alone. I then tried to get to my clothes, but wound up back on the table. After I received some kind of examination, I again went to my clothes and the small grays helped me get them on. The next thing I remember is sitting in the boat and a ramp with a rounded front that opens up. The grays pushed me and the boat out some 750 feet above the northern portion of Carlyle Lake. I did not stay in the boat, but floated out.Afterwards, I just forgot the whole thing except the position change which was about one quarter of a mile and I was going in another direction. I have been able to determine that there were two abductions and one failed abduction before during the same year and have recalled parts of others with and without hypnosis. Two of the abductions and a failed abduction were recorded on a GPS and saved.  Thanks to Paul Lawson', 'UFO Landing Near Kirtland Air Force Base  Mystery Blonde Leaves Hair Behind -- But Who Was She? An abduction case from Australia has resulted in what may be the world\'s first DNA test of abduction-related biological material. The intriguing results raise many questions about the physical nature of abduction and also illustrate the need for more intensive scientific research on this worldwide mystery. The full case report by leading Australian researcher Bill Chalker was published in the Spring 1999 edition of International UFO Reporter, the quarterly journal of the Chicago-based J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). The following summary is published with Chalker\'s permission and assistance. Peter Khoury, the subject of this case, was born in Lebanon in 1964 and moved to Australia in 1973. There he met his future wife Vivian at school in 1981. Peter and Vivian were married in 1990 and now have two children. They live in Sydney. Peter works in the building trades and has owned his own business in cement rendering. Peter and Vivian had their first UFO experience in February 1988, a simple sighting of unusual moving lights. But in July of that year, Peter had a deeply disturbing, consciously remembered contact experience that, he says, changed his life. While lying on his bed, he felt something grab his ankles. He suddenly felt numb and paralyzed, but remained conscious. Then he noticed three or four small hooded figures alongside the bed. He experienced telepathic communication with one or more of these beings; he was told to relax and not be afraid because 'it would be like last time.' He then saw that they were about to insert a long needle into the side of his head, whereupon he blacked out. He jolted awake some time later, leaped out of bed and ran into the living room where he found his father and brother apparently dozing. Both he and his brother felt that only 10 minutes had passed since they had last been awake, but they soon realized that an hour or more had passed. The next morning, Peter and Vivian noticed that there was an obvious puncture mark on the side of his head, with a trace of dried blood. At this time, Peter had never heard of alien abduction. His memories were vivid and alarming, but he could find neither answers nor comfort from friends and acquaintances. Then, some months later, he and Vivian drove by a roadside billboard with an image of Whitley Strieber\'s book 'Communion,' and they immediately got the book. Peter found numerous details in Strieber\'s account that matched his own strange experience. Peter\'s subsequent attempts to connect with local UFO groups and experiencers proved frustrating. Eventually, in April 1993, he resolved to found a new group in Sydney, the UFO Experience Support Association (UFOESA), dedicated to helping people understand and cope with their unusual encounters. He remains the coordinator of that group today. In July 1992, Peter had the experience that became the focus of this case study. Because the experience had disturbing sexual aspects, Peter was very reticent to talk about it. He first mentioned it to Bill Chalker, one of Australia\'s leading researchers, in 1996. He showed Chalker that he had recovered an unusual strand of hair from the encounter. At the time, Chalker felt he could not do anything with the physical evidence, but over the next several years, he assembled a group of scientists and forensic investigators willing to work on UFO-related cases. With his 'invisible college' associates, Chalker discussed the possibility of doing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of mitochondrial DNA that might be recovered from Peter Khoury\'s hair sample. In early 1998, these researchers -- now calling themselves the Anomaly Physical Evidence Group -- agreed to do the DNA testing on the hair sample. Chalker points out that 'alien' beings are most often described by experiencers as having no visible hair. But one type -- sometimes called 'Nordic' -- is described fairly often as having distinctly human-like features including hair, often (though not always) blond in color. A number of well-known abduction cases have involved human-looking beings with hair, including the 1975 abduction reported by Travis Walton in Arizona, and the 1957 Brazilian abduction reported by Antonio Villas Boas. Peter Khoury\'s case has some similarity to that of Villas Boas, who said he was forced to have sex with an aggressive humanoid female aboard a landed UFO. Khoury told Chalker that his encounter of July 23, 1992 began at 7:30 in the morning while he was in bed. He had recently been injured at work and was taking pain medication. Earlier that morning, he had driven his wife to work, then returned home and went back to bed for a short while. Suddenly, he bolted wide awake and sat up. There were two humanoid females sitting on the bed, both entirely naked. These two women looked human in nearly every way. They had well proportioned adult bodies. One looked somewhat Asian, with straight dark shoulder-length hair and dark eyes. The other looked perhaps Scandinavian, with light-colored ('maybe bluish') eyes and long blond hair that fell half-way down her back. Her hair was especially notable to Peter Khoury. 'I had never seen a hair style like that. It was curled something like Farrah Fawcett, but to an extreme... It just looked really exotic in a way,' he told Chalker. But Khoury felt that these women were not exactly human. Their faces were somewhat odd -- not unattractive, but too chiseled, with very high cheekbones and eyes that were two or three times larger than normal. Khoury took special notice of the blonde. Her face was too long, he felt. 'I have never seen a human looking like that,' he said. The blonde, who was sitting in a kneeling position on the bed, seemed to be in charge. Khoury thought she was communicating telepathically with the dark-haired woman, who was sitting with her legs partly folded under her. There was something stiff, almost blank, in the expressions of the women, Khoury thought. Though stunned by the sudden appearance of the women, Khoury had only a few moments to consider how they could possibly have arrived in his bedroom before the blonde reached out with both her hands and cupped the back of his head, drawing his face toward her chest. He resisted. She pulled harder. He kept pulling back. 'She was pretty strong,' he told Chalker. 'She pulled me over and my mouth was basically on her nipple. And I bit.' Khoury said he doesn\'t know why he bit the woman, but even though he felt a small piece of her nipple come away in his teeth, she did not cry out. But 'the expression on her face was like, \'this isn\'t the way.\' In a way it was shock or confusion... She looked at the Asian one... and looked at me like, this isn\'t the way it\'s supposed to happen. You\'ve done this wrong.' Involuntarily, Khoury swallowed the small fragment in his mouth, and it caught in his throat. He went into a coughing fit. Suddenly, the two women simply disappeared. Once he realized the women were gone, he tried to clear his throat by drinking water. It didn\'t work. Then he had an urge to go to the bathroom. He realized that his penis felt very painful. Standing in the bathroom, he pulled back the foreskin and found two thin blond strands of hair wrapped tightly around. He struggled to unravel the pieces of hair as the pain became an intense burning sensation. Finally he managed to removed the two pieces of hair and immediately put them in a small sealable plastic bag. 'The reason I did that was because I knew that there was no way, no way at all, that a hair that size and wrapped around the way it was should have been there.... Thinking of these women, the thing in my throat, the hair, something bizarre had just happened.' Khoury resolved to keep the hair sample in case it should ever prove useful in shedding light on his experiences. The thing in Khoury\'s throat stayed there for three days. He coughed constantly. He tried clearing his throat with water, bread, anything he could think of, but nothing helped. On the third day, the feeling in his throat just went away. He did not want to tell his wife how his coughing fit had come about, but two weeks later he decided to tell her. 'I was shocked,' he told Chalker. 'She accepted it better than I did.' The pieces of hair, carefully stored away since the encounter, became the subject of the first openly-reported scientific DNA test on a possible abduction-related sample. The blond hairs were extremely thin and almost clear in color. It was determined that the hair was not chemically treated, because if it had been, little or no mitochondrial DNA could have been recovered. However, using the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) process, good quality DNA was recovered. For comparison, samples were also taken of Peter Khoury\'s hair and that of his wife Vivian. DNA was successfully extracted from Peter\'s hair, but no usable DNA was recovered from Vivian\'s hair, possibly because of chemical treatment. After thorough testing of the hair samples, the scientists of the Anomaly Physical Evidence Group arrived at a startling conclusion. The thin blond hair, which appeared to have come from a light-skinned caucasian-type woman, could not have come from a normal human of that racial type. Instead, though human, the hair showed five distinctive DNA markers that are characteristic of a rare sub-group of the Chinese Mongoloid racial type. A detailed survey of the literature on variations in mitochondrial DNA, comprising tens of thousands of samples, showed only four other people on record with all five of the distinctive markers in the blond hair. All four were Chinese, with black hair. Mitochondrial DNA is passed only from mother to child and therefore offers a means of tracing ancient ancestry on the mother\'s side. The findings suggest that all four of the Chinese subjects share a common female ancestor with the blonde woman. But there is no easy explanation for how this could be. Testing for nuclear DNA, if such could be recovered from the blond hair, would be more complex and expensive than the tests run so far, but might show that the lineage of the blonde\'s father was even stranger than that of her mother. But such testing must await funding that has yet to be found. So far, the members of the Anomaly Physical Evidence Group have financed all their work themselves. Without the blond hair sample, the story told by Peter Khoury is but one more in an almost endless sequence of wrenching, but unprovable, abduction accounts. The hair, however, changes everything. It undeniably exists, and thorough forensic testing shows that it is anomalous. It seems likely that no person with blond hair and an exact DNA match to Khoury\'s blonde could be found in the city of Sydney, nor on the continent of Australia, nor -- probably -- anywhere in the world. Who then was the being whose blond hair inexplicably became wrapped around Peter Khoury\'s penis? 'Are we dealing with \'humans\' from elsewhere, namely those with human DNA, albeit very rare and somewhat anomolous?' asks Bill Chalker. 'This case raises all sorts of issues, such as human \'panspermia\'' -- the theory that human-like beings may have migrated to Earth in the fairly recent past from elsewhere in the galaxy, perhaps giving rise to the sudden appearance of modern homo sapiens sapiens, a species not directly descended from their immediate predecessors, the Neanderthals. 'Also, given the Asian mongoloid connection, we looked at the problem of European-like rare Asian types in the past,' Chalker says. 'The controversial saga of the Taklamakan mummies in remote Western China is turning the early history of China on its head. These mummies include people who are quite tall, some 6 feet or so, and some are blond. I\'m not suggesting a connection here, but you can understand this investigation has opened up all sorts of interesting possibilities about the biological nature of some of the beings implicated in abduction cases.' These questions will not be easy to answer. But supporting the work of the Anomaly Physical Evidence Group could help.

(B J Booth)Albany, NY Fox TV UFO CasePeter Davenport, Director, National UFO Reporting CenterExpert Certifies Object Genuine... Preliminary NUFORC statement regarding the footage captured by FOX 23 television in Albany, NY, on Sunday, October 20, 2002.At 07:30 hrs. (Pacific) on Monday morning, October 21, 2002, the National UFO Reporting Center received a telephone call from a television news reporter, Mr. Dan Bazile, with FOX 23 news (a Clear Channel Communication-owned station), who apprised us that one of their photographers had inadvertently captured brief footage of a very bizarre object streaking across the sky near Albany, NY.He described that one of their photographers had been out on Sunday afternoon, October 20th, photographing aircraft at a nearby airport, and that the peculiar object had been detected in the news studio when the footage was being examined at slow speed.From that first telephone conversation, NUFORC was not left with a clear understanding of the nature of the object and its appearance, but Mr. Bazile offered to forward to NUFORC still images from the tape. NUFORC offered to help identify the object, if possible, and to put the station in touch with photo analysts, who might be able to assist in further analysis.In a second conversation with Mr. Bazile on Tuesday morning, October 22, he apprised NUFORC that the original video tape of the object had been forcibly 'confiscated' from the 'young photographer' by 'four FBI agents,' from the Albany, NY, FBI offices, a statement which now is in question. {or had been changed, B J} p> Mr. Bazile went on to describe how the agents had invited the photographer outside the station, and that the agents had then 'taken' the 'original' tape from the photographer, who had it on his person at the time of the meeting with the FBI personnel.When NUFORC suggested that such an act, in the absence of a court warrant, might be illegal, Mr. Bazile averred that he agreed with that assessment.However, he stated that the station still had in its possession several copies of the original tape.{Shortly after these events, I received my first report of this event. I was told that the video was briefly on the Fox 23 News station, but had been removed. This certainly got my attention.The video had made it\'s way to www.rense.com, and I tried to download it, which I did, but the file would not play. I subsequently received the video file from one of my sources, and immediately uploaded it to my domain in two formats, quicktime and real.When NUFORC asked Mr. Bazile whether FOX 23 was planning to do a news report on the incident with the FBI, he responded that the station was 'considering' that possibility, but such a decision was out of his hands.He then stated that in order to answer that question, he would like first to speak with his 'supervisor' about the matter, and that he would call back 'in a few minutes.'After approximately 45 minutes had elapsed, NUFORC telephoned FOX 23 and requested to be put in touch with Mr. Bazile. After a short period of time, he came on the line, but after only a very short conversation he said he would like to put his supervisor, Mr. Dave Brown, Station News Director for FOX 23, on the line.During our 7-minute conversation with Mr. Brown, he stated that a copy of the tape had been provided to the personnel from the FBI by his station voluntarily, because his station 'willingly co-operated with members of law enforcement.' He added that he personally had provided the video to the FBI, that it had not been 'taken' by them, as had been suggested by Mr. Bazile. Mr. Brown stated that he had arrived at work on Sunday evening 'at about 8 or 9 o\'clock,' and that FBI personnel had been photographed in the station while they watched the tape, and that that footage had been aired by the station on Sunday night as a news report. Mr. Brown implied that this fact illustrated that there had been no 'mystery' surrounding the FBI\'s interest in the footage, and that, in his opinion, no impropriety surrounded the transfer of the tape to the FBI personnel.{I received the information on this video from one of my sources late on the 21st of October. Since then, I have done everything I could to find the video. This was the first post made on the event at the Fox 23 News.}ALBANY -- FOX TV News reported on October 21, 2002, that a spear shaped object was caught on film passing above Albany International Airport during daylight hours as a commercial aircraft landed at the airport. The spear shaped object was moving at high speed and could be mistaken for a missile, but none was known to have crashed. The FBI is attempting to determine the cause of the video sighting.When I saw the acronym FBI, I knew the information would be squashed. I ran a site search for more information and got this message:Overwhelming demand has crashed our video servers, so in the meantime here are stills from that video.If you sign up for FOX23 eNews Breaking News, an e-mail will be sent out as soon as video has been restored to our website.I followed their suggestion, and signed up on 10-22, so far nothing as of 10-26, 2:20 PM CDT.I also sent a request via email to the station news manager, so far no reply.Peter Davenport... cont\'dMr. Brown also added that he did not know whether the original tape had been provided to the FBI, or whether they had received a copy. However, he said that with digital tape, it really did not matter, since very little fidelity was lost in a copied tape.When asked how many representatives from the FBI had been present at the station on Sunday night, he said that he did not know, but there were at least two representatives from that office present.He said there might have been more, but he could not be certain, since 'there were so many people present in the station that night.'Mr. Brown closed the conversation with the statement that FOX 23 would not be devoting any more news coverage to the footage, suggesting that the story was now old news, and that, in his opinion, it did not warrant any further attention by his station.Following our conversation with Mr. Brown, NUFORC contacted the FBI offices in Albany [(518) 465-7551]. We spoke with Lisa Massaroni, a public affairs spokeswoman, who apprised us that to the best of her knowledge, the FBI office did have a copy of the tape, that their personnel were planning to analyze it, but that she did not know the status of the investigation.She directed us to her supervisor for any further questions, and added that he would be out of his office until October 24th.NUFORC also was contacted by a gentleman from Birmingham, AL, Mr. Brian Huff, a forensic video analyst, who had captured the video from the FOX 23 website, and who has analyzed the tape. We provide elements of his video analysis with this statement.Mr. Huff has stated to NUFORC that, based on his analysis of the footage, the object is genuine, and that it is not a superimposed image. He also stated that the object is on the other side of the clouds, which provides some perspective as to the size of the object, and its velocity, which Mr. Huff concludes is considerable.We extend our gratitude to Mr. Huff for sharing his analysis with NUFORC and Jeff Rense.Prepared by Peter B.

AUTHORITIES WILL CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THE VIDEO TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FLYING OBJECT IS. WE\'LL KEEP YOU POSTED', 'Kentucky Train Collision with Disk UFO, 2002Paintsville, Kentucky -- At exactly 2:47 a.m. on January 14, 2002, while working a coal train enroute from Russell, Kentucky to Shelbiana, Kentucky, our trailing unit and first two cars were severely damaged as we struck an unknown floating or hovering object. I know it was 2:47 because my watch froze, and to this day shows that time. Along with my watch the entire electrical systems on both locomotives went haywire. Approaching a bend near milepost 42 in an area referred to as the Wild Kingdom, for the many different types of animals spotted there, my conductor and I saw lights coming from around the way. This ordinarily means another train is coming and will pass on the other track. The outlay of the area is this, the river, #1 track, #2 tracks and a straight up mountainside, carved out for the laying of these tracks. I killed our lights as not to blind the oncoming crew. As we rounded the corner our onboard computer began to flash in and out, speed recorder went nuts, and both locomotives died. Alarm bells began to ring and that’s when we saw the objects. Apparently scanning the river for something. At least three objects had several 'search' lights trained there, the first object hovered about 10 to 12 feet above the track.  It was metallic silver in color with multiple colored lights near the bottom and in the middle. There were no windows or openings of any kind that we could see. It was 18 to 20 feet in length and probably ten feet high. With both engines dead as we rounded the corner we made little noise and the first object did not respond in time, I estimate that we hit the object at 30 mph with 16,000 trailing tons behind us. It clipped the top of our lead unit then skipped back slicing a chunk out of our trailing unit and first two coal cars. The other objects vanished. Our emergency brakes had initiated due to the loss of power and we stopped approximately a mile and a half to two miles after impact. Our power restored after we were stopped and we notified our dispatcher, located in Jacksonville, Florida of what had happened. We were told to inspect the cars to see if they\'d hold the rail and try to limp into milepost cmg 60 which used to be the Paintsville yard which is no longer in full operation. We checked everything out and the cab of the rear locomotive was demolished and smoking, the second two cars looked as if they had been hit with a giant hammer, but looked like they\'d hold the rail.  We pulled into Paintsville yard at approximately 5:15 am. The huge overhead lights lining the yard were noticeably dark and the only lights came from what we assumed were railroad officials vehicles parked near the end of the track. We pulled to a stop and began unloading our grips off the wounded train. We could hear what sounded like an army of workers immediately tending to our train. Vehicle doors slamming, guys running by in weird outfits and lights glaring from all directions, the one thing missing was railroad officials. A guy named Ferguson shook my hand and asked me to follow him into the old yard office. We did, once inside they, and by they I mean I have no idea who these people were, began to ask us hundreds of questions, they then told us for our own protection we\'d be medically tested before we could leave. I asked repeatedly to talk to my road foreman or trainmaster and not only were these requests denied but they confiscated my conductor’s cellular phone. Hours later we were led outside the old yard office and the strange things continued to happen, the 2 locomotives and two cars were removed from the rest of the train we had brought in and my only guess was parked 4 tracks over under a huge tent like structure buzzing with activity. We were led off the property and told, due to national security, our silence on this matter would be appreciated. We were then put in a railroad vehicle and taken to Martin, Kentucky were we went through questioning again with railroad officials and were then drug tested. After all of this we were sent on to Shelbiana, where we took rest for 8 hours and worked another train back to Russell. Working back we passed by Paintsville, no sign of the engines, cars, tent, people, nothing.

The sighting occurred on October 5, 2002 at 16:49 hours. The witness states that: I took four pictures of the mountains to the west of Las Cruces, NM. The camera was a Canon G2 digital. The last shot taken at 4:49 pm was enlarged after downloading to a computer. Only then were the images of 2 objects noticed in the sky. One in the upper left was disk-shaped and appeared metallic in luster. A second object, below and to the right of the first, was apparently much smaller and/or further away. A previous shot taken 2 minutes earlier showed no objects. source:National UFO Reporting Center Sighting Report http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25455.html', ' Investigator Comments 'Whatever this object was, it generated havoc throughout the campground,' said the officer. 'People were coming to the gate asking what it was.' When asked if there were any animal reaction to the object, he said that all kinds of dogs were around the area but they did not behave unusual during the episode. Thomas said the staff in the area had been \'on edge\' due to a helicopter crash around three weeks earlier Thomas acknowledges that he is the source for the \'helicopter\' speculation. 'As far as a a helicopter explanation was concerned, that was an assumption made by me because I was the only emergency personnel to see this,' he said. not confident that this was a helicopter 'But I\'m honestly not sure what it was, I would not put any money on this being a helicopter.' He said that he would not surprised if there were other reports on this object. He was aware of reports generated near the Oxford airport, which is directly due east of the campground. 'Our dispatch was calling for an officer to investigate area for low flying unidentified flying object,' he said, 'and I think it was called in from Butler County, Ohio.' When told that another police agency offered the possibility that this was a star cluster, he said: 'this absolutely represented nothing of a star cluster.'

The sighting reportedly occurred on Sunday, October 20, 2002, near Tyrone, PA in Blair County. The man forwarded details concerning his experience, as well as two color photographs that he took of the object before it departed.The witness indicated that he had also forwarded this material to the National UFO Reporting Center.The witness is very concerned about being ridiculed, and requests not to be identified. Due to his concerns, my only communication with the witness has been via email. He has responded to my request for additional details concerning his observation.Due to computer problems, I am unable to post the photographs at this time. I have talked with Peter Davenport at the National UFO Reporting Center, who is expected to post the pictures as soon as he completes his sighting report updates.Sighting report narrative:The witness was hiking in the woods on Ice Mountain near the town of Tyrone. The man had stayed out longer than he expected that day. He estimated that it was about 7:30 P.M. (local time) as he was walking back to his vehicle, when he noticed a bright light south of his location, moving towards him in a northerly direction. His first impression was that it was an airplane.The light appeared similar to the brightness of a normal aircraft light when first observed. He then noticed that the light suddenly stopped, then began to pulsate and appear to brighten and dim. The witness then noticed a faint haze that was orange-red in color, and which encircled the object.The pulsation pattern of the light began to increase, and it started to flicker very rapidly. The light became much brighter as it pulsated. Suddenly a thin beam of very bright blue-white light was emitted from the bottom of the object to the ground.The witness points out that this was not an ordinary searchlight.The witness stated, 'This was no searchlight. Even a well focused searchlight tends to diffuse with distance, but this light was a tight, bright beam from top to bottom.' The man tried to describe the appearance of the beam with the following statement. 'Imagine a piece of dental floss held at arms length, and you\'ll have a good idea of the beam\'s apparent width from my location.'The witness said that the pulsating effect suddenly stopped, and the beam of light went out. The observer commented, 'As far as the form, I couldn\'t see any craft or object per se, just the bright light itself and the beam that came down from it, as it was pretty dark at the time.' The object at first appeared to be circular in shape and orange-red in color. When the object stopped moving and began pulsating it seemed more oval or egg shaped.The object continued to hover in the sky, and the witness ran to his vehicle which was about 100 yards away, to get his Olympus digital camera. The witness took one photograph as the object hovered, then a second picture was obtained just as the object was beginning to move around slowly in a tight circle. As the man prepared to take a third picture, the object, 'suddenly shot straight up in the air at fantastic speed and was gone from sight.'The sky conditions at the time of observation were described as partly cloudy. The witness did not detect any sound, or odd smells during the sighting. The witness estimates the total incident lasted about 5 minutes or less.The witness commented that at the location where the light beam appeared to meet the ground, he estimated that he was about 1/4 mile away, or farther from the object, and that it was about 1,000 feet in altitude. The witness also mentioned that there is a large microwave relay tower at the top of the mountain, and, 'the beam appeared to be hitting the ground close to the tower.' The man couldn\'t see the exact spot where the beam hit.In closing, the witness had these comments to make. 'I don\'t know what this thing was, but I know I\'ve never seen anything like it before.' and 'If anyone else saw this object, please let me know. If for no other reason, so I can stop questioning my sanity.' source:Researcher: Stan Gordon'

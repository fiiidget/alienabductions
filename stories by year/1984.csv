1984,1984 - Italy -The Isidoro Ferri EncounterPublished: 3:56 PM 2/2/2007October 9, 1984, Polcanto, Firenze, ItalyOn October 9, or 29, 1984, at 03:30 AM, Isidoro Ferri, a doorman at the Villa la Radicchia, in Polcanto, close to Florence, Italy, was normally sleeping with his son and other relatives in his bedroom when he was awakened by a strong light on his face. Initially, he did not understand the origin of the light, then, in a few moments, he saw that it came from an individual of humanoid appearance at a distance of approximately 40 meters, apparently on a nearby hill, who had some sort of powerful flashlight or beacon on the head. It is not specified whether Ferri was still in bed in the house, outside, or at the window at that time. Ferri first thought it was a poacher, but suddenly he changed his mind, as the figure disappeared in a fog or in a blur, or gave place, to a dark horizontal line, under which three flames went down towards the ground. Other summaries indicate it was some sort of luminous cupola looking like 'fire', which searched the area with beams of light, replaced suddenly after a few minutes, and an enormous blinding white light that started to approach, illuminating the entire area as in full daylight. Some sources say the witness tried to approach the window, but he remained paralyzed before he arrived there, until the light seemed sucked back. One source indicates he was paralyzed by fear. A red sphere then appeared, which had an intermittent light that hurt the witness\' eyes, and he had red and irritated eyes for several days. This glowing red sphere is said to have disappeared behind the hills in the direction of Vaglia. The dog, who slept outside, had not barked. He showed an abnormal behavior by refusing any food for several days and by staying inside its doghouse during the two next weeks, without barking after passers-by. In the surroundings, three circular holes of 10 centimeters diameter and 3 centimeters depth forming an irregular triangle of 2 meters of side approximately, were discovered, where the grass seemed to have undergone a pressure, but no radioactivity was detected. An investigation report into this case was written by Pier Luigi Sani. A newspaper recalls that the witness appeared in one TV interview with the Ministry of Defense, and policemen and other people insisted his testimony was in good faith; some source say that other people saw a red light in the sky that night. The author indicates that the most complete investigation report into this case is that of Pier Luigi Sani. ', ' Incident at Indian Point Reactor Complex, N. Y. 1984                The threat of UFOs compromising reactor security, asif the nuclear industry didn\'t have enough to deal withalready, became a very real concern in 1984. Although of-ficials won\'t admit it, several researchers have information ThatNew York\'s Indian Point Reactor complex endured sucha UFO problem during the long siege of sightings thathappened throughout the state\'s Hudson Valley area.The portrayal of the event in this article is based primarily onthe disclosures of unnamed sources.   The summer of 1984 was a troublesome season forauthorities at the Indian Point nuclear reactor complex inBuchanan, New York. Two UFO appearances, one of which was verifiedby Carl Patrick, director of nuclear information for the New YorkPower Authority (NYPA), and later documented by the press and the1987 book Night Siege, apparently put the normally tight securityof the plant to a severe test. The first event entailed the briefflyover of a huge craft, witnessed by three security policemen onJune 14. That was followed ten days later by a UFO incident ofunprecedented impact. It was one of hundreds of UFO sightings inthe Hudson Valley, but one the nuclear workers won\'t soon forget.   'Here comes that UFO again!' an Indian Point security guard issaid to have yelled on the night of July 24, 1984, alerting othersecurity personnel by way of the plant\'s internalcommunications system. A UFO, variously described as looking like 'an ice cream cone' and 'boomerang,' had lazily drifted overto Reactor #3-the only active reactor at the time-lingering about300 feet above the domed construction for some ten minutes, sendingsecurity officials into an uproar. Now, six years later, theprincipal UFO researcher on the case admits that many aspects ofthe event remain confusing and undisclosed. And although he\'s stillreceiving information, Philip Imbrogno calls his own lengthyinvestigation 'stagnant.'    'Every time new information comes up or I get a lead onsomething, I get very reluctant to deal with it again,' saidImbrogno, who heads the science department at the Windward Schoolin White Plains, New York. 'The entire case has caused me quite abit of pressure . . . The event would indicate that whateverappeared over there, our state-of-the-art technology in defense wasunable to deal with it.' He suggests that from what his sourceshave said, a military aspect came into play. The Indian Point UFOrepresented an intolerable security breach.Military customers?   Imbrogno says that it is precisely that aspect which has had alasting effect, and which has generated repercussions that continueto this day. But according to the New York Power Authority, whichoversees the reactor complex, Indian Point itself has no directmilitary customers. Reactor #3 primarily services local and statefacilities in New York City and Westchester County, including localschool districts, the New York City subway systems and some of NewYork\'s trains. Most importantly, in Imbrogno\'s mind, are severalmilitary installations in and around Duchess County, whichallegedly get their power from Indian Point. According to hissources, these are primarily satellite receiving stations, and 'anumber of other military operations of which we can only guess,'Imbrogno says. The official agency overseeing the reactor complexis the New York Power Authority, although Consolidated Edison hasjurisdiction over Reactor #2 and is sold use of #3 for extensivetransmissions to New York residential users and, perhaps, militaryfacilities such as Camp Smith, an Air National Guard base locatednorth of Peekskill. (Reactor #l is inactive.)  It was NYPA whose officials apparently spent considerable humanenergy trying to dissuade Imbrogno from writing about the July 24event, concerned he would release information vital to the plant\'ssecurity. 'I think other agencies were using (the NYPA) to harassme,' he said, noting that he was constantly subjected to theirrepetitive phone calls, threatening that he would be forced toappear at a hearing on the incident. (He was never subpoenaed, butImbrogno subsequently, and perhaps coincidentally, was audited bythe IRS four times.)The compulsion to publish was undeniable; of what may have beenas many as 70 UFO witnesses among Indian Point personnel, a numberquietly sought out Imbrogno, and on the condition of anonymityprovided him with the vital facts which led to the production ofNight Siege (co-written with Bob Pratt and J. Allen Hynek.)'Mysources involve people who work in security for the plant and alsopeople in secretarial and janitorial positions,' he said.                                 'The only problem is that getting anything on paper-documentation, something official-is very, very hard, I haveunofficial confirmation right now that a number of documentspertaining to the sighting do exist at the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission.' Normally, NRC records can be opened to the publicunder terms of the Freedom of Information Act, but when he in-quired, Imbrogno was informed that the documents were being held atthe reactor complex, and as such were protected under nationalsecurity regulations. 'It\'s a joint sort of thing,' he said, 'Inother words, although the NRC is pretty open to the public, if they want to keep a document classified, they\'ll store it with anotheragency. I have an inside secretarial source who\'s actually seen thedocuments filed.'The NYPA\'s Patrick denies that any such documentation exists, and dismisses the incident by claiming thatall Hudson Valley UFO sightings were later identified as lightaircraft. There was no videotape taken by on-site surveillancecameras, Patrick insists, or audio recording of oral communications, both pieces of evidence which Imbrogno stronglyfeels do exist and are being retained somewhere. According toImbrogno\'s sources, a security shake-up ensued the very next day.'A number of agencies came in, including the NRC and militarypersonnel, and they supposedly cleaned out everything. You have toremember that with nuclear reactors, you\'re only going to get 10percent of the real story. They\'re overly terrified of badpublicity, and are really afraid of the anti-nuclear groups, whichcan cause trouble. Anything that happens is immediately covered up,including UFO sightings.'An \'irregularity\'  Imbrogno further alleges that shortly after the UFO infringement,a crack in the reactor\'s casing was discovered. The public didn\'thear about such a situation until a year later; the NYPA\'s Patrickdenied any 'crack,' although he did recall a time when Reactor #2may have developed an 'irregularity.' Imbrogno says, '[IndianPoint officials] made a public statement that operations were notaffected, that everything was normal. But I\'ve been told by severalpeople that they lost power, the security system dropped, and thereactor controls went crazy. Apparently it was caused by the UFO.'No way, says the NYPA.  'Any implication that the sightings ofthese [light aircraft] in any way affected Reactor #3 is false',Patrick said. Imbrogno\'s sources indicate otherwise. Supposedly, amass of sophisticated, high-accuracy tracking equipment wasinstalled at the complex, enabling security to quickly generate acomputer image of whatever aircraft might be affecting theequipment. Apparently such problems are still going on. Patrickwould not comment on what kinds of security equipment protectIndian Point, but stressed that nothing new has been installedsince the incident.  Imbrogno is also suspicious that the armed security forces at thesite may have had reason to attempt firing on the craft, again anallegation flatly refuted by the NYPA. 'I know a number ofhelicopters with rocket launchers were sent up and followed thecraft for some distance,' Imbrogno commented, citing his anonymoussources for the info. 'When these helicopters went on their way,the object moved off and started crossing the Hudson, anddisappeared up north.'  Officials will not talk to Imbrogno, nor answer his letters, hesays. UFO spoke with Cliff Spieler, vice president at the New YorkPower Authority. He, like Patrick, basically dismisses the entireaffair. 'Having looked into this thing and living two miles fromIndian Point, think the UFO reports are nonsense,' he said. 'AllHudson Valley UFO sightings] are linked to small planes flying outof Duchess County.'    At one time, officials speaking for Indian Point made theirposition quite clear to Imbrogno, 'They said, \'you can cooperatewith us, or you don\'t have to cooperate with us. If you don\'tcooperate with us, you have to face the consequences, because youare dealing in an area of national security. The incident that tookplace over there involved national security because it was a breachof security at a nuclear reactor.\' But they weren\'t ready to saywho was breaching security!' In considering the 'who,' Imbrognotook in a number of hypotheses, including the possibility that theincident was an elaborate test flight of a secret military craft,such as the B-2 Stealth bomber, or a covertly-planned contingencytest of the plant\'s security operations, carried out under theguise of a UFO overflight.  Nothing is impossible, he\'ll admit. But the most tenable answer,he feels, is that the UFO was an extraterrestrial craft. 'I don\'tthink our government could be so bold with a craft of the kind thatappeared at Indian Point,' he said.  'Talking to these securitypeople, and looking into their eyes,' his voice trailed,' . . . they tell a story of this one cop who got up on the roof belowthe UFO, and the thing started moving a little bit. He pulled outhis gun, looked at it, then put the gun back in his holster andducked! The people who were telling these stories are notfamiliar with the UFO literature. If I really wanted to go intothis, with no fear of what would happen to me, I\'m sure there\'s anincredible story here. I am still being giveninformation about certain things going on there-In the nighttime,people seeing little creatures coming through the walls of thecasing on the reactor, and military personnel indicating \'we\'reaware of these creatures and we don\'t care if they\'re from outerspace-shoot \'em!\' On a newscast on Channel 7 in New York,they were interviewing one guy, and he said, \'I saw it going overthe reactor! I think they\'re sucking the power from it! That\'s whatthey\'re doing!\' But a civilization that has this type of vehicle-any intelligence, whatever it is-I\'m sure doesn\'t need nuclearenergy.' Editor\'s Note: In a letter to UFO shortly after this article waswritten, Imbrogno added to his remarks.  'It is hard to believethat people like John Lear and Bill Cooper are revealing \'topsecret\' information with little or no repercussions. I just pokedmy nose a little too deep into an area of national security and gotmy ears pinned back for it. My next step is to approach this in alegal way by asking for an investigation (preferably by a member ofCongress) to find out how and why the security at thisgovernment reactor was violated and why information is beingwithheld.'source:This file was provided to the ParaNet Information Service byUFO Magazine.

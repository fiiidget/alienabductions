Air Force Leaders began looking for possible sites for air bases in the northern United States. The city of Minot sold the Air Force on becoming a site for a new base in 1954. The following year Minot businessmen and citizens donated approximately $50,000 to buy the first portions of land for the base. The ground breaking took place July 12, 1955, and construction started shortly after.The base started out as a Air Defense Command (ADC) Base and the first unit was the 32d Fighter Group, activated on Feb. 7, 1957. The Air Force took up occupancy eight days later on Feb. 15. There was a small ceremony in front of base Ops when the Army Corp. of Engineers officer turned over the key to the base to the first base commander Major Joe E. Roberts. Personnel celebrated the first church service in July 1958, and the Base Exchange opened in Sept. 1958. That same year, Air Defense Command established a Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) sector at Minot AFB, it was construction of a huge, windowless blast-resistant concrete building. IBM engineers installed two large, 275-ton computers in the basement of the building.Activated in June 1961, the SAGE facility processed air surveillance information and sent the data to Air Defense Command units.The first permanent Strategic Air Command (SAC) unit assigned to Minot AFB was the 4136th Strategic Wing in September 1958 and within six months, the 906th Air Refueling Squadron was activated and assigned to the 4136th. They provided air refueling support to northern defense operations. The first KC-135A Stratotanker, dubbed 'Miss Minot,' arrived September 23, 1959. In addition, there was one U-2 aircraft stationed on base for 18 months as part of 'Operation CROWFLIGHT.'In late January 1960, the 32d Fighter Group brought the first F-106 Delta Dart to Minot. The F106\'s were assigned to the 5th Fighter Interceptor Squadron (FIS) which was transferred to Minot from Suffolk County Airport, New York on February 1, 1960. An interesting thing about the Fifth, was their mascots, two live lynx kittens that produced several offspring which were kept on base. The scope of operations grew as the Air Force assigned the 525th Bombardment Squadron to the 4136th. In July 1961, the first B-52H Stratofortress, named 'Peace Persuader,' arrived on base and within five months the base received its first Hound Dog Missile to give the B-52 its first stand-off capabilityAlso in 1961, the Air Force selected the land around Minot for a new Minuteman I Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) complex. Field construction began on the missile complex in January 1962. SAC activated the 455th Strategic Missile Wing (SMW) in November 1962, and in less than a year, on September 9, 1963, the first Minuteman I Missile arrived from Hill AFB, Utah. It was placed in Launch Facility A-02, September 9, 1963. Within a short 28 months, in April 1964, the 455th became combat ready. The amber waves of grain over the North Dakota plains were implanted with a combat ready ICBM system born of the latest American technology.As SAC’s mission continued to grow at Minot, ownership passed from ADC to SAC. As Minot\'s mission changed, the SAGE center was deactivated in May 1963 and eventually housed numerous base agencies and today is known as the Professional Results In Daily Endeavors (PRIDE) Building.Minot AFB\'s organizational makeup changed in mid-1968, when the 91st Strategic Missile Wing replaced the 455th Strategic Missile Wing, and the 5th Bombardment Wing (BMW) replaced the 450th Bombardment Wing. These changes were in line with Air Force policy in keeping active those units with the most illustrious histories. Force modernization characterized Minot AFB during the 1970s. The Air Force selected the 91 SMW to become the first wing to convert to the Minuteman III ICBM. The Minuteman III tripled the striking power and enhanced the credibility of the SAC deterrent force. The 741st Strategic Missile Squadron became the first operational Minuteman III squadron in December 1970, and the entire wing converted by December 1971. The 5 BMW added the Short Range Attack Missile (SRAM) to its arsenal in September 1973, and later equipped its bombers with an improved offensive avionics system for more accurate bombing.Following the 1980 Iran hostage crisis, SAC tasked the 57th Air Division (AD), which had been on base since the mid 70\'s, to organize the Strategic Projection Force (SRF). The 57 AD became the first division in SAC to implement this concept. The 5 BMW\'s B-52H fleet became the spearhead of this force, able to provide conventional warfare anywhere in the world. In the late 1980\'s the 57 AD became the host unit, providing logistical, security, administrative and other support services to the 5 BMW, 91 SMW and tenant organizations.In the mid 80\'s the 5th Fighter Interceptor Squadron converted from the F-106 to the F-15 Eagles. The F-15s only flew over Minot until the spring of 1988, when the 5 FIS was deactivated. After the unit inactivated, their mascots, two of the lynx kittens were donated to the Roosevelt Park Zoo in Minot, where they\'re still living today. In 1988, the Air Force selected Minot AFB for the Commander-in-Chief\'s Installation Excellence Award. This presidential award recognizes those military installations that combine mission excellence with a concern for people to produce working and living conditions truly above other installations. Closing out the 1980s Minot continued to answer America\'s strategic needs. Rivet MILE, the Minuteman Integrated Life Extension program, is a nine-year modification program for missile support systems and facilities. It will maintain the Minuteman III as an effective deterrent into the next century. The 5 BMW continued to modernize in October 1989, when they added the Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) to their arsenal.Entering the 1990s, Minot AFB demonstrated its war-fighting capabilities by deploying aircraft and personnel to the Middle East for the overwhelming victory over Iraq during Operation DESERT STORM. After the war, the base prepared for changes as the Air Force directed a major reorganization. In June 1991, the 57th Air Division was inactivated and the 5th Bomb Wing (BW) assumed host base responsibilities. As the 'Cold War' came to an end, 5th Bomb Wing\'s aircraft came off alert status in September 1991, after 35 years of continuous alert.  In June 1992, the newly formed Air Combat Command (ACC) replaced Strategic Air Command (SAC) as host command. Both the 91st and 5th fell under the newly formed ACC. The following summer the 91st was reassigned to Air Force Space Command.The 5 BW gained the Advanced Cruise Missiles (ACM) for the B-52 in the spring of 1993. In January 1994, the base lost one of its oldest units, the 906th Air Refueling Squadron. The final KC-135 departed Minot three months later. The 91st Missile Wing (MW) completed its first major upgrade on the command, control, and communication systems of the Minuteman III ICBM’s launch and control centers in August 1996. They did it with the new Rapid Execution and Combat Targeting (REACT) upgrade program. The 91 MW continues to modernize their Missile Alert Facilities (MAF) through 'Alert Imaging.' A continuing event for the base is the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). Since the treaty went into force in late 1994, the base received eight inspections, four on the 91 MW and four on the 5 BW, the latest in October 1997. On October 1, 1997, the 91st Missile Wing was redesignated the 91st Space Wing (SW).Minot AFB has undergone many changes throughout the years, but one thing remains constant -- Team Minot spirit continues to reign, re-emphasizing the truth that 'Only the Best Come North.'', ' 1950, Dr. Botta Enters Flying SaucerMany reports of UFO encounters made by single individuals are often given little weight by most investigators. However, when that one person is of high esteem and credibility, the case is given much weight. Such is the case with an Alien encounter that occurred in 1950 in South America. The lone witness was Dr. Enrique Caretenuto Botta, who passed his incredible story on to Horacio Gonzales G. in Caracas at a UFO conference in 1955. Dr. Botta would soon give permission to Horacio G. to relate the story to famed UFO researcher Leon Stringfield. The researcher would release the details of the Botta encounter in his book, 'Situation Red.'At the time of the encounter, Dr. Botta was a man of 40 years old. He was well educated and respected by all who knew him. He was an ex-war pilot and aeronautical engineer. He was employed as an architectural engineer working with a well known company in Caracas in 1950. His job had placed him in Argentina working on a large construction project when he would be involved in the most bizarre event of his life. Botta was driving down the highway about seventy-five miles from his hotel in an isolated area known as Bahia Blanca when he saw a metallic, disc-shaped object sitting on the grass just off the road way. He stopped his car to watch the object for a few minutes to see what would happen. After seeing no sign of movement, he decided to get even closer to the unknown object. This vantage point allowed him to see an opening or doorway in the object\'s side. He decided to go inside. At first the craft\'s inside seemed empty, except for a blinking red light in a domed top. As he ventured farther inside, he saw a curved divan with four seats; three of these seats were occupied with small beings about four feet tall with gray, tight-fitting overalls. The three small creatures were facing a control panel. It consisted of lights, gauges, and meters of different types.Standing quietly behind them, Botta could not resist the urge to touch one of the small beings. As he did, he felt a rigid, charred texture. The three strange creatures were dead! All within a moment, he rushed from the saucer,  got into his car, and was speeding down the highway. Arriving at his hotel, he related his strange experience to two of his closest friends. The group of men armed themselves with weapons and decided to return to the scene of Botta\'s encounter. However, it being almost dark, and the area being so isolated, they changed their minds, and opted for the next morning to do their search.Early the next day, Botta led the three directly to the spot of the previous day\'s unusual encounter, but there was no craft there now. All that was found at the site the object had occupied was a pile of ashes. One of the men scooped some up. Immediately, his hand turned purple, and remained that way for several days. The three men, discouraged by the absence of the object, began to look around the area to see if any other evidence of its landing could be found. One of the men looked up and saw three objects in the sky. One, the largest of the three, was cigar-shaped, while the two smaller objects were disc-shaped. Dr. Botta hurriedly took five pictures of the objects, of which only two showed vague images of the objects. Soon, the two smaller objects joined the cigar-shaped flying object. The three became one, turned blood red, and quickly disappeared from view.Dr. Botta would later relate more details of his observations on the day of the incident. He would recall that he saw vents or holes in the floor of the object. The control panel had a transparent sphere above it which rotated. The rigidness of the aliens\' skin was an indication to him that they had died in a crash or malfunction. He also was amazed at the skin of the saucer, which was metallic in appearance, but had a 'rubbery' feel to it.Immediately after the encounter, Dr. Botta came down with a fever, and his skin was blistered.  Doctors were unable to discover the origin of either ailment. The symptoms lasted for several weeks. He also had an impression of the sunglasses he wore into the craft on his face. A test showed no sign of radiation. Botta kept the details of his strange encounter private, except for his two companions, Horacio Gonzales G., and Leon Stringfield. Although the details of the strange happenings in Argentina seem most improbable, the character and reputation of Botta make this case extremely difficult to discount.(B J Booth) source:Leon Stringfield, Situation Red, p. 80', 'GORDON COOPER & UFOs: AN ASTRONAUT SPEAKS OUT by Timothy Green Beckley 'One of the few individuals whose prominence is beyond question has, however, over the past few months, dared to open his mouth and challenge the status quo. Gordon Cooper was one of America\'s original astronauts. He helped pioneer this country\'s space exploration efforts when, aboard a tiny space capsule known as Mercury [Faith 7, Cooper orbited the Earth for 34 hours, proving that man could live outside our atmosphere for prolonged periods. His patriotism, bravery and respectability go without saying... Cooper has recently made several public pronouncements concerning his strong belief in UFOs. While a guest on the Merv Griffin Show, Cooper shocked the viewing audiences by speaking for over five minutes on a topic that was only within the past few years often considered too bizarre for polite conversation. But there were some things that Cooper wouldn\'t even discuss on the air in front of the curious multitudes. Luckily Lee Spiegel is a personal friend of Gordon Cooper. They have conferred on several occasions, and while in the company of the man who is bound and determined to crack the \'Cosmic Watergate\' which he is convinced exists within the higher echelon of government, the former space traveler is more than happy to talk about his UFO experiences - and they are many. In the early 1950s, Cooper was assigned to a jet fighter group in Germany. While stationed there, he remembers very vividly the week an entire formation of circular objects passed over the Air Base on almost a daily routine. \'We never could get close enough to pin them down, but they were round in shape and very metallic looking,\' Cooper points out. UFOs were to continue to haunt him when the Air Force Colonel was transferred several years later to Edwards Air Force Base Flight Test Center in the California desert. What happened one afternoon while he was on duty at this military base is evidence enough that the government definitely does keep a lot of secrets when it comes to UFOs! The incident took place in the late 1950s, either 1957 or 1958 - as Cooper can best recall; and to this day, the photographic evidence of an actual UFO touching down upon the Earth is being kept under wraps. During this period, Cooper was a Project Manager at Edwards Air Force Base, just three or four years before entering America\'s space program. After lunch this particular day, Cooper had assigned a team of photographers to an area of the vast dry lake beds near Edwards. In a taped interview with UFOlogist Lee Spiegel, the former Astronaut disclosed that while the crew was out there, they spotted a strange-looking craft above the lake bed, and they began taking films of it. Cooper says the object was very definitely \'hovering above the ground. And then it slowly came down and sat on the lake bed for a few minutes.\' All during this time the motion picture cameras were filming away. \'There were varied estimates by the cameramen on what the actual size of the object was,\' Cooper confesses, \'but they all agreed that it was at least the size of a vehicle that would carry normal-sized people in it.\' Col. Cooper was not fortunate enough to be outside at the time of this incredible encounter, but he did see the films as soon as they were rushed through the development process. \'It was a typical circular-shaped UFO,\' he recollects. \'Not too many people saw it, because it took off at quite a sharp angle and just climbed straight on out of sight!\' Cooper admits he didn\'t take any kind of poll to determine who had seen the craft, \'because there were always strange things flying around in the air over Edwards.\' This is a statement Lee Spiegel was able to verify through his own research efforts, having obtained closely guarded tapes of conversations between military pilots circling the base and their commanding officers in the flight tower, tracking the presence of unknown objects. \'People just didn\'t ask a lot of questions about things they saw and couldn\'t understand,\' notes Cooper, who adds that it was a lot simpler to look the other way, shrug one\'s shoulders, and chalk up what had been seen to \'just another experimental aircraft that must have been developed at another area of the air base.\' But what about the photographic proof - the motion picture footage - that was taken? \'I think it was definitely a UFO,\' Cooper states, as he makes no bones about it. \'However, where it (the object) came from and who was in it is hard to determine, because it didn\'t stay around long enough to discuss the matter - there wasn\'t even time to send out a welcoming committee!\' After he reviewed the film at least a dozen times, the footage was quickly forwarded to Washington. Cooper no doubt expected to get a reply in a few weeks\' time as to what his men had seen and photographed, but there was no word, and the movie *vanished* - never to surface again.... On coast-to-coast television, Cooper recently made a blockbuster statement that had the telephone lines tied up the next day, as viewers telephoned the stations which carried the syndicated Merv Griffin Show, anxious to find out if their ears had been playing tricks on them the night before. Toward the end of the talk-show host\'s interview with the former Astronaut, Merv broke into a secretive tone of voice right on the air, and aimed a hundred-thousand-dollar question at his guest: \'There is a story going around, Gordon, that a spaceship did land in middle America and there were occupants, and members of our government were able to keep one of the occupants alive for a period of time. They\'ve seen the metal of the aircraft and they know what the people look like - is that a credible story?\' For all intents and purposes Cooper should have laughed for assuredly such a speculative story belongs in the category of science fiction or space fantasy. But Gordon Cooper kept a straight face when he replied: \'I think it\'s fairly credible. I would like to see the time when all qualified people could really work together to properly investigate these stories and either refute or prove them.\' The bombshell had been dropped. Cooper went on to say that from the various reports of UFO contacts and abductions he had been privy to, he was convinced that the occupants of this crashed UFO were \'probably not that different from what we are,\' - that they are almost totally humanoid (i.e., have two arms, two legs, a torso and readily identifiable facial features) in appearance. Taken aback by what Cooper had said over the national airwaves, Lee Spiegel telephoned Cooper\'s office the following morning and managed to get past his private secretary, though others in the media were getting the cold shoulder. \'Cooper admitted to me that he could have revealed more on the air, but he decided not to play his entire hand because he felt certain that some \'official eyebrows were going to get raised\'.\'' source: 'MJ-12 and the Riddle of Hangar 18' by Timothy Green Beckley; 1981; Inner Light Publications P.O.

', '1950, The Great Falls, Montana UFO Film A classic UFO film was taken on August 15, 1950, by Nicolas Mariana, general manager of the Great Falls 'Selectrics' baseball team. This film was listed as Top Secret and, although now declassified, is still considered an 'unknown.'Note that in government 'releases' (National Archives, etc.), the distant objects in the frames almost don\'t show up. However, even the TNT versions (as you will see later) show that the objects were clearly visible and oval-shaped, especially in the early footage. And the evidence strongly suggests that what Mariana has told us for a long time is true, much of the early footage was apparently removed by the Air Force. NICAP Synopsis: Nick Mariana, Great Falls, Montana, obtained 16 mm color movies of two UFOs which appear as bright circular points of light. Footage of UFOs at closer range, confirming visual observation of discs with rotating rims, was reported missing from film when returned by Air Force. Remaining footage was contained in United Artists documentary movie 'UFO' and compared to July 2, 1952, Trementon, Utah film showing similar images. Mr. Mariana used Daylight Kodachrome film in a Revere turret type camera and obtained 315 frames showing the UFOs. The film was examined by the Air Force and Navy, but no formal reports released. Report on Photogrammetric analysis by Dr. Robert M.L. Baker, Jr., Douglas Aircraft Corporation, on file at NICAP. Air Force explanation that UFOs were reflections off jet aircraft said to be 'quite strained,' and the analyst states no definite conclusion. However, UFOs could not be explained as any conventional objects.(Editor\'s Note: The video you see below is a comparison of what the general public had access to and what was kept under wraps for quite some time. Sometimes, only those who pay for first generation access get to see what was originally caught on video, as opposed to second and third generation 'copies.')', '1950-The Trent PhotographsA classic set of impressive UFO photos was taken by Mr. and Mrs. Trentin the early part of the evening, just before sunset, on May 11, 1950,near McMinnville, Oregon. According to the Trent\'s account the object,as it appeared over their farm was first seen by Ms. Trent while she wasfeeding the farm\'s rabbits. She then quickly called her husband who gotthe family\'s camera and Mr. Trent then took two shots from positions onlyjust a few feet apart. The pictures first appeared in a local newspaperand afterwards in Life magazine. Seventeen years later the photos weresubjected to a detailed analysis for the University of Colorado UFO Project.WilliamK. Hartmann, an astronomer from the University of Arizona, performed ameticulous photometric and photogrammetric investigation of the originalnegatives, and set up a scaling system to determine the approximate distanceof the UFO. Hartmann used objects in the near foreground, such as a house,tree, metal water tank, and telephone pole, whose images could be comparedwith that of the UFO. There were also hills, trees, and buildings in thefar distance whose contrast and details had been obscured by atmospherichaze.\xa0Hartmann used these known distances of various objects in the phototo calculate an approximate atmospheric attenuation factor. He then measuredthe relative brightnesses of various objects in the photos, and demonstratedthat their distances could generally be calculated with an accuracy ofabout +/- 30%. In the most extreme case, he would be in error by a factorof four. He then wrote:\xa0'It is concluded that by careful consideration of the parameters involvedin the case of recognizable objects in the photographs, distances can bemeasured within a factor-four error ... If such good measure could be madefor the UFO, we could distinguish between a distant extraordinary objectand a hypothetical small, close model.'\xa0Hartmann then noted that his photometric measurements indicated thatthe UFO was intrinsically brighter than the metallic tank and the whitepainted surface of the house, consistent with the Trent\'s description thatit was a shiny object. Further, the shadowed surface of the UFO was muchbrighter than the shadowed region of the water tank, which was best explainedby a distant object being\xa0 illuminated by scattered light from theenvironment.\xa0'it appears significant that the simplest most direct interpretationof the photographs confirms precisely what the witnesses said they saw'Hartmann further wrote that 'to the extent that the photometric analysisis reliable, (and the measurements appear to be consistent), the photographsindicate an object with a bright shiny surface at considerable distanceand on the order of tens of meters in diameter. While it would be exaggeratingto say that we have positively ruled out a fabrication, it appears significantthat the simplest most direct interpretation of the photographs confirmsprecisely what the witnesses said they saw.'\xa0In his conclusion, Hartmann reiterated this, stressing that all thefactors he had investigated, both photographic and testimonial, were consistentwith the claim that 'an extraordinary flying object, silvery, metallic,disc-shaped, tens of metres in diameter, and evidently artificial, flewwithin sight of [the two witnesses.'\xa0Controversy - The Skeptics\' Case\xa0Not satisfied with Hartmann\'s findings and totally devoid of any evidencethat the UFO was a hoax and hanging from the wires, UFO debunker RobertSheaffer argued qualitatively that the haze in the photos (the haze veiledthe UFO and led Hartmann to conclude the UFO was about 1.3 kilometres distant)could be due to a 'dirty' camera lens, and thus the object could stillbe close to the camera. He further argued that shadows on the garage werestrong evidence for a large time lag between the photos, and alleged thatthe shadow positions suggested the photos were taken at 7:30 in the morningrather than in the evening (the image on the left depicts the edge enhancementtechnique which, under typical conditions, can reveal the presence of awire less than a quarter of a millimetre thick at a distance of up to 3metres).\xa0Dr. Bruce Maccabee, an optical physicist, analyzed the original negativesand found no support for Sheaffer\'s time lag claim. He also repeated Hartmann\'scalculations in much greater detail, including corrections for lens greaseand obtained about the same results as Hartmann originally did. (One otherimportant aspect of Sheaffer\'s dirty lens hypothesis is that it fails toexplain why it didn\'t affect all objects in the photos, and not just theUFO. All the nearby objects in the photo were all sharp with high contrast,but the objects in the distance such as a barn, a house, trees, and hills(and the UFO), were of low contrast, exactly as would be expected fromabsorption and scattering of light.) Maccabee calculated the UFO to beover 1 kilometre away, and about 30 meters in diameter and 4 meters thick.\xa0Regarding the alleged reported time the photos were taken which, accordingto Sheaffer, would be inconsistent with the position of the shadows onthe photos, Maccabee discovered that the garage shadows could only havebeen caused by a diffuse light source, rebutting Sheaffer\'s argument. Maccabeesuggested that a bright cloud illuminated by the evening sun could possiblyhave caused them. Moreover, neither Sheaffer nor Klass has provided a plausiblecause as to why the Trents would have lied about this, especially sinceit is immaterial to analysis of the UFO\'s distance.\xa0Repeaters\xa0In his book 'UFOs Explained,' Klass argued that the Trents were 'repeaters,'citing a story published in the Portland Oregonian June 10 in which Mrs.trent is quoted as saying to reporter Lou Gillette that 'she had seen similarobjects on the coast three different times but no one would believe me.'Klass further quotes from a newspaper article written about 17 years later,in which she is quoted as saying 'We\'ve seen quite a few since then butwe didn\'t get any pictures, they disappeared too fast.'\xa0Klass indictment of 'repeater' is based solely on Mrs. Trent\'s claimsas reported in the paper. Assuming the account is accurate, an importantdetail however, is that Mr. Trent apparently did notagree with his wife.For reasons we can only guess, Klass did not include in his book Mr. Trent\'sresponse to the following question (story in the June 11, 1950 L.A. Examiner):\xa0'why [did you wait so long before telling anyone about [the photos.Trent admitted he was \'kinda scared of it.\' He said: \'You know, you hearso much about those things... I didn\'t believe all that talk about flyingsaucers before, but now have an idea the Army knows what they are.'\xa0This suggests that Mr. Trent had not seen any UFOs before and was skepticalabout flying saucers (hence his wife\'s claim that 'no one would believeme')... until he saw one himself. One get\'s into a logical muddle here.If, as Klass believes, there are no saucers and therefore the Trents couldn\'thave seen one, then Mrs. Trent must have been lying when she said she sawseveral previously. On the other hand, Mr. Trent was telling the truthabout his skepticism, although he could well have supported his wife\'sclaim by saying that he too had seen several even if he really didn\'t believethey existed. After all, if its a hoax, he could say anything to supportthe hoax story. One way to get out of this muddle is to assume that theyboth told the truth regarding previous sightings (Mrs. Trent had several,Mr. Trent had none and didn\'t believe in saucers). Of course, Mrs. Trentprevious sightings certainly could have been honest misidentifications...and if this were so then she wasn\'t really 'a repeater' unless you classifya person who repeatedly and honestly misidentifies objects as 'a repeater'[Maccabee op. cit., private communication.\xa0By Brian ZeilerAlso: www.nicap.org'

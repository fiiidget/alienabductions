1997,'The Phoenix Lights, 1997, ArizonaPhoenix Lights DepictionThe EvidenceUFO researchers and writers today are tantalized by the increasing reports of alien abduction, possible photographs of alien beings, physical trace cases, and implant removals.In a way we have become spoiled-expecting the sensational. This desire for ultimate proof has caused us to overlook the seemingly mundane, everyday reports of night lights, which were at one time sensational in their own right.With the ever growing technology of our era, pictures and video are often times called into question because of the ease of manipulation and creation afforded computer graphics experts. Called into question, that is, by those who are waiting in the wings to debunk any and all visible proof of UFOs as suspect of being hoaxed.This is especially true in cases with one or two photos taken by one witness. This has always been a pitfall to researchers who scratch and claw for authentication of a particular photograph or video. There are, however, those cases which have multiple photographs of the same object, taken by many witnesses.This type of case carries the heaviest weight for those who remain on neutral ground on the subject of UFOs. One of the best of these is the Phoenix, Arizona lights case of 1997. Supported by many photographs and videos, this fantastic event is still discussed and analyzed today.The Lights AppearEvidence points to March 13, 1997 as the onset of this extremely compelling account of various and sundry phenomenal lights which moved over the state of Arizona. These lights, though referred to as the 'Phoenix Lights,' were actually witnessed in at least five other cities.Phoenix has the distinction as the first Arizona city to report the unknown light sources, which were initially spotted over Superstition Mountains, east of the city, at about 7:30 PM. The first reports indicated an object of six points of light, immediately followed by a report of eight connected lights, with a separate ninth, which moved in unison with the eight.The formation was seen again over the Gila River just before 10:00 PM. In a matter of minutes, the enormous, lighted structure had made its way over the southern part of the city of Phoenix. At this time, literally thousands of people witnessed the object or objects. It was at this time, that the first photographs and videos were taken.The final sightings of the night were in Rainbow Valley. Witnesses there reported a very distinct 'V' formation. This sighting occurred at about 2:00 AM on March 14.The MothershipIt is important to note that there are various descriptions of the lights from the Nevada border throughout Arizona. Some witnesses described a very clear 'V' shape, while others said that the lights were circular or cresent-shaped. It is only common in night light cases for these differences to come to light. Many factors can attribute to these varying descriptions.One specific object can be seen from different angles, with the angle of the object only reflecting part of its light system, depending on atmospheric or weather conditions, or the very way a witness looks at the object can make this difference. It is very possible that two witnesses can see the same object at the same time, and give two completely different accounts.This fact has been proven in scientific studies of eye witnesses accounts in crime cases. Another possibility in the case in point is that there may have been several different objects of different shapes and sizes. In my own research into this case over the years, I have come to the personal conclusion that the main object over Arizona was of a circular shape, and this is corroborated by the various still and video film taken. There were other shapes observed, but it appears that the 'mother-ship' was circular.Eyewitness AccountsThough the huge lighted formation seemed to move in a tauntingly slow speed over Arizona, it was reported that strange lights had sped from the Henderson-Las Vegas, Nevada area toward Arizona, and seemed to slow down as it entered the Arizona area.Initial reports described anywhere from 5-7 points of light, and ultimately 8 with a trailing ninth. The enormous object was extremely low, and mountainous areas could be seen behind the craft in pictures, therefore giving photographic experts scale to approximate the elevation from the ground, and the distance from the camera.This would enable an estimate of the craft being a whopping one mile or more in length! The color of its lights were described as 'blue-white,' to 'yellow-white,' to 'amber.' Again, these differences of description do not necessitate there being more than one object. During the crafts fast moving period, it was estimated to be moving at Mach 2-3. As it slowed down as if posing to be filmed, the speed dropped to an estimated 10-15 MPH.At one point over Sky Harbor, it reportedly hovered for several minutes. The object was also reported to change shapes, speeds, and colors, as it made its way across the skies of Arizona. Phoenix1\t Phoenix6\t Phoenix2\t Phoenix5Various photographs of the Phoenix Lights(click on pic to view larger image)Between 9:00 and 9:30 PM on the 13th, one extraordinary description was made by a family in Mesa. They said that an enormous craft with a distinctive structure flew over their area. They described a triangle-shaped object with lights at the three corners, and another larger light in its center. Amazingly, they could clearly see panels on the craft which were in a grid pattern.There were also, about this same time, several reports of two round objects which seemed to detach from the larger 'V' shaped object, only to later rejoin the mother-ship. One witness described the 'V' shaped mother-ship dividing itself into two separate craft as it moved toward the city of Tucson.Another dramatic description of the mother-ship was made by a group of real estate agents who had subdivided property over the northern part of Phoenix. They would also get a close-up view of the gigantic disc.They estimated the craft to be a staggering two miles wide as it flew at a low altitude near Phoenix. They could see dozens of bright lights along the leading edges, and also a row of windows with 'silhouettes of people.'It also seems highly probably that for some reason, the giant craft turned off its lights, as observers could see only the windows with what appeared to be people shadowed in the glow of the inside. Another family got a brightly lit view of the unknown object, and described its color as 'flat blue-black, like the color of a shotgun barrel.'Among the most reliable witnesses of the craft\'s movements that first night were two airplane pilots, one retired from an airline, and another from Vietnam, who was also a U. S. Marshall. Though seeing the object at different times and places, both men described a craft of 'immense size,' measuring up to a mile long.The Marshall could also see the city lights of Phoenix reflecting from the bottom of the massive object, while it 'blocked out the stars.'One of the pilots also videotaped the UFO, but had the tape confiscated in a 'men in black' encounter. In a completely separate incident, a group of witnesses had reported a 'huge discoid' craft which was 'larger than Sun Devil Stadium at Arizona State University.'This object was hovering just above tree tops at the west end of Sky Harbor runway between 2:00 and 3:00 AM about two weeks prior to March 13.Military InvolvementIt was almost inevitable that the United States Air Force would become involved in an event of this magnitude, and the Phoenix lights mystery would be no exception. While driving down Interstate-I-17 from Camp Verde, a truck driver had been seeing two amber colored UFOs moving ahead of him southward for two whole hours.His destination was a materials plant near Luke Air Force Base. Upon arriving there, the two UFOs hovered nearby.While his truck was being loaded, the driver walked upon a pile of materials to get a better look at the two UFOs. He could make out two identical 'toy, top-like amber orbs' with a white glow to them. A band of red lights pulsated on the craft as it hovered near the Luke AFB runway.Suddenly, two F-16s 'blasted out of Luke with their afterburners on full.' Soon, a third plane followed, and all three made a direct run toward the hovering UFOs.As the first two jets were about to reach the UFOs, the unknown objects shot straight upward, and disappeared 'in an instant.' The two jets flew right through the exact spot the UFOs had previously occupied. A Luke ground crewman later confirmed to NUFORC that the driver\'s account was true.He also stated that upon returning to the base runway, one of the pilots had to be helped from his cockpit. He was visibly shaken from what had just happened.According to Peter Davenport of the NUFORC one of the more intriguing reports was submitted by a young man who claimed to be an Airman stationed at Luke Air Force Base, located to the west of Phoenix in Litchfield Park.He telephoned the National UFO Reporting Center at 3:20 a.m. on Friday, some eight hours after the sightings on the previous night, and reported that two USAF F-15c fighters had been “scrambled” from Luke AFB, and had intercepted one of the objects.Although the presence of F-15’s could never be confirmed, the airman provided detailed information which proved to be highly accurate, based on what investigators would reconstruct from witnesses over subsequent weeks and months.Two days after his first telephone call, the airman called to report that he had just been informed by his commander that he was being transferred to an assignment in Greenland. He has never been heard from again since that telephone call.The Flare TheoryThe Phoenix lights case is not without its controversy, much of which originated from the Air Force. In May of 1997, Luke AFB Public Affairs Office stated that Air Force personnel had investigated the so-called 'UFOs,' and had solved the case. They claimed that flares dropped from an A-10 'Warthog' had caused the numerous reports of night lights. This explanation is totally unfounded for several reasons.First of all, flares do not move in unison, fall toward the ground, and then fly back up into the air, and move across many miles without changing their relative positions. Secondly, many witnesses had made reports of the giant lights hours before the reported time of the launch of the flares.This would not be end of the Phoenix lights. Sightings over the Phoenix area have continued to this day, supported by eyewitness accounts, photographs and video.Article from The Arizona Republic.3-11-98Steve Wilson - Republic Columnist\'Phoenix Lights\' witnesses credible, hard to dismiss:When the 'Phoenix Lights' were reported last year, I yawned. I didn\'t see them, and breathless TV broadcasts were underwhelming. It seemed easy enough to dismiss the lights as flares or military aircraft. UFOs? You\'ve got to be kidding.Still, as the March 13 anniversary of the sightings approached, I was curious enough to seek out some witnesses. I suspected most would turn out to be UFO devotees. My skepticism was heightened by a New Times story last week that debunked the extraterrestrial theorizing and discredited a leading local theorist, Jim Dilettoso, as a 'quack scientist.'I found several people with credible credentials who witnessed the lights. At the least, their stories are interesting. Even if you regard their accounts dubiously, as I do, they raise legitimate questions.Enough questions, says Peter Davenport, director of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, that what happened that night 'may rank as the most dramatic UFO event in the past 50 years.'First, a little background. The lights were spotted between 7:30 and 10:30 in the evening over a 300-mile corridor from the Nevada line through Prescott Valley and Phoenix to the northern edge of Tucson. Some reports indicate that a single 'V' formation traveled across the state, while others suggest multiple UFO events. The lights were seen by hundreds of people.Here are four:Dr. Bradley Evans, 47, is a clinical psychiatrist from Tucson. He and his wife, Kris, were driving north on Interstate 10 to a swimming meet in Tempe. They watched the lights for 20 minutes or so move slowly south in a diamond formation and pass over them at an estimated 1,500 feet. Even then, with the car\'s moon roof open, they heard not a sound from the sky. He was 'awed' by the experience and has no idea what he saw. Kris said she couldn\'t explain it either and guesses it was 'something military.'Trig Johnston, 50, is a retired commercial airline pilot who lives in north Scottsdale. His 22-year-old son was looking for Comet Hale-Bopp that night when he noticed the lights and told his dad.'I looked up and remember saying out loud, 'I\'m going to chalk this up to an illusion.\' It was the size of 25 airliners, moving at about 100 knots at maybe 5,000 feet, and it didn\'t make a sound.I\'ve flown 747s across oceans and not seen anything like I saw that night,' Johnston said.'I don\'t expect anybody to take my word for it,' he added. 'This was something you had to see for yourself to believe.'Max Saracen, 34, is a real estate consultant who lives in north Phoenix. He and his wife, Shahla, were driving west on Deer Valley Road when they saw a huge triangular craft. They pulled off the road, got out and watched it pass overhead. 'It was very spooky -- this gigantic ship blocking out the stars and silently creeping across the sky. I don\'t know of any aircraft with silent engines.'Dr. X is a physician who lives near Squaw Peak in Phoenix and asked to remain anonymous for fear of ridicule.Her home has an elevated, panoramic view of the Valley, and she has some of the best known videotape and photographs of the lights. Though she had no prior interest in UFOs, the episode prompted her to begin her own investigation.'I think what happened is mind-boggling,' she said. 'I\'m trying to be as scientific as I can, and a number of things just don\'t compute.'I\'m not given to an otherworldly answer. But neither do I think these four people and so many others who saw the lights are all exaggerating or delusional.Of all the explanations, a U.S. military operation of some sort, maybe testing experimental aircraft, seems most likely. Mitch Stanley of Scottsdale said he could clearly see several planes when he pointed his telescope at the lights. But if it was a classified operation, why conduct it directly over the nation\'s sixth-biggest city?And if it wasn\'t, why hasn\'t the military simply acknowledged it?You don\'t have to be a ufologist to be puzzled about what lit the sky that night.Steve Wilson - Republic Columnist~end of article~', '1997 UFO Crash VideoFair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

Multiple sightings of UFOs on one night, preceded by several nights of unusual light beams reported over the Great Orme are related to us by well known investigator Margaret Fry. The events of November 10, 1997 center on one unfortunate family who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. For a brief period of time, they entered an unknown realm of other worldly beings.The family was driving along on the Bodfair / Landernog road when all of a sudden their car was engulfed by purple...a purple craft seemed to join itself to their automobile. The next clear memory any of the family had was that the craft was suddenly gone... like it just disappeared into thin air. The family was again driving down the road, resuming their journey except for the feeling of the loss of time.'But they could not account for considerable hours of time lost,' said Fry. 'The male was having trouble afterwards with a top molar tooth and he had to go to the dentist\'s... and a black unknown object fell out while he was at the dentist\'s - but he had no fillings,' she said.Shortly afterward, the male driver of the car reported the strange happenings to local authorities. Soon he was visited on two different occasions by Air Force personnel. They warned the man to never speak of the events of November 10, 1997 publicly. These visits are very similar to tales in America of the infamous 'men in black.' The strange purple craft and missing time experienced by the family was told only to a friend, who in turn related the event to investigator Fry. The names of the individuals involved remain anonymous. The case of the alleged abduction is extremely interesting in the light of the reports of the strange light beams and another eerie encounter of the same night.A local business man would corroborate the two other sightings with a bizarre report of his own. The man claimed to see a strange craft on the same road as the abducted family\'s encounter took place. He described the craft as enormous, and the shape of a 'child\'s spinning top.' He was able to draw a sketch of what he observed that night, while stopping to look at a UFO as big as a football field.The UFO, a classic saucer shaped object, was seen hovering over buildings in the village of Llandernog. He claimed that the large craft had a 'myriad of lit windows, 'and was large enough to be a mother ship capable of transporting hundreds of people. What was this enormous ship seen that night, except a visitor from another world? The case has never been explained by any earthly object or conventional means, and remains a mystery to this day.(B J Booth)<!--google_ad_client = 'pub-7518747415195612';/* 728x90, created 7/4/08 */google_ad_slot = '5690704701';google_ad_width = 728;google_ad_height = 90;//-->sources / references:BBC/North East Wales/Margaret Fry Return to :  Alien Abductions Index UFO Casebook Home', 'South Africa UFO Encounter, 1997This sighting took place in September 1997 while travelling home from windsurfing on an inland lake in South Africa. The journey took us past the CSIR (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) buildings on the periphery of the city of Pretoria which we passed on our left. It was dusk and we were travelling in a southerly direction home towards Johannesburg. My son (who is now a military instructor pilot and captain in the air force) and my wife were present while I was driving, with my son sitting on my left. My attention was drawn to what appeared a very tall tower of stacked disks ahead of us, slightly off to the right of the road, this tower conically tapered towards the bottom disk, i.e. the diameter of the top disk was largest and bottom smallest. The time taken from first sighting to passing the tower orthogonally to our right was approximately five minutes at a driving speed of some 120 km/h, resulting in a distance estimate of about 10 km.Each disk was dimly glowing with a reddish evenly distributed light and its equatorial circumference contained several bright orange light sources, about six or seven of these visible on each disk. We mentioned the phenomenon to each other and began to discuss possible explanations. In order to test that this was not due to some internally reflective optical effect (I was reasonably convinced that it could not be, anyway, but wanted to be as objectively scientific in the observation as possible) I opened the driver\'s window and looked at the 'tower' from outside - confirming that it was an external, 'real' phenomenon - this was further supported by seeing our progressive approach to it and its growing apparent dimensions in our perspective. We observed that 'disks' would periodically, at regular intervals, detach from the bottom of the tower and 'fly,' move off, in different directions - some would take approximately parallel courses, others would vary radically in their relative direction to previous disks. Although we followed the flight of these departing disks in some direct, and thereafter peripheral vision, our primary attention stayed with the 'tower'.We observed somewhere between ten to fifteen disks depart this way but did not feel motivated to make an accurate count - continually we had to balance our sense of 'reality' against what we were seeing and it was to say the least, an unsettling and surely disturbing phenomenon - it was not easily intellectually digestible. Although the 'tower' remained apparently stationary, the disks that flew off certainly appeared to be under intelligent, if not pre-programmed, stochastically robotic control.Knowing that four parallel fingers of one hand at arm\'s reach span about ten degrees I measured the apparent height of the tower shortly after sighting at about thirty-five degrees at the estimated ten kilometers - resulting in an estimated height of 7 km - this result did not surprise me due to the enormity of the 'tower' and the time taken to approach and pass it. The top disk easily spanned four parallel, vertically held fingers, which after some rough trig. works out to an estimated diameter of at least 1,7 km. The bottom disk of the 'tower' was some ten degrees above ground, which would put it at 1,8 km altitude - and a resulting 'total tower height of approximately 5,2 km. These are of course estimates but I would guarantee them as being within 20% of the true dimensions.No unusual sound was heard that would have apparently emitted from the 'tower' or individual disks during the entire event. No electronic / electromechanical or physiological disturbance was noted, beyond the induced emotional effects of the sighting.The orthogonal distance to our right as we passed the tower was difficult to judge due to the effect of it seeming to 'float' and the near-to-medium foreground under the apparent position of the 'tower' drifting in the opposite direction of our travel underneath it. There was no clear relating landmark or beacon that I could later use as distance reference.We mutually confirmed that we were seeing what we apparently were seeing - during this time the road was quite busy and we could tell from sideways glances, that the occupants of passing cars, and those we passed, were also all looking, and some pointing to the phenomenon - this, believe it or not, was an important objective confirmation to us.I reported this sighting the next day to personnel at the Johannesburg Planetarium (some of whom I knew personally, having done a course in Astronomy and also having bought a 4' Newtonian reflector telescope from them years earlier) There was little and if any, skeptical interest - further, I did not hear of any follow up, either privately or via the media. I am not interested in publicity at all - but think that responsible reporting and thorough follow-up investigation is vital in such cases. My personal opinion is that reporting subjects should be willing to voluntarily submit to polygraph testing with regard to the reported content of sightings - such not only to support the verity and facticity of their reports, but more importantly to support a body of reliable evidence. I would certainly be willing to submit to any verification supporting procedures.In conclusion it may appear strange that we did not drastically slow our speed or even stop - this was however a high-speed freeway and stopping is not allowed except in emergency; further we wanted to remain in the right-hand lane, incidentally the fastest, as the 'tower' was clearly going to pass on our right. The apparantly slow speed of our approach to the phenomenon was another reason motivating the maintenance of our road-speed.One emphatically expressed opinion that I will eternally remember being uttered as we passed the tower and we observed another disk departing was: 'My God, it\'s a mothership and those are \'daughter-disks\'...' Whether that sentiment was anywhere near an accurate assessment we may of course never know.I would be interested if any party who witnessed this specific event as well, or has seen a similar phenomenon, would supply their view and sighting report.Sincerely,Frank ValentynSubmitted to UFO Casebook<!--google_ad_client = 'pub-7518747415195612';/* 728x90, created 7/4/08 */google_ad_slot = '5690704701';google_ad_width = 728;google_ad_height = 90;//-->', '1997, Swissair Jet Has Near Miss With UFO  February 2000 - Strangely Shaped UFO Photographed   Stinson Lake, proximate to a U.S. army training area, may be an alien or government UFO base, or a focus of investigation or travel by aliens, one reason being possible mining as the area is rich in precious minerals. A mirror ship was photographed directing a beam of light at the hillside. Two questions that come to mind are: What was it? And why was it at an army operations area?   I was given a photograph last night of an object above the snow covered evergreens in the soupy late afternoon February sky of 2000 at Stinson Lake. It is not a painted object such as blue underneath and white on top, or black, or part metal and paint...   It is like a mirror reflecting the milky white sky above and the forest below color for color, tone for tone, hue for hue with intensity above surrounding fields at nearest equator and diminishing below surrounding fields (slightly faded at outer or left and right edges) undeniably displaying a round or roundish shape.   There are no wings and no engines noise according to the photographer. There is a shadow outlining its shape in a clearing below it and the same shadow is on the underside reflection. There's more.   After closely examining the object utilizing digital enhancement techniques, globes are seen underneath with hints of green and white lights, a possible dome on top which almost completely blends in with the sky and globular energy field where there are color shifts in the pixel spectrum where there are no added colors but a reorganization of existing colors suggesting a mirage effect also seen with the Mexico videos. The shifted field forms a perfect globe around the object exactly touching is outer edge no matter the attitude of the craft.   Sitting back a little from a 600% enlargement on the monitor screen, a field 'net' effect is obvious. The field appears webbed like a fish net formed into a globe and transparent white. Further, there is evidence of a beam of light pointing at a dark round spot also in a clearing on a nearby hill.   Above the object is a mushroom-shape distortion similar to the globular energy field but larger, which raises the question of the portal of origin or a second ship. It was so sudden, the photographer never had any indication of what was about to transpire as he shot landscape photographs in the otherwise peaceful environs around him.   The photographer happened to be at the site near where the U.S. Army has historically conducted paratrooper and other training. The Army's conventional presence may well have been replaced by something extremely advanced. But the sightings have not diminished in that remote and tranquil location unlikely to be stumbled upon by any tourist. '

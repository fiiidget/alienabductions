2003,'Alien Captured on Film in Alaska?Email sent to UFO Casebook on August 14, 2003Subj: Photograph taken by my grandfather Date: 8/14/2003 5:16:28 AM Central Standard Time  From: (name withheld by UFO Casebook) To: webmaster@ufocasebook.com File:  (293329 bytes) Dear Sir, The included picture was taken by my grandfather in the early 1930s. I scanned the image immediately after he gave it to me last week. I wish to remain anonymous since I don\'t want anything to do with any research or whatever on this. I know it looks like an alien or a Bigfoot and I know my grandfather was telling me the truth about him taking this picture. That\'s why I think it should be in the right hands. You are the only one I\'m sending this to, so please respect my privacy and don\'t contact me about this.Thanks in advance,Yours, (Name withheld)The only additional information is contained on the bottom of the full size image, which tells us the following:The picture was taken in the early 1930s by the sender\'s grandfather, who lived in Alaska. The entitiy was first seen when the grandfather was on his way to a lake. He chased the entity until he got close enough to take this one picture. It was some four months before the photograph was developed, being in in a remote, sparsely populated area. The sender received the picture from his grandfather only last week  His grandfather died the day after giving him the photo, and relating his story.To say the least, I was intrigued by this mysterious message. What could this image be? I downloaded it, and after looking at it a few moments, I knew it would be controversial to say the least. Little did I know that there would be more than one mystery to solve. As I began the task of selecting and cutting the area around the small creature, I thought to myself: 'Wouldn\'t it be something if this was the real thing, even though it may never be proven as such?' What if this gentleman\'s grandfather had really filmed a creature from another world, and I was looking at the proof. My excitement was only tempered by the thought of not being able to prove it one way or the other. I would soon be faced, however, with the second mystery.After doing a couple of trial runs, I was relatively pleased with the results, considering the fact that the scanned image was from a photograph approximately 70 years old. As I looked through several of the cutouts I had made, I thought maybe I saw something... something else. The entity\'s right lower arm/hand region seemed to be obscured; but by what? So I went back to the original scan, and starting working on that particular area. What I finally saw, or thought I saw was a second, even smaller entity. Is it possible that we had a female with her child? I had done what I could, and the results were inconclusive.I thought of the many other alleged photos of aliens, and how they were met with much skeptism. In other words, I have no definite answer as to what we are looking at here. It is one of three things:1) An outright hoax, (someone in a suit) and all their time and effort was wasted.2) A single unknown being, origin unknown, and we are without a way to go any further toward discovery.3)  Number 2, with two beings.All is not lost, and just like beauty being in the eye of the beholder, so is the result of what we have here.One final question remains; Which is more important anyway, the final solution of a mystery, or that mystery remaining alive and well?(B J Booth)', '2003, Ashland, Nebraska UFO Video An extremely compelling video of an unknown flying object was recently sent to me by my good friend and UFORA member Kim Shaffer, Director of MUFON, Tennessee. The video was taken in Ashland, Nebraska on November 30, 2003. The film shows a dark, oval object which makes some maneuvers that nothing I know of can make today. The report was first filed through the NUFORC, and MUFON made an investigation. Kim has been kind enough to send me the original NUFORC and MUFON reports. I have made a short clip for your viewing. (B J) The original NUFORC report goes as follows:'About 12:45 PM my husband yelled for me to come outside, what I saw was shocking and disturbing a very large, dark colored disk shaped object was hovering in the sky just south of my home. The object seemed to move in all directions (swoop from side to side and upside down) at times it looked as if it were floating then it would very quickly and smoothly fly further south and then come back. At one point the object seemed to be on its side with the top facing us while in that position a very bright white light came from the object. After a couple minutes the object slowly moved further up and further south, my husband ran in to get the camcorder and shot approx. 15-20 seconds of footage before the object was blocked by trees and longer in view. We have shown the footage to several people all were shocked and believe what they saw was a UFO.'source:Kim Shaffer MUFON TennesseeSee original NUFORC reportSee original MUFON report View video.', 'Coyne Helicopter / UFO IncidentOctober 18, 2003 MANSFIELD -- Thirty years ago tonight, strange things were happening in the skies over north central Ohio. A close encounter in Mansfield, that has since become known as 'The Coyne Incident,' is still raising eyebrows among believers and UFO investigators. That evening, in a soybean field on the west side of Galion, Rene Boucher and her brother Brad encountered a bright light in the sky that has lured her from Florida for another sojourn into that field. It was about 11 p.m. on Oct. 18, 1973, when an Army Reserve helicopter came perilously close to colliding with an unidentified flying object. Arrigo 'Rick' Jezzi, 56, who now lives in Cincinnati, was flying the Huey helicopter that night. Three decades later, he is still not sure what happened. Jezzi was one of four members of an Army Reserve unit based at Hopkins Airport in Cleveland on board. The crew was en route to Cleveland from Columbus. 'Capt. Larry Coyne was the pilot,' Jezzi said. 'I was in the left seat, actually flying the Huey at the time. We were near Mansfield flying at 2,500 to 3,000 feet.' John Healey and Robert Yanacsek were in the back of the Huey, near a cargo door with a Plexiglas window. 'One of the guys in the back reported a red light. He said it looked like an aircraft light on the right horizon,' Jezzi said. 'I couldn\'t see it.' Jezzi was flying from the left seat. On the other side of the Huey there was a 12-foot section of fuselage between the side window and the cargo doors. He figures the red light was in his blind spot.'Then I heard \'I think its coming toward us\',' Jezzi said. 'The next thing I knew Larry took control of the throttle. We went into a maneuver, a controlled free fall. We dropped about 2,000 feet.' Jezzi said if Coyne had not made the drastic maneuver there would have been a collision. 'It took just a couple of seconds,' Jezzi said. 'I remember looking up through the ceiling and I saw a white light moving over top of us. I followed it to the left horizon where it disappeared.' Jezzi isn\'t sure what he saw. It was like no aircraft he\'d ever seen. He guessed it was traveling at least 500 knots, twice the speed of his Huey. 'Red navigational lights aren\'t located in the front of an aircraft,' he said. 'That\'s what was moving toward us. I don\'t know what it was.' The incident was documented by witnesses on the ground. In UFO lore the 'Coyne Incident' is regarded as one of the most reliable UFO sightings of all time. 'It caused a lot of hullabaloo,' Jezzi said. 'The first thing I thought was those Commie bastards. What are they up to.' The next morning two of the other crew members, while being questioned about the incident, sketched drawings of the cigar-shaped craft they observed. 'They both came up with similar drawings,' Jezzi said. The magnetic compass in the Huey never worked right after the incident and had to be replaced. Rene Bouchard doesn\'t know what she saw in Galion about 60 minutes earlier that same evening. 'I was in high school. My brother was in junior high,' she said. 'There had been a lot of sightings in the days and weeks before that. Even the governor reported seeing something. We thought we\'d give it a try.' She and her brother walked out in the field behind their home and started watching the sky. 'We saw a bunch of stuff that looked like it was maybe 30,000 feet in the air,' she said. 'But it wasn\'t anything spectacular. Then I think we both put our heads down for some reason. That\'s when we saw this brilliant white light. It was as bright as the sun. I don\'t know what it was but it scared us. We ran for two blocks until we got home.' Rene has since moved to Florida. Her brother is in California. She\'s back in Galion today and plans to go out in that same bean field to spend part of her evening. 'We really saw something that night,' she said. 'I don\'t know what it was. But I\'ll be back there (tonight). I called my brother and asked him to fly here so he could go with me. He said no. I\'m not expecting to see anything. But I\'m going to be there.' rkent@nncogannett.com ', 'Extraordinary UFO Film Taken In UNITED KINGDOM 2003The following sighting report with video was sent exclusively to the UFO Casebook, USA. The information was shared with UFO Casebook Field Investigator Michael, who resides in the United Kingdom.The video files that are shown here were taken in Leyland, Lancashire, U. K. The film was made between 16:15 and 17:05 hours on 16 Nov 2003. The videographer Martin H. has sent very impressive film before to the UFO Casebook. Our field investigator has found him to be an honest and sincere man who is not in any way or form attemptimg to perpetuate a hoax or initiate a joke.He has never asked for any monies for his film, but has sent digital video files through the internet, and also hand given physical video tape for free use for study. The video film in its entirety is 8:13 long; is in the Windows Media format (.wmv) and is 25.15 megabytes. A sample clip of film is enclosed for your study. Below is Martin\'s description of how the taking of the video film in question transpired.I decided to have a look at the early evening sky, camcorder at ready just in case. At about 16:15, I first spotted the unknown object quite a way off in the distance (through binoculars and spotting scope). It took me around 20 minutes before I could zoom in with the camcorder to start filming.The sky was quite clear with just a few wispy clouds here and there. The distance is quite difficult to judge but I would say that the object is possibly around 10 to 15 miles away. I was on my own this time with no other witnesses and with the distance involved, I couldn\'t hear any sound emanating from the object.All in all, I managed to film around 20 or so minutes before the object disappeared behind a cloud in the distance. The object went behind the cloud at around 17:05.Martin H.UFO CasebookDownload Windows File, 590 KB(left click to play, right click and select 'save target as' to download.)Leyland, Lancashire, U.K. Sightings, August 2002Note: The account of these sightings, the images, and video files are the property of the owner, Martin H., who resides in Leyland, Lancashire, U.K. The UFO Casebook is producing this web page with the permission of copyright holder. The files on this page cannot be reproduced in any way without the expressed written consent of the copyright holder.Leyland, Lancashire, United Kingdom.Tuesday 20th August 2002The UFO Casebook has received a compelling account of several sightings of an anomalous object which was videotaped in Leyland, Lancashire, United Kingdom.The witness has given a detailed account of these sightings, and sent along several extraordinary video clips of two unique unknown flying objects, which appear to interact with one another.There were also two corroborating witnesses to the sightings. At least for the time being, the main witness will go by the name of Martin H.My girlfriend and I were doing the evening dishes in the kitchen when she spotted what looked like a bright star in the early evening sky. She pointed this out to me and it being early evening about 20:20 hours, there were no other stars visible.I ran upstairs and grabbed my camcorder (Sony with 80X digital zoom) After several attempts I finally managed to zoom in on the object. When I looked at it, I couldn\'t believe my eyes.I zoomed in for a 4th time but this time with the camera recording and just after I had zoomed in, a black/grey saucer shaped craft moved from left to right behind the UFO which I had originally followed. This was only for a few seconds.I then returned my focus to the main object. It was an oval shape with a green metallic top and red bottom and the middle of the object seemed like an extremely bright plasma light which pulsated every now and then.The object was moving quite slowly and deliberately. I carried on filming until the object finally disappeared behind the roofline of a row of houses at the back. I would say that the object was approximately 20 miles away heading over towards the Irish sea somewhere between Blackpool and Southport. I checked the local media out for the following few days but couldn\'t find any reference to any other reports that week.There were no other aircraft (Military or otherwise) in the area and because of the distance involved I couldn\'t hear any sound emanating from the object. Leyland, Lancashire StillsI filmed the whole sequence from an upstairs bedroom window, my girlfriend could only see what appeared to be a very bright slowly moving star, as she was looking at it with the naked eye. A rough estimate regarding the height; I think it started out at approx. 3 to 4 thousand feet and looked like it descended to approx. 2 to 2 and a half thousand feet.Sunday 26th August 2002I had telephoned my brother (along with a whole host of friends) to tell them about the UFOs I had filmed, and my brother came around on the Sunday to view the video.After watching the video we went out into the back garden for some fresh air and I pointed out the area where I had filmed the objects adding that the evening sky looked exactly the same as it did then. I joked with my brother saying that I had a feeling that the object would come back again.Leyland, Blackpool, Southport MapI was just about to go back inside when I spotted it again, I couldn\'t believe my luck and I don\'t think my brother could quite believe it either. I rushed inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars for my brother so he could continue to view it from the back garden, I had the camcorder set up in no time at all and managed to film 25 minutes.Approximately 14 minutes into the filming my brother shouted up asking if I had the object in view.'Why? I asked.''Because there is something approaching the object,' he exclaimed excitedly.From left to right a cigar shaped craft slowly passed behind the object, which I followed until it began to fade. Then I went back to the main object. After it had disappeared behind the roofline, we immediately set up and watched the film all the way through and couldn\'t believe it when the cigar shaped object appeared.Testimony of brother, Andrew H.I went to Martin\'s house with the sole purpose of viewing the video tape of the first sighting that he had.When we had finished, we went outside as it was a warm evening. Suddenly, the object appeared again. I didn\'t want to take my eyes off it, so my brother went inside for some binoculars for me so that I could have a closer look.What I saw amazed me. It was a very bright and slow moving object which pulsed at regular intervals. We observed it for quite a while, during which time it was approached by a smaller grey object which seemed to fly past it at great speed before disappearing totally from sight.I was a little sceptical before that day, but I now know there is another world out there.Kind regards, Andy H.During the following few weeks I managed to film the object two more times and have approximately 1 to 2 hours of video.I have seen UFOs before in Holland (Where I used to live) and in Croatia (On holiday) but didn\'t have a camcorder until quite recently.Lancashire has quite a rich history regarding UFOs and just recently I have on 3 separate occasions spotted a different sort of UFO which only seems to appear for a few seconds before vanishing completely... I am going to set up my camcorder to film the area of sky involved and see what develops.(Martin H.)', ' The Manhattan Abduction (Linda Cortile Napolitano) The Linda Napolitano affair is without question one of the best documented alien abduction cases in UFO history. Most of these cases are related to authorities and investigators by a single person. It is extremely unusual to have multiple witnesses, especially those totally unknown to the experiencer,  to validate the facts of an alien abduction. Hopkins did an exceptional job of holding together the case, despite some unusual twists and turns.  Skeptics, as you would expect, dismiss the case without offering any evidence to support their theories, except the commonly used statement, 'it can\'t happen, so therefore it didn\'t.'  In a recent French magazine, La Gazette Forteenne, Issue # 2, 2003, Linda gives an interview that does add some new facts about her case. She mentions a new witness, a New York Post truck driver, who saw the abduction from the Brooklyn Bridge. No name is givenThere had also been rumors of the abduction causing a small traffic jam on the intersection between South Street and Catherine Slip. Now, there is a witness who saw the stopped traffic at approximately the same time as the abduction. Linda says:'At the New York Post complex, a well-known journalist leaves a nearby bar. Too drunk to drive, he asks one of the drivers if he can drop him home. The driver answers that the lorries cannot move because there are several limos blocking the street. He even suspected that the big boss could be paying a visit to the newspaper.' Supposedly, the lead limo was the one carrying Dan, Richard, and Cuellar. Hopefully, more information will be forthcoming in the near future.

I am reluctant to reveal the exact location out of concern for my friend's privacy as well as my own. However the general location is just North of Main street on the East side of 110 and South of the train tracks. My boy was sledding in the snow and I was taking pictures.       It was in the evening and was starting to get dark pretty quickly. My son pointed up to the sky and we noticed some lights coming in from what I believe is the south west. At that point I just pointed the camera up and took the shots. The object really gave me the impression of a balloon - except for the lights. They seemed to cycle all different patterns. The object passed almost directly overhead (picture 1) and then headed south towards the train tracks (picture 2). As the object passed I could make out more of a disk shape than a balloon shape. I just remember my son asking me over and over what it was and I didn't have a clue.

2005,'CHILE: UFO Landing Video under AnalysisINEXPLICATA-The Journal of Hispanic -July 1, 2005 Incredible images depict the landing of an unidentified flying object in southern Chile. A research organization is conducting detailed analysis.  (TERRA.cl)  CHILE, June 25, 2005-- Incredible images of an alleged UFO landing in the vicinity of Ultima Esperanza in Chile\'s 12th region were made known only a few days ago by the  Agrupación de Investigaciones Ovniológicas de Chile (AION). This sequence of clips form part of an exclusive video taken in one of the world\'s southernmost locations and which show the vast amount of UFO manifestations in that territory, which is considered a UFO \'hotspot' by domestic ufologists.   This video was taken on March 17, 2004 and has been in safekeeping to date by virtue of being considered one of the most interesting items of evidence in recent years in Chile. . AION\'s director, Rodrigo Fuenzalida, will present a series of new documents on UFOs in Chile and the world on July 2, at 1700 hours at the Alameda Art Thater. The most significant events have been recorded in Brazil, Chile and the United States. Evidence collected in Chile has also had considerable impact, ranging from the UFO photographed over Termas del Flaco to videos collected in the country\'s 12th region which are being subjected to analysis. 'We are analyzing some interesting UFO video material taken in area which, to our understanding, has the greatest concentration of UFO incidents,' notes Fuenzalida. The event will take place on Saturday, July 2 at Cine Arte Alameda beginning at 1700 hours. Produced by AION CHILE and  Chilecasting, coproduced by Cine Arte Alameda.

Carlos Cauich Carrillo shot a video of an unknown object that appeared to accompany the airliner in which he was a passenger for several minutes. The flight was covering the Tapachula-Mexico route on September 21, 2005.  When interviewed, the witness states that he felt very nervous and that he felt as though 'something or someone' had placed him there at the exact moment the sighting was to occur, since he was initially only filming images of the landscape as seen from the air. The video was made with a Cyber Shot DSC-P32, 3.2 megapixels, and has an approximate duration of 10 seconds. Upon reviewing the material, I noticed that this unidentified flying object was performing irregular movements at high speed, vanishing completely out of frame at certain moments. This confirms Ing. Cauich\'s notion that the alleged UFO was speeding away from the airliner and then returning. This event took place at 14:15 hours as the Mexicana de Aviacion airliner flew over the state of Oaxaca\'s Salina Cruz region. Ing. Cauich has has sightings prior to this date. His steadfastness in watching the skies and his ability to obtain UFO evidence is noteworthy. As an additional piece of information, I interviewed aviation technician Alfonso Salazar Mendoza, a UFO researcher and writer, who kindly informed me that commercial airliners flying at cruising altitude achieve speeds of 800 km per hour and an altitude of 12,000 meters. This information provides an approximate estimate. Sincerely,Profra.

I havenever reported anything like this before. At 23:30 on 5/27/05 while taking my nightly walk, I obsereved a triangluarcraft (craft) traversing the sky from north to south at about 20K feet. Thesky is very clear this night with several miles of clear visibility. The craft\'s speed was about 500 knots. The craft was perfectly silent andmoving rapidly. Several miles behind the craft was what appeared to be afighter jet moving very rapidly, 600 to 700 knots. As the jet was chasingthe craft they both where flying toward my position. I could begin to hearthe engines of the jet at that time. It appeared as thought the triangular craft was toying with the jet in thatas the jet got closer to the craft, the craft would speed up somewhat andleave the jet behind. As the craft and jet got nearly directly over mylocation, the triangular craft made a sharp right hand turn the the west.The jet was unable to make the turn at the same angle as the craft. Thejet\'s turn was much more pronounced and made a much wider loop. Due to that, the jet lost quite a bit of ground on the craft during theturn, yet again as both craft began traverseing in a straight line towardthe west-nortwest the craft again appeared to toy with the pursuing jet inthe same manner aforementioned. After a few seconds it appeared that the craft accelerated dramaticaly andleft the jet behind. I observed the jet make one tight loop several milesfrom my position and then turn off to the north-northeast and flew out of myline of sight. One thing that was odd about the triangular craft was the three lightsmaking up the trianglar pattern were not equal in distance. Referencing thewingspan of the jet, two of the lights on the craft were about 50 to 75 feetapart and the third light was approximately 100 to 150 feet from the othertwo lights. Additionally, the two lights closer together were at the front and the otherfurther away light was at the rear facing the pursuing jet. This made thecraft to appear to be moving in reverse. It should be noted, that the color of the triangular craft lights were anunusual milky white color, nothing like that of the very bright red, greenand white lights observed on the jet. Tinker Air Force Base, which does have fighters, is located about 25 mileseast of my house. I assure you that this is a true account of what I observed on the stateddate and time.NUFORC Note: We spoke with this witness via telephone on two occasions,and we found him to be quite objective in his description of the allegedsighting, and very well organized in his description of what it was heapparently witnessed. We have invited him to contact media and law enforcement offices, to inquirewhether anyone else might have been witness to the event. Also, he willcontact the FAA ARTCC in Oklahoma City, to inquire whether the controllerson duty Friday night, May 27, might know what the cause of the incident was.We have to allow for the possibility that the object apparently beingpursued by what may have been a military fighter jet may have been an F-22'Raptor' fighter on a test flight, but even that aircraft would have to havedisplayed conventional red and green marker lights on its wing tips. The witness will submit an illustration of what the lights on the objectlooked like to him, as he viewed it from the ground. If any visitors to the NUFORC site were witness to this event over Oklahoma,we would request that they submit a short report of what they saw, using theOnline Report Form on our website. We invite visitors to our site to compare this report with the reportsubmitted from Kirkland, Washington, (located just east of Seattle)regarding an alleged sighting of a bizarre-looking, triangular craft at00:18 hrs.

1996,'1996-Alleged UFO Crash in Boyle Co., IrelandAccording to the Mirror, 'UFO expert' and 'clairvoyant' Rory Thornton, who runs a 'clinic' in Newcastle Co. Galway, maintains that the Irish Government have been covering up the crash of an extra-terrestrial craft near Boyle, Co. Roscommon, in May 1996. Mr. Thornton has gone to such lengths as even comparing the crash to the alleged cover up of the controversial 'Roswell Incident' of 50 years ago, and he seems to be of the opinion that the 'Roswell Coverup' is established fact, rather than a swamp of glutinous information. Apparently, this spacecraft 'got into trouble' before hitting some trees and 'bouncing into a lake'. Without a smidgen of an explanation as to how these spacemen, or, as he calls them, the 'Sunasians' got their machine working again, Mr. Thornton says he's in regular contact with them using telepathy. The article veers off into an off-the-rack 'The aliens are worried that we're running our planet into the ground' scenario, which is reminiscent of the 'Create Your Own Conspiracy Theory' website. The icing on the fruitcake comes in the form of this wonderful quote: 'They are are like humans. In fact we are the aliens to them'. Mr. Thornton's allegations concerning Irish Governmental conspiracies are rather interesting, especially when one considers the spate of dirty laundry which has recently been aired in Dáil Eireann and Dublin Castle. According to Mr. Thornton, an anonymous Boyle Garda (Irish policeman) maintains that the local Gardai were told to 'keep their noses out of it' by Government officials who were on the scene of the supposed crash. Over coffee and whiskey last night, author and lighthouse visitor Peter Costello wryly pointed out to me that it may have been Mr. Ray Burke trying to sell passports to the 'aliens'. For those of you who are unaware, Mr. Burke was Irish Minister for Foreign affairs until Tuesday 7th October, when he resigned amid allegations of his having sold passports to wealthy Saudi Arabian bankers in return for $20 million pounds of industrial investment. Incidentally, Mr. Burke was not in government when the Boyle incident took place. People in Boyle seem to be adamant, if one can believe the Sunday Mirror, 'that something big happened there that night'. Several US military Jeeps were also allegedly seen in the area, but as some of you may remember, this isn't the first time that Blather has discussed the diplomatic intricacies of letting foreign military personnel wander about Ireland, officially or otherwise. In fact, this isn't the first time I'd heard about the 'Boyle Incident' either, the tale came to my notice via the grapevine almost a year ago, and supposedly propagated by an anonymous Boyle Garda (presumably the one mentioned above). It told of 'something crashing', pieces of debris everywhere, the general area being overrun by the security forces and the arrival of a few large cars, supposedly containing unnamed politicians and US embassy representatives. I heard no more about it, but the story did get round, and with surprisingly minimal embellishment, until three weeks ago, when the Mirror got hold of it. So, if anything happened, what could have happened? Let us, for a start, discount the extra-terrestrial hypothesis, and consider the implications of something even as trivial as a drop tank from a US military aircraft falling on Irish soil. This might drag Ireland's so-called neutrality into question, hence the presence of politicians, US embassy officials etc. at the 'crash scene'. It wouldn't be the first time that something of this nature has taken place, even without the inclusion of any cross-border trespasses in the cauldron of conspiracy. Many years ago, a large object buried itself in the side of one the Wicklow mountains, in eastern Ireland. It was mentioned on early morning radio, and it was hypothesised that some sort of of unmanned drone had wandered out of a British military testing area in the Irish Sea. Some 'British officials' allegedly appeared and took it away with them, and not another word was heard. Or so the story goes.

Philip Mantle is the former Director of Investigations for the British UFO Research Association. ', 'The Yukon Territory Encounters, 1996 (Klondike Highway)\\22+ Witnesses Observe a UFO Larger than a Football StadiumYukon Territory, CanadaInvestigated by Martin Jasek, M.Sc., P. Eng.The following is as brief a summary that could be made from a complex 22-witness event and still retain a good portion of the impact and scope of what had occurred. More detailed descriptions and vivid quotes from the witnesses can be found in the individual witness testimonies.Event SummaryWitnesses FOX2 and FOX3 were driving together from Whitehorse to Carmacks in two separate vehicles. As they were travelling northbound on the Klondike Highway adjacent to Fox Lake, they spotted a huge UFO out over the frozen lake.Fox Lake is on the west side of the highway. Both of them slammed on the brakes stopping about 570 metres (1870 ft) apart from each other. FOX2 got out of his vehicle for a better observation.The UFO proceeded to slowly drift towards FOX2 and after a few minutes he found himself almost directly underneath the object! FOX3 continued to observe his cousin FOX2; both men were in complete awe!. The UFO continued to move slowly across the highway and out over the hill to the east and eventually disappeared behind it. Immediately after the sigthing, FOX3 noted that the time was 8:30 pm. Both FOX2 and FOX3 could discern that the lights were attached to a smooth and solid object.At the very same time that FOX2 and FOX3 were observing the UFO move across the lake, FOX4 and FOX5 were approaching the southern tip of Fox Lake also heading northbound.What they observed was a huge row, or rows, of lights slowly moving across the lake. There were other lights on and around the UFO as well. Their first thought was that it was a large truck in the distance, but it couldn’t be, it was out over the lake. Their next thought was that a Boeing 747 was crash landing. But that couldn’t be either, it was moving much too slowly to be an aircraft.It took them about 2 seconds to process these thoughts when they realized that it must be a UFO! They got very concerned. They had a two-year-old son in the back seat and they were travelling towards this thing! After some debate they decided to continue their journey.After all, they could no longer see the UFO as they approached a hill that obscured their view plus there was some traffic ahead of them. FOX5 looked at the car clock, it was 8:23 pm. None of the witnesses heard any sound coming from the object.A few minutes later, when FOX4 and FOX5 were passing the Fox Lake campground, they passed by two vehicles that were pulled over with two men outside looking up at the sky. They turned around and pulled over to talk to them.It was FOX2 and FOX3 carrying on a lively discussion, 'What the ‘heck’ was that?' After a few minutes FOX4 and FOX5 left and eventually stopped at Braeburn Lodge about 34 km (21 miles) further up the highway. FOX4 walked into the lodge and said to Steve Watson, the lodge owner 'Steve, I really need a coffee!' Steve replied 'Oh, you must have seen what FOX1 saw?' In fact FOX4 recalled seeing FOX1 leaving Braeburn Lodge just as they got there.About half an hour before the sighting described above (about 8:00 pm) FOX1 was driving along Fox Lake and had noticed a light in the distance which should not have been there. He did not think too much of it but as he got closer to the light, he could tell that it was illuminating a long smooth curved surface.He then passed some traffic and after his eyes readjusted to the darkness, the curved surface and the light were gone. However, his eye caught a group of rectangular lights moving over and behind a hill to the east.At this point he got an 'exhilarating feeling' and sped up in order to reach a less obscured location in the valley so that he would have a chance to see the UFO again. He pulled over and got out of his vehicle but didn’t see anything more unusual. He continued his journey and pulled into Braeburn Lodge where he gave Steve a description of what he saw and also made drawings for him. FOX2 and FOX3 eventually pulled into Braeburn Lodge and gave their description to Steve as well.There was also a 6th witness to the Fox Lake sighting but it is unclear what time she had driven through the area. FOX6 was driving in the vicinity of Fox Lake when she noticed a glow on her dashboard that could not be accounted for by the interior illumination of her vehicle.She leaned forward to look up through her windshield and observed a large arrangement of multi colored lights. The interior lights in her car started to go dim and the music from her tape deck slowed down.At around the same time, between 8:30 and 9:00 pm, the Village of Pelly Crossing (about a 2 hours drive to the north of Fox Lake) was experiencing its own truly incredible UFO sighting. PEL1 was tending his trapline northeast of Pelly when he observed in the distance to the southwest a long row of lights slowly moving over the hills. At first he thought it was a large aircraft coming down. But it was moving much too slowly.'It’s a UFO!'As he was walking his flashlight happened to point in the direction of the UFO. As if reacting to his flashlight, the UFO started speeding rapidly toward him.He instinctively cupped the end of his flashlight. As soon as he completed this gesture, the UFO stopped in its track. In a matter of less than a second, it was hovering an estimated 300 yards (275 metres) in front of him! PEL1 had to turn his head from one side to the other to take it all in.Again there was no sound at all coming from the object. A beam of light emanating from the bottom of the UFO swooped the ground once directly underneath the object. Was it a search beam? Looking for him? The UFO then drifted slowly to the right. There were other beams emanating from the craft as well; a greenish phosphorescent color beam shone horizontally out the front (right); two beams at the back (left) rotated slowly to a horizontal position.All the beams could be seen clearly as there were ice crystals in the air. PEL1 turned away from the UFO momentarily and ran across a small clearing. When he turned back to look at it, it was gone.At about the same time, PEL2 and PEL3 were travelling northbound just south of Pelly Crossing. To the north they spotted a huge row of lights slowly moving from left to right. They pulled over at a gravel pit just south of the Village to get a better look and got out of their vehicle. PEL2 noticed that the Big Dipper was just above the row of lights and compared the length of the lights to the width of the Big Dipper.They were about the same length! This observation was very important since it established a well-referenced angular size of the UFO from PEL2 and PEL3’s perspective, important for a more accurate triangulation and calculation of UFO size.The accounts of witnesses PEL1 through 3 were enough to complete a calculation of UFO size. The observations of witnesses PEL4, 5, 6 and 7 about the same time provided a second triangulation. The four women were taking an evening course at a small community college in Pelly Crossing (a satellite school of Yukon College).They were out on a break on the front deck of the one story building looking towards the west when they too observed the row of lights. The row of lights was travelling slowly almost towards them and slightly towards the north. They recall the object being huge as well; there was no sound at all. It moved slowly over the hill to the north and disappeared behind it.Then there was the UFO sighting near the Village of Carmacks seen by 9 witnesses. The UFO was observed by two groups of people. CRM1, 2, 3 and 4 were on the highway northbound in a pick-up truck just south of Carmacks; CRM5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 consisted of a husband, wife and their 3 children.They were watching television when they spotted the row of lights out of their window.The four men traveling together pulled over near the landfill at the southern edge of the Village to get a better look at the UFO. They watched the noiseless object move slowly to the northeast, curve around them to the south and head up a valley adjacent to the microwave tower south of the village where it just vanished.At one point the UFO was partially obscured behind a nearby hill and one witness recalls the UFO slowly reappearing on the other side of it. He remembers waiting a long time for the last light to reappear from behind the hill; that’s how slow and large the object was!The object took up about a 60 to 90 degree horizontal chunk of the sky. CRM1 recalls hearing about the Fox Lake UFO sighting on the radio the next day and surmised that they saw the UFO about an hour and a half earlier, about 7:00 pm.The family is not exactly sure what time it was when they saw the UFO, just that it was in the evening. They observed the row of lights just to the northwest of them moving slowly to the northeast. The lights were just over the treeline and there was no noise at all.The lights continued to move until they disappeared one by one behind what appeared to be an invisible wall. There was no mountain in that direction that could account for this. With the UFO sighting occurring just two weeks prior to Christmas, the three children thought that it was Santa Claus and his reindeer in the sky.An estimate of the UFO size by triangulation was not possible for the Carmacks UFO sighting, as the geometry of the witness locations in relation to the UFO was less than ideal. Furthermore, it was unclear whether both the family and the group of four men in the truck observed the UFO at the same time. Perhaps the UFO made more than one pass by the Village that night.There is also some evidence to suggest that this 'sighting event' encompassed an even larger area as UFO reports were heard on CBC North radio the very next day mentioning sightings in the communities of Dawson, Mayo and Watson Lake.No witnesses from these additional communities have thus far come forward or been identified.', '1996 - Pilot Encounters Giant Pyramid-shaped UFO in BrazilFair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

Suzy bolted ahead of Reed who soon heard her barking. In a moment or two, the barking turned even more ominous sounding.Reed was sure that Suzy was in a fight with a wild animal, maybe a bear. They had spotted one earlier in the day.Grabbing a large tree branch to ward off some fierce competitor, he finally came close enough to see the cause of the struggle. To his utter shock, he was staring at a being beyond his wildest imagination.The beast was moving at lighting speed, and vibrating simultaneously. The beast grabbed Suzy and began to tear her to shreds.Reed yelled, and caught the attention of the beast, who stared at him in a fierce, menacing fashion.Somehow, Reed managed to crack the beast on the head, supposedly killing it. The creature was about 4-5 feet tall, but had more mature features than its childlike size would indicate.The creature was wearing a one piece, seamless, black garment, which rejuvenated itself when cut or torn.Reed, exhausted from the emotional, adrenaline flowing ordeal, rested for a time, contemplating what to do.After a period of two hours, Reed heard a humming sound in the forest, and followed it until he saw a black obelisk hovering above the ground.Fighting off heavy, electrostatic laden air, Reed managed to touch the obelisk. Eventually, the humming stopped. He neither saw nor heard anyone... or anything else in the vicinity of the black obelisk.The doctor was sick, and totally exhausted, but tried to regain his strength. Darkness was drawing near, so Reed wrapped up the alien in a thermo blanket for the long one and a half hour journey back to transportation.All the while, a thousand thoughts went through his head. Was what he had the discovery of the century? If so, how could he preserve and protect it? Arriving home, he placed the alien in a freezer in his garage. Soon he fell into a deep sleep.The next day, he went back to the freezer, took out the alien, and all the while manipulating the alien body parts, video taped the creature.He tried to find some friends to share the experience, but managed only one. He tried to hide his photos and videos with another friend, but the bulk of the evidence was ultimately lost, except for some that he managed to stow away.Reed claims that he and his friend were followed everywhere they went, their lives threatened, and Reed\'s house ransacked. The alien, which had miraculously come back to life, was gone. Reed says that he had to live underground for 2 years, and could not get even one UFO group to help him with his story.He also claims to have been shot during the years following the ordeal. He has spoken before several UFO groups, and written a book on his experience, 'Link--An Extraterrestrial Odyssey' Reed Alien2\tReed Alien3Just recently, his credibility has suffered greatly. Until Reed can substantiate his claims, he is considered a charlatan and flim flam man. Usually, when you hear a story that is too good to be true, it is. I have been asked many times why my website contains mostly older sightings, and abductions. This is exactly why. See the following letter:B JShawn Atlanti, Founder and former Director of San Diego UFO Society, no longer supports or considers the 'Alien in the Forest Encounter' or what is known as the Dr. Jonathan Reed story to be real. This story occurred in mid-October 1996 in the Cascade Mtns in Washington state. I became aware of this story on October 21st, 1996, a few weeks later on November 11th, Jonathan Reed and Robert Raith went on the Art Bell Show and told their story, they were both on two later shows in 1998, and I was on another show with them in December of 1999.There were more allegations against Jonathan Reed that occurred on the Jeff Rense radio program on May 2nd, 2002, in which Royce Myers, Kathleen Anderson, Bill Werner and Denise Charvet appear.Bill Werner and Denise Charvet knew Jonathan Reed very well before October 1996, Both stated that his real name is Jonathan Bradley Rutter and told about information about his personal history that is contrary to what Jonathan has been stated on radio shows, in public lectures, Websites, etc,This information is available at the Website www.ufowatchdog.com, and may be heard in the archive section of the Jeff Rense radio program at www.Rense.com. This latest information, along with other related problems the last 3 and half years, combined with Jonathan Reed/Rutter unwillingness to have his supposed evidence (video, slides, pictures, etc,) tested at qualified laboratories or facilities and those results made public of the analysis in a printed form. Jonathan Reed/Rutter made a statement just about 3 and half years ago on the first Art Bell show that he would be open to do this. So, I FINALLY made the decision drop my support and belief in the Jonathan Reed story, now really known as Jonathan Bradley Rutter. Shawn Atlanti may reconsider the Jonathan Reed story if all of the following conditions are met:An investigation of Jonathan Reed/Rutter in what would be termed Police/FBI styled investigation of the following areas.1. Complete background check of his employment history, education, family, close friends, etc,2. Proof of the dog known as Suzy in his story through Dog Licenses veterinarian records, etc.3. The location/address of the house that Jonathan Reed/Rutter claimed he lived in at the time of this Encounter event, and proof that he rented it from the so-called Larry Arthur, now really known as Larry Sieber, and that Larry Sieber really owned it.4. Full names of two other characters in his story, Dolly and Gary, so that they or their familles can be contacted and interviewed.5. As stated before; A complete testing of the supposed evidence from his Encounter experience.(videos, slides, pictures, negatives, etc,). The results of that testing and analysis published in a written form from the laboratory or facility, and the address/phone number of that laboratory/facility, so one is able verify the results.6. A forensic examination of the supposed gunshot wound in Jonathan Reed/Rutter shoulder by a qualified Doctor/Pathologist, and those results made public.7. There are probably other areas that need investigation, but these are good for a start.Many have been claiming the Jonathan Reed story to be a hoax/fraud, and I will now have to agree with them, unless Jonathan Reed/Rutter and his associates can prove the above conditions just listed. I probably should have came to this conclusion a long time ago, but either due own my proclivity to procrastinate, my fascination for conspiracy side of the UFO subject matter, or the gullible side of myself, I have waited this long to make this decision.Hopefully, in the near future, Jonathan Reed/Rutter will be out of the UFO business and he can try something else, and we can bring a little more sanity to the UFO subject.Regards to all interested and concerned,written by: Shawn AtlantiThe Reed website has closed down since I first assembled this article, but at the time of this writing, Summer of 2002, the Reed site carried the following message on the front page. Take it with a grain of salt, the official homepage for garcinia also has an interesting message on the front page.A note from the webmaster;Recent allegations have come to light that Jonathan created a false identity. I have received communications this week from Jonathan admitting that he, indeed, created a false identity - Dr. Jonathan Reed. He asserts that he did so in an effort to protect family and friends from the ridicule and harassment associated with cases of this nature. He further asserts that, despite claims to the contrary, the encounter did, in fact, happen.After a great deal of deliberation, I have decided to temporarily keep the OdysseyLink site intact (with some minor exceptions *) instead of taking it down while we get the whole story for the following substantive reasons;... continue at Odyssey website.', 'UFO CASEBOOK HOME PAGE'Dead Alien body recovered.' This claim has been made too many times without validating evidence. As time goes by, these fantastic stories fade away and are forgotten. In most cases, debunkers stand by their status quo anthem; 'It couldn\'t happen, therefore it didn\'t. Those of us who honestly seek the truth of the UFO mystery are always looking for that one account that may fill in the missing pieces to the age oldquestion, 'Are We Alone?' One compelling account of an Alien body has come to us at a snails pace from the former Soviet Union, along with still frames of a video. This video tape is still under wraps in the State of Georgia, Russia.This tantalizing story comes from the Georgian UFO Association (GUFORA). They make the claim that a dead alien body was recovered by the Russian State Security Service in 1996. According to their report, an elderly woman who lived in the village of Kashtim came across the small bodied creature as she walked near her village in the vicinity of the Ural Mountains. Picking up what she thought was a baby that was ill and abandoned, she took the child home with her to nurse it back to health.After two weeks of caring for the child, the old woman became ill, and was hospitalized.Too afraid to reveal her secret, she left what she thought was a Godsend companion at home alone, and the creature died. The poor old woman confided in hospital officials, and the Kashtim Police Department intervened. They proceeded to the woman\'s house, and found the dead body on August 13, 1996. The corpse was filmed with a VHS video camera, and an investigation was completed. Radiation measurements were taken, but no abnormal readings were found. The being was measured at 8 and one-half inches in length. Soon after reports were made, the alien body was confiscated by the State Security, formerly KGB. At the present time, I am trying to get further details of this case, and will post them when and if any new information is received.source:Georgian UFO Association, (GUFORA)(B J Booth)<!--google_ad_client = 'pub-7518747415195612';/* 728x90, created 7/4/08 */google_ad_slot = '5690704701';google_ad_width = 728;google_ad_height = 90;//-->BACK to Case files indexUFO CASEBOOK HOME PAGE', 'The Alien Interview / Area 51Area 51: The Alien Interview video is color video footage claimed to have been obtained by a man who identifies himself only as 'Victor,' who purports it to be of an extraterrestrial being interrogated at a government facility.Victor maintains the footage was copied from a top-secret video originally recorded at Area 51. For fear of having his identity pinpointed, he never specifies whether he was an employee at the facility, but vaguely states that he 'had reason to be present at Area 51... more than once.'Though the Alien Interview documentary states the copy was smuggled out of Area 51, Victor once again strays from details by never specifically saying where the copying took place. He merely insists that an instance of 'data leaking' occurred during a massive transfer of video documentation from video analog to digital disc storage in a '(lower) security system.' Victor took advantage of the circumstances to copy the footage.On July 26, 1996, after several unsuccessful attempts to get network television companies to view and subsequently air his video, Victor contacted Rocket Pictures, an independent home video distribution company based in Los Angeles. Company president Tom Coleman, though reluctant at first, agreed to produce a documentary based on the video after his telephone conversation with Victor. Coleman sought the opinion of outside experts before going forth with making the documentary, and invited ufologist Sean David Morton to view the video.On March 13, 1997, Morton, being interviewed by Art Bell on the Coast to Coast AM radio show, made mention of the video and described it in great detail, thus marking it the first time the general public became aware of the video\'s existence. Victor himself would be interviewed by Bell just two months later. Calling from a phone and using a device to alter his voice, Victor also went into detail over the contents of the video. The alleged alien in an interrogation room. The video is approximately two minutes and 55 seconds in length. It contains the bold white characters 'DNI/27' imposed in the bottom left corner while a clock that runs upwards from '04:00:18:15' to '04:03:12:25' during the duration of the video appears in the bottom center.A diminutive being that fits the description of that of the Greys is seated at a rectangular table. The subject, which Victor says was brought to Area 51 after its craft was shot down in 1989, is situated behind the end of the table farthest from where the video is being shot and is behind a large piece of glass which Victor describes as part of a 'bio-containment area' meant to protect the alleged alien from microbes and viruses. Reflected in the glass is what appears to be two television monitors. The alien\'s head appears to be covered in bruises and what Morton suggests is a heart monitor can be seen on the table in front of the being.A person who Victor claims is a military officer attempting to communicate with the alien telepathically can be seen in the left foreground, while a more casually-dressed human figure can alternately be seen entering/leaving the video in the right foreground. The room where the interview is taking place is very dimly lit, so darkness obscures the two and reveals them as nothing more than two unrecognizable shadowy figures. For the same reason, only the creature\'s head is continuously visible, while brief glimpses of its torso are also shown.About halfway through the video, the alien becomes visibly distressed and appears to begin suffering from violent spasms and bouts of choking/gagging. The military officer signals for two medics, wearing scrubs and masks, to come to the aid of the convulsing alien. The medics shine a flashlight into its facial orifices, and one begins to wipe foam away from its mouth. At this point the video ends. It contains no audio, which Victor says he deliberately removed so that he could protect the anonymity of those who appear in the video.The footage has the characters DNI/27 burnt into the bottom line of the frame, along with what appears to be the time code numbers for date, minutes and seconds. The letters DNI could be an acronym for the Department of Naval Intelligence, the group responsible for the Area 51 base, a fact not many people know about. The DNI connection to Area 51 has been widely investigated. George Knapp, the TV journalist who encouraged Bob Lazar to go public with his knowledge has shown that Lazar\'s pay cheques from the time he claimed to be working at Area 51 had DNI stamped on them.  Source & References:www.abovetopsecret.comwww.wikipedia.com', 'Valley, Alabama, USA, UFO Photograph Taken, 1996  An ISUR NEWS Special: a local radio station and newspaper received six different photos from an anonymous source that show a capsule-shape UFO hovering over a farm pasture. In a letter accompanying the photos, the source claims to have taken the remarkable UFO photographs on the 16th of September, 1996, in Valley, Alabama, USA.According to the phototaker,  he was repairing a fence on his property when his dog started barking loudly. Going over to where his dog was he looked up to see a low-flying capsule-shape UFO hovering and moving slowly over one of his cow pastures. The UFO captured in each of the photos resembles the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo space capsules that the United States launched in the early years of its space program. Black to dark green, the cone-shaped capsule, when blown-up, shows a black teflon-like covered bottom and a flange or rim that goes around near the top of the unknown object. In each photo the UFO is shown at a slightly different position and elevation, making it more difficult to hoax, according to researchers who have examined the photographs. The photos and a copy of the letter were aired publicly for the first time on TV-33 in Lagrange, Georgia on 26 September 1996. On the 'Heston & Steve' show, the two hosts, Heston Yates and Steve Smoots, along with John C. Thompson and Jimmy Smith, field investigators for the International Society for Ufo Research (ISUR), speculated about whether the UFO photos are real. All of them agreed that if the photos were part of a hoax, it was a most strange and clever one. Mr. Thompson said on the program that he was 'most favorably impressed by the photos.' He also has stated since then that he has two witnesses who saw similar shaped UFOs in May and July in the LaGrange area which is only 20 miles from Valley. Another witness that he has located, says he and others saw the exact craft, incredibly, 25 years earlier in Atlanta. Mr. Smith, a long-time investigator and actual sightee of UFOs, said the photos appeared genuine. He also said that he himself, in 1971, had seen a UFO with a likeness of what the photos depict. He then went on to relate that the 1971 UFO had cut off power to his pickup while he observed it. The photos, along with a copy of the letter from the alleged phototaker, have now been sent to Jeff Sainio, a photography expert who specializes in analyzing UFO video and photos. Mr. Sainio, who often does photo analysis for the popular TV Sightings program, will determine if the photos really show a UFO. In the meantime, it is hoped that the person who took these amazing photos will step forward and allow access to the negatives that the photos were made from. All persons involved in investigating the photos are assuring the phototaker over TV and radio that if he wishes, his anonymity will be kept. Editor\'s Note: This case has good detail and a nice, clear photograph. I rarely ever add my own opinion into articles that are kept on the UFO Casebook. In this case, however, I must say that there is something just not quite right about the photograph. It has the look of a wooden water bucket turned upside down. In all fairness, I have NO proof to back up this statement, and I am keeping an open mind. Does anyone else agree with me on this?', 'The Varginha, Brazil EntityAbout 12:00 A.M. January 20, 1996: NORAD (North American Air Defense Command) contacts their Brazilian counterpart CINDACTA (I Centro INtegrado de Defesa Aerea e Controle de Trafego Aereo or Integrated Center on Air Defense and Air Traffic Control) and warns them of a UFO coming down over southern parts of the state.This information is leaked by both a Brazilian Air Force soldier, and an employee at the radar facility at Air Force Base VI Comar. Farmers Augusta and Eurico Rodrigues\' sleep is rudely interrupted by the frightened sounds of their farm animals. Attempting to find the cause, they peek out the window, seeing the animals running from one side of the field to the other.Peering into the night sky, they see a silent UFO without lights.When emergency departments receive a call that someone has seen a 'strange creature,' usually a good laugh is had by all. At first, that is exactly what happened at a Varginha, Brazil Fire Department on the morning of January 20, 1996.This case of the unknown began early that morning with a frantic phone call stating that a 'strange creature' had been seen in the area of Jardim Andere. Thinking that the reporter was probably someone who was drunk, or been up too long partying, this first call was in the process of being reluctantly responded to when a second call came in stating the same thing.The Fire Department personnel in Brazil are part of the Military, and must respond to all calls. What could this be, a couple of pranksters perpetuating a hoax? If so, the group was growing, as several more calls came in also reporting this unusual monster. Firemen followed the civilians\' instructions to the site.To the utter surprise of the men, they found the source of the strange reports. The entity was seemingly in a dazed condition, and was easily captured by the search party. Three protrusions stood atop of it\'s head, which glowed with red eyes.It also had long arms, short legs, and big feet. The monster sounded off with a buzz as it was taken into a net approximately 2 and one-half hours after the first call was received. Was this some type of 'one of kind' alien who was visiting our world?Whatever it was, it was not alone. Later that very day, three girls, Lilliane Fatima, Valquira Fatima, and Andrade Xavier, were walking home after work. Taking a short-cut through a wooded area, they stumbled upon another one of these strange alien creatures. Their description of the entity was almost identical to the one nabbed earlier.Picking up their pace, they raced home. One of the girls\' mothers immediately went back to the spot of the sighting, saw foot prints, and smelled a strong scent of ammonia in the air. This was not the end of the creatures by any means.There were reports of as many as seven being captured that day. One was supposedly taken to a small regional hospital before being transferred to the larger Humanitas facility.Reports stated that the creature was escorted by military personnel. At least one of the creatures expired, and was taken for an autopsy to the University of Campinas. Reportedly, two others were taken to the University of Sao Paulo for examination.During the autopsy process, certainly many photographs and videos were taken, but so far, nothing has been released to the public save for an artist\'s rendition of the creature. Only a few weeks after the events of January 20, Marco Eli Cherese, a 23 year old military policeman who was involved in the investigation, died.Supposedly he fell ill from the effects of contact with one of the creatures. The press began a relentless search for more details of the case, and two of the girls involved began to ask for monetary compensation for their testimony. The mother of the girls, Mrs. Luiza Helena, states that she was offered a fair sum of money by four unknown men dressed in cream-colored Armani suits.This time, however, the money was to silence the testimony, not solicit it. 'They also said they would come back, but we can\'t hide the truth,' she said.Witnesses to Being When questioned by the press, Military and Fire Department members denied any knowledge of a captured alien. This response did not come as a surprise. There were reports of an unusual amount of troop movement on the day of the monsters, indicating a cover-up.Officially speaking, all personnel at the hospitals involved denied any knowledge of the events involving the capture of any alien being. It would be only natural for those involved to be under an oath of silence, but there is one indication that the strange stories may have credibility.Pathologist Badan Palhares, who reportedly was the physician who autopsied one of the creatures, officially denied any involvement in the events, but did state that he may have more to say at a later time. Could this be a hint of an announcement to come?Several reports of UFOs were also made during the period in question, and it is surmised that the strange beings were occupants of the flying craft. There is also a possible connection to the Chupacabra monster, who has been reported many times in the South American area.The story of the Varginha entities are largely a product of Ufologist Vitorio Pacaccini, who claims to have received firsthand reports from military and hospital personnel who spoke 'off the record.'The Varginha, Brazil accounts are still in need of more 'official' confirmation, but such is the case of many reports of this type.Hopefully, we will receive information to shed new light on this tantalizing case. Besides the drawings of the entity, there is also a UFO video taken on the same night over Varginha.', '1996 - South Africa Police Chase/Film UFOFair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

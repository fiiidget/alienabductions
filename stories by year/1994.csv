1994,1994-UFO Sighting of Flight AF-3532On January 28, 1994, at the beginning of the afternoon, the crew of Air-France flight AF-3532 (Nice to London) observed an unusual phenomenon. UFOCOM asked some questions to the pilot and commander of the flight, Jean-Charles Duboc. INTERVIEW OF COMMANDANT DUBOC:You were a flight commanding officer at AIR France and on January 28, 1994, you have encountered an unusual phenomenon as you were doing the Nice to London flight 3532. Could you tell what you witnessed? I was indeed commander of flight AF-3532 of January 28, 1994, with copilot Valerie Chauffour, and 24 passengers on board. I have kept a copy of the 'OCTAVE', which is the data-processing follow-up of the flight and I can specify that above the Paris area at the altitude of 11700 meters (FL 390), the outside temperature was of minus 59 Celsius degrees, and with a wind from the North-West had a speed of1 80 km/h (311°/101 kts). The visibility was of more than 300 km (150 Nm) and the cloud cover consisted of altocumulus. The flight encountered no air shakes. The navigation was under excellent weather conditions, in spite of the facing wind of almost 130 km/h (70 kts). That gave us a ground speed of 650 km/h (350 kts). The takeoff hour in Nice was 00h56PM UT and the arrival hour in London 02:13PM UT. It was a particularly calm flight, without particular problem. We arrived above Coulommiers when a steward who was in the cockpit noticed an object which he thought could be a weather balloon. This object was then seen by the copilot and myself a few moments afterwards. According to their description it seemed to have a variable form and to come very quickly across our road. I first identified it like an aircraft facing us, at approximately 45 km (25 Nm), at an altitude of approximately 10500 meters (25 Nm) and at an angle close to 45°. I found this slope absolutely abnormal because aircraft are not inclined at this altitude beyond 30 degrees without risking to fall down. This object seemed to us then absolutely abnormal by its size which seemed immense, its dark red color and of the fuzzy edges. I had the impression to observe a gigantic lens in evolution. It did not resemble anything we had seen in our flying careers. This object, this phenomenon, remained motionless while we left it on our left side, still at an approximate distance of 45 km. We observed it during a good minute, conscious that we were seeing something utterly anomalous. We continued to observe it when it gradually merged with the environment. We saw it becoming translucent, transparent, diluted in space. That was absolutely amazing. After some interrogations we contacted the control center of Rheims to announce this unidentified object to them, as we are required by air transportation regulation. Was this 'object' tracked by your instruments? What about he black box of flight 3532? Were the communications between your aircraft and the control center in Rheims recorded? Our ON BOARD instruments are not intended to locate other aircraft. The airborne radar is only intended to locate storms in order to be able to avoid the air movements ascending and descending, associated with them, characteristic of these clouds, the cumulonimbus. During this event the radar was not in operation, as it is only necessary in instrument flying (IFR). In the same way, the black box cannot in any case detect aircraft or phenomena far away from the plane. On the Airbus 320 there is a first recorder which is the Quick Access Recorder (QAR). It records only flight parameters, speed, altitude, mechanics, engines, electric, etc. It is analyzed by the maintenance service. The second recorder, the DFDR, has the same recordings but must support the constraints of an accident. This recorder is analyzed only if a crash occurs or on request of the crew. As no parameter of our flight has been modified, the tapes were not analyzed because it would have been pointless. The UFO was at nearly 45 km of our aircraft, and there has been no electric or magnetic disturbances. On the other hand this UFO was approximately 10 km above Paris, and the Parisian people, under layer of clouds, were much closer to the UFO than we were. If there had been electromagnetic disturbances, a few million people would have noticed it. The communications were always preserved, and it is the same for the main TV and radio shows! Which were the continuations of this affair, at a professional and personal level? Have you been interviewed by the civilian or military authorities? In the immediate, the continuations were non-existent, because I did not submit a written report to avoid being ridiculed. It was three years later, as I read an article from Paris Match, which described how a UFO has been detected above Paris, that I made the connection between this UFO and that what I had seen. I then submitted a report to the Gendarmerie Nationale (French police, having an SOP for collection of UFO reports). Was your testimony transmitted to the SEPRA? Which were the continuations brought by this branch of the CNES? My report was transmitted by the Gendarmerie to the SEPRA, and the UFO Committee, was created within the framework of the Association of the Former Auditors of the Institute for the High Studies of National Defense (IHEDN). I was heard during nearly one hour and half by the group chaired by General Denis Letty. After discussing about the observation, we concluded that the object was approximately 300 meters in diameter. I took note of the radar recordings by the CODED (Operational Center of Air Defense). There is a very curious characteristic for the trajectory of the UFO, as it shows that it would have almost collided with us. The minimal distance on the recording is less than 1 Nm, that is to say 10 seconds of flight. This kind of observation is traditional in electronic war. The modern military aircraft are furtive, and at the same time able to synthesize a virtual image of themselves by delaying the radar echo. If a missile had been drawn on this UFO, which was above Paris, it would be our A320 which would probably have been hit by the missile. I think that it is not desirable to shoot fire at this kind of phenomenon. Did you speak again of your observation with your colleagues of flight 3532? Which is, now, their feeling about this affair? I never found the steward who was in the cockpit. My various requests to find the list of the crew for this flight were left unanswered by the of the commercial flight crew personal management (PNC). I had indeed four crew in two days, and I did not keep the lists of the members with me, because they are on the on board documentation. On the other hand I have reexamined the case several times with the copilot who has a very precise memory of the event, and who wrote a report for the gendarmerie (police) of the Charles De Gaulle Airport. I can only suggest you asking them about their feeling now. During your pilot career, have you heard from colleagues or other air personal, of similar phenomena? I barely speak about this encounter, and I had the surprise to note that about one out of ten pilot had observed a unidentified flying phenomenon. Your testimony appears in the COMETA Report, page 11, which has been published in a special edition of the VSD magazine, this summer 1999. Were you interviewed by this association? What do you think of this report, from a general point of view? As I said, I was actually auditioned by the above mentioned UFO Committee, which took shape in an association named COMETA. I have recently met Mr. Denis Letty along with a friend who is flight commander on the Concorde, responsible for the training of pilots at the General Management of Civil Aviation (DGAC), in order to study a regulatory possibility to have a reports form for UFO observations on the board of all French airliners. Their report seemed to me extremely well conceived, written by high level personalities, and constitutes a reference for UFO question. It still has some restricted diffusion because this subject is still one of the three great taboos of aeronautics. The first taboo is the cosmic radiation on aircraft. From May 2000 on, the flying personal will have to carry a dosimeter and the amount of radiation received each year will be measured and calculated according to the recommendations of the project SIEVERT which is developed by the General Management of Civil Aviation, the Institute of Protection and Nuclear Safety (IPSN), the Office of Protection against radiation Ionizing (OPRI), and the Observatory of Paris-Meudon. Flight crew of aeronautics, as well as astronauts will be soon classified among the people who receive amounts of radiations on their workplace. The amount of cosmic radiation received by passengers or members of flight crew during a Europe to US trip and return trip is similar to a lung radioscopy, and this fact is carefully hidden to the crews and the passengers since nearly 35 years. Indeed, a recommendation of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), back in 1964, requested that the airlines take measurements of on board radiations on airliners. A modification of the European regulation in May 2000, European directive 96/29 of May 13, 1996, divided by five the maximum amount of radiation applicable to the public, which will be able to take only 1 millisievert per year, instead of five. The airline pilots, hostesses, steward receive between two and five MVS per year, which is more than the majority of the workers in nuclear power plants. This taboo will disappear when the information circulates in the general public. The second taboo is the suicide of the airline pilots as they fly, and it will be shattered by the accident of the EGYPTAIR 990 flight, if the assumption of the suicide of the copilot is to be confirmed. The third taboo is the UFO phenomenon UFO, and in particular the 220 visual observations confirmed by radar, among them is mine. We can thank the COMETA team which, by the quality of its members, its knowledge, its overview, its hypothesis, makes it possible to start to discuss seriously about the sightings from all points of the planet. On December 7, 1999, TV viewers have an occasion to see you in the 'Why? How?' show, animated by Sylvain Augier and Julie Bhaud, for the France3 channel. As I took part myself in the recording of this show, I had the pleasant impression that the questions were not 'oriented.' The 'And CO' team (producing the show) seemed opened, although skeptic, and very sympathetic. If the editing does not suppress it, do you think that this kind of show can have some utility for general public? What do you think about the attitude of the medias, in general, as for their editing of UFO related information? As I wrote above, there are several taboos in aeronautics, and the reporters who dare to face these interdict risk to be ridiculed, but also to have trouble finding a job. This type of show require curiosity and courage, and the journalists know that they risk negative reactions, or aggressive reactions, and derision. This type of emission is very important for it makes it possible to give previously confidential information to the public. Information must pass gradually, whereas we must know that there will be all sorts of reactions. The bottom line of this problem is the maturity of the public. Is the public ready to receive the information? The social psychologists can consider the consequences which an official meeting with an extraterrestrial civilization would have, if they have several million years of technological advance. Which upheavals would be induced? Will there be panic in the population? Which disappointed hopes? Will we find the best, the worst, or both? Which information should be given to the public? Today, do you think that the origin of the UFO phenomenon is not our planet? The immensity of the universe, its beauty, its unknown features, the current technological progress, the space travels, the orbiting stations, and what I saw, can only convince me that we are not alone in the universe and that we will take part, if we do not destroy ourselves, in the community of the species which travel across the galaxy. The true current problem of our planet is not the existence, or not, of extraterrestrial civilizations but all the problems caused by pollution, the accumulation of the weapons of destruction, fanaticism, totalitarianism, the overcrowding of our planet.

He and his wife, Lise, have been with MUFON  Ontariosince then. Tom is now Deputy Director of MUFON Ontario, in Toronto.This case has had much coverage in the media. Tabloid televisionshows like \'Unsolved Mysteries\', \'Sightings\' and \'Encounters\' havegiven it much  air-time, as have cable-tv stations all over NorthAmerica. Internationally,  magazines  newspapers  and  news-letters   havedevoted  hundreds of pages to it and UFO conferences around the  planethave  intrigued  many  thousands  of  attendees  with  it\'s   seeminglystartling details.   \'Carp\'  has  achieved \'One Of The Most Significant  Cases  In  UFOHistory\'  status. You\'ve  probably heard,  seen and  read  about  ityourself. In  this  and succeeding issues we\'ll deal with the FACTS  of  thecase. We\'ll  describe the events,  as  told by the media and as we\'veexperienced them - and we\'ll try not appear too judgemental.Beginnings - 1989     Tom  Theofanous,  working with The Canadian UFO  Research  Network(CUFORN),   received   a  package  from  someone   calling   themselves\'Guardian\'.   It had no return address.     'The  package contained a story about a UFO crash that  supposedlyhappened close to Carlton Place,  which is about a half-hour drive fromOttawa',  Tom  said.    'There  was also a photo-copied picture  of  anAlien.'     'For  the  most part,  we thought it was  a  joke.    But,  CUFORNdirector Harry Tokarz decided to call Arthur Bray, a well-respected UFOauthor  and  researcher  who lives in Ottawa,  and ask him  if  he  hadsomeone in the Carlton area who could check out the story for us.    Asluck  would  have it,  Arthur knew a fellow who was fascinated  by  thefield of ufology, Graham Lightfoot.' Graham,  with  what was to become typical thoroughness,  used  thesomewhat  sketchy  co-ordinates  he got from Arthur Bray  to  not  onlypinpoint  the \'UFO crash-site\' near Manion Corners,  but also locate  anumber of witnesses.     One of those witnesses,  Diane Labanek,  claimed that on the nightof November 4th 1989,  she saw an intense,  bright light pass overhead,heading towards a swamp at the far end of the field behind and south ofher  home.  She  said  she also saw several  helicopters  earlier  thatevening using bright lights to scan the area.     Another  West Carlton resident recalled that that was the  weekendwhen  some cattle escaped from a nearby pasture and that it  took  tilllate Sunday to round them up.     A couple told Graham about the wife being scared by a very  brightlight shone through their south-facing bathroom window.    'It  reachedright  down our hallway!'.   The wife also mentioned that  she  vaguelyremembered hearing the sound of helicopters at the time.     Others talked of 'dogs and cattle being disturbed'.     Many  people could think of absolutely nothing  unusual  happeningduring  the  course  of  the weekend,  including a  couple  who  had  atelescope set-up.     Graham  reported those findings to CUFORN,  along with results  ofhis  examination of the field and swamp behind Labanek\'s home  -  therewere  no signs on the ground,  anywhere,  of the heavy  equipment  thatwould be needed to recover a \'crashed craft\'.     His report closed with,  'although I could find nothing conclusiveto support or disprove any of the witnesses claims.  I shall check backaround the area later this summer.'     The  same  Guardian  material  had  been  sent  to  several  otherinvestigators, researchers and UFO groups and as the story spread, boththe  former Provincial Director of MUFON Ontario Clive Nadin,  and  thecurrent  Quebec Director Christian Page,  visited the area on  separateoccasions,  and  spoke  to the \'witnesses\'.    They  confirmed  GrahamLightfoot\'s initial findings and agreed with Tom & Harry at CUFORN thatsomeone was 'trying to put us on - a hoax!'Guardian re-surfaces - 1991     In the middle of October 1991 CUFORN began receiving more Guardian\'information\' via the mail and all postmarked \'Ottawa\'.     An  envelope  with  some documents  that  mention  a  \'conspiracy\'between  the Chinese and  \'Grey Aliens that are planning to  take  overthe world\', arrived first.   Then came a Polaroid photograph of a \'UFO\'flying across an unidentified road.  A while later came a black & whitepicture of a grey-type \'Alien\'.     The  fourth delivery in the series was a package.    It  containedthe  now  infamous VHS video tape with a green label on  the  cassette,with a thumb print and the word GUARDIAN printed on the label.     There were also three playing cards in the package,  all with handwritten notes on them - an Ace, King and Joker.     A  photo-copied map showed the \'Grey\'s landing area\',  along  withnotes  explaining  that the flares in the video were used to  help  theUFO,  which  can out maneuver anything on the planet,  fly  under  theradar and know where to land!     There   were  also  \'Canadian  Department  of   National   Defensedocuments\'  enclosed - which,  upon later investigation,  proved to  beforgeries.     These \'documents\',  it is thought,  were designed to look like theofficial documents on UFOs that Canadian UFO author/researcher  StantonFriedman  acquired,  via  \'The Freedom of Information  Act\',  from  theUnited States Government.     The  video - a few minutes long - showed two different  angles  ofwhat Guardian alleges was an \'alien craft\', on the ground.     First,  a long shot of bright lights clumped together to the rightof  the  scene and what looked like four red emergency road  flares  orfires in barrels on the left side of the screen.     The  second  scene  showed the same clump of  bright  lights  fromapproximately  the  same distance but more to the  centre  without  anyflares and the sound of a single dog barking in the distance.     The third scene was only three frames long and was a close-up of aa pair of wipers half-way across a very Earth-bound vehicle!     CUFORN pondered what to do with all the Guardian information  thatarrived  in October of \'91 and decided,  that in view of the  season  -winter,  that  they  would hold off visiting Carlton  until  after  thespring run-off.Enter Oechsler     At the beginning of March \'92, Bob Oechsler (pronounced Bob Ex-ler)an American MUFON investigator - who describes himself a  \'former  NASAmission specialist\'  - called CUFORN from his home in Maryland.     Apparently,  he  too  had  received a  video  and  documents  fromGuardian,  although when comparisons of the two videos were  discussed,his had an additional scene - a somewhat closer one minute shot of  the\'alien craft\'.     His version also had a couple of minutes worth of the  windshield,plus several still shots of the \'Grey Aliens\'.     The most important difference,  however,  was that his version  ofthe  tape  had no audio-track at all - 'it seems it  was  intentionallyremoved', says Tom Theofanous.     Oechsler had shown the tape to Bruce Macabbee and they agreed  thatwhat they saw was a UFO and should be investigated further - and that\'swhy  Oechsler  called Tom at CUFORN.   They agreed they would  meet  inCarlton, Ontario on May 10th 1992.     Tom  then called and spoke with Graham Lightfoot,  for  the  firsttime, and Graham agreed to act as guide for the May meeting.     It  transpired  that  Graham worked for The O.F.A  -  The  OntarioFederation  of Agriculture - and knew the Carlton area and its  farmerswell.       The First Visit       On  May  10th,  Mother\'s  Day,  1991,  Torontonians,  Tom  &  LiseTheofanous,  Victor  Lourenco,  Vaughn [LAST NAME?,  Drew  Williamson,Harry Tokarz and Wayne St.  John met with Oechsler,  his son and GrahamLightfoot  at the motel the Oechslers were staying at in West  Carlton,near Ottawa, Ontario.     They  all  had  breakfast together as  Oechsler  told  many,  manyfascinating  stories.    Eventually they ended up in  Oechsler\'s  motelroom to compare their copies of the Guardian video.     'Oechsler,  despite being an expert in video analysis, had a greatdeal  of difficulty connecting my video camera up to the tv set in  hisroom  so that we could play back the Guardian videos.   In  retrospect,his combination of technical ineptness and more story telling seemed tobe a stalling tactic', said Tom.       They  stopped  at  a spot off Highway 7 near  Manion  Corners  andGraham  pointed  out the direction from which the 1989 \'UFO\'  had  comewhen  it \'crashed\',  and where the Labanek\'s house was in  relation  towhere the group was standing.     Oechsler  seemed  to  be stalling once  more,  shooting  video  ofeverything.     Finally, they set off again.     'This  time  Oechsler took the lead,  with me  following  him  andGraham  who\'s supposed to be our guide following me!'   Tom  says.   'Ithought at the time that this was pretty odd.    How did Oechsler,  whosupposedly had never been to Canada,  let alone this area before,  knowhis  way,  using  side-roads  and making the correct  turns toward  ourdestination?'       Earlier,  Oechsler  had  asked  the Toronto  group  to  check  foranomalies  on  their compasses while they  were  driving,  because  theGuardian papers described magnetic changes in certain parts of the areathe group was travelling in.     'So, we\'re driving down a small hill when Oechsler braked suddenlyup ahead of us, stopped and came back to our car to tell me that he hadfound an anomaly on his two compasses', Tom recounts, 'now, he had bothof his laying in the back of his pick-up on the metal floor where  theywere  bouncing around.    His son was keeping an eye on them  from  thecab.  I told him that the three compasses,  we were holding in the palmsof our hands,  in our car didn\'t waver at all.    But, he insisted thathe\'d go back up the hill, by himself, and check again.'     While  the  rest of the group stood around waiting  for  Oechsler,Drew  Williamson  noticed  a Stop-sign at the end of  a  long  drivewayleading to an abandoned farmhouse with a For-Sale sign on it.     Tom  continues - 'I looked through my binoculars at the  Stop-signand  saw  that it was propped up by rocks.    There  were  other  signsaround it that read \'Do Not Enter\' and \'DND Killing Fields\'.   The lastone  had  pictographs  of tanks,  helicopters and  weapons  on  it  andappeared to be riddled with bullet-holes.       'So,  out of curiosity, we went over to the signs and looked  moreclosely.'     'We  found  tracks  left by cars and what might  have  been  four-wheeled vehicles, leading into the property.   We felt that perhaps thefield  around  the old farm house was being used for \'War Games\'  -  ormaybe even was the location used for the Guardian video.'     'Why?   Because the terrain was perfect - lots (200 acres) of openfield.   I also noticed a dog barking up at the house at the top of thehill.' said Tom.     This  would become significant later in identifying  the  possiblelocation of the Guardian video shoot.     'Eventually,  we  continued  along Corkery  Road.    But,  when  Imentioned to Oechsler that we should be interviewing the people in  theneighbourhood  we  were passing,  who were out sitting in  their  frontgardens  or working on their lawns,  he insisted that we look  for  the\'crash\' or \'landing\' sites.'     Guardian\'s  map  described an area about one and a  quarter  milessquare, which consisted of dense, knee-high scrub, and wet, swampland.       The  group  headed toward it,  using a path  beneath  high-tensionpower transmission lines that cut across below the southern end of  theLabanek\'s property.     Most  of them had great difficulty with the rough  conditions  andbecame  very  tired,  annoyed by biting mosquitoes and  soaked  by  theswampy  ground.  They gave about a half way into the swamp  and  headedback to the back to the parking lot.     Tom picks up the story again:   'Bob and his son continued to lookfor  the landing site as the rest of us left the swamp in a  couple  ofdifferent groups.   Lise,  Drew,  Wayne and I left first and drove  offlooking for a drink of cold pop.'     'When  we got back to the parking lot twenty  minutes  later,  thesecond  group out had left a note on our windshield saying they\'d  meetus at a restaurant twenty minutes away in Carp.   We left a note on theOechsler\'s truck windshield telling them where we\'d be.     'The first of our group to arrive at the restaurant ordered  theirfood  and  twenty minutes later the rest of us arrived and  placed  ourorders.'       'Thirty  minutes  later,  as  Oechsler and his  son  were  walkingthrough the door, I jokingly said: I bet he\'ll say he found the spot!'     'As  he sat down,  I asked him what had happened.   He smiled  andsaid he\'d found the spot.'     'I asked how he\'d managed to do that when we\'d left him a about  amile  from his car in a dense swamp halfway to the alleged site and  itwas getting dark.    There simply hadn\'t been enough time to get  thereexamine  the  \'site\'  and get back out to his truck and  drive  to  therestaurant.   He just smiled, but didn\'t answer.'     After they finished their dinner,  Drew, Victor and Vaughn decidedto leave for Toronto.     Graham  suggested  that  the  remainder  should  go  talk  to  theLabanek,  and he and Harry left ahead of Tom & Lise and the Oechslers,since Oechsler senior was still eating.    The seven of them would meetat the corner by the Labaneks.     'Lise,  Wayne  and I confronted Oechsler out in the  parking  lot,where the three of us had gone to discuss the days events privately.'       'I  asked him what he was trying to pull here.    He responded  byasking  'what\'s wrong with trying to make a buck?',   I  answered  thatthere  was  nothing  wrong  with making money  as  long  as  we  didn\'tcompromise our ethics.'     'Oechsler  came back with:  'No matter what or how good the  storyis,  50% of the people will believe you,  50% wont.    All you have  tocare about is the 50% that will'.     'It was at that point',  recalls Tom, 'that I decided to back awayfrom the investigation for a while to see what Oechsler would do.'     They  joined the others at Manion Corner by the Labaneks house  -Graham had knocked on their door but there was no one  home.  So,  theywaited, enjoying a pleasant early summer evening, talking.     The  Labaneks didn\'t get home till after 10 p.m,  which the  groupfelt was late to do an interview.   Graham and Oechsler would come  backthe next morning and talk to them     Tom finishes up this part of the story:  'I told Graham about  theconversation  that  I  had in the parking lot of  the  restaurant  withOechsler, after he left the restaurant.   Then Lise, Harry, Wayne and Ileft for Toronto, shaking our heads.'

Blue, white, red, and green lights, sometimes attached to cylindrical objects, and sometimes performing unusual maneuvers, were reported.911 operators began receiving calls at around 9:30 p.m. about something that looked like 'a string of Christmas lights way up in the sky.' It wasn\'t just a few people reporting these things; it was counties all up and down Lake Michigan. Some sources said 300 witnesses, including several police officers, saw the lights.There were so many reports that one of the Ottawa County 911 operators decided to call the National Weather Service radar operator at Muskegon. The conversations that 911 had with the NWS operator were taped and later made their way into the media. The radar operator\'s voice could be heard describing abrupt movements of the object and multiple objects appearing on the radar screen.He said that what he was seeing could not be precipitation, especially at that height. One object was tracked moving twenty miles in ten seconds.Holland police officer Jeff Vellhouse spoke to the operator of the Muskegon radar that picked up the radar tracks: 'He said he had three things on his radar, and they were in a triangular shape. He said they hovered over Holland and moved southwest. He said that one would move out of the triangular pattern, then move back in.'The radar operator also reported:'There were three and sometimes four blips, and they weren\'t planes. Planes show as pinpoints on the scope, these were the size of half a thumbnail. They were from 5 to 12,000 feet at times, moving all over the place. Three were moving toward Chicago. I never saw anything like it before, not even when I\'m doing severe weather.'It was said that there was no NWS written or taped records of the radar contacts themselves, but Dave Reinhart of BIMUP (Bureau of Investigators of Mysteries & Unusual Phenomena) claimed to have received copies of the NWS radar operator\'s report in late 1994. He also said that he had talked to an individual referred to as 'Fred', who worked at Area 51 and who had knowledge that what occurred on the night of March 8, 1994 was some sort of rendezvous of UFOs from the east, west, north, and south.Scott Ruiter of Grand Haven saw the lights in Grand Haven Township at 10:30 p.m. March 7: 'It looked like about five airplanes following each other fairly closely. One would blink, then the other, other and other, right to left,'The National Weather Service later tried to downplay the radar trackings: 'There is no relation between the UFOs and the radar tracks,' said Dean Gulezian, the weather service\'s area manager for Michigan. Gulezian said that although the radar did show some echoes, one key thing is the eyewitnesses saw these things at tree-top level, while the radar echoes were from an altitude of 10,000 feet or higher.'(Note above where the first witnesses reported seeing something like a string of Christmas lights 'way up in the sky')Randee Murphy and her husband, of Ada Township, observed a 'huge' shape for about two minutes as it flew slowly about 100 feet over the woods outside their home. 'It had four lights,' she said, and 'made a soft, whirring noise. It sounded like a single jet engine.'The Michigan flap continued for several days, presumably ending on the 10th. The sightings were never adequately explained.', ' 1994,  The Mongo Photo Case, Indiana, August 31Prime witness met and talked with two hunters the following day at 10:30 AM EDT. They had been enroute to the campground from Ft. Wayne, IN, and when they were 1/2 mile south of Mongo they spotted a white object move in front and to the east at low level at a high rate of speed. This was at the same time of 2130 EDT.  Newspaper accounts show at least two other good witnesses (the Martins) testifying that this was no blimp. Reports of a blimp (Family Channel) in area. Finally, a man, his wife, and two daughters saw the same or similar object at Hamilton, IN, and took videos. Their sighting was at 8:45 PM and a little over 20 miles SE of Mongo. The object was less than 100\' up and there was no sound. Although some of video was erased, the object in one scene is large, pear shaped, and definitely not a conventional object.  The blow-ups of the Mongo object were received on October 21st and were cropped negatives #8 & #9. JK had another pair of negatives at the time of the interview, #4 & #5. After making prints from #8 & #9 a few days prior to this interview, he had swapped negatives with the camera owner.  The witness says the first photos are more distinct. 'You are going to be more impressed with the ones I just got yesterday,' he said. Negatives #6 & #7 reportedly did not show the UFO. The blow-ups and prints were made on a department store customer-operated Kodak machine called 'Create-A-Print'.  Photo #8 shows object (moving west to east in downward course) with illuminated leaves in the foreground due to camera flash. Photo #9 is similar, w/o flash, object still moving west to east and downward. Camera flash had been turned off for #9.  In the first two photos the object had come closer and reportedly looked like a 'fried egg'.  I requested that he fill out a Form 1 and try to get the others (5) to do the same. Six Form 1\'s were provided.  A drawing was supplied with the blow-ups of negatives #8 & #9, and witness states that this is what the UFO looked like, as it was very bright and coming in, first like the moon. Object had panels that could be seen when the object was due south. He says drawing/photos don\'t do justice to the actual event. There was absolutely no noise. Three dogs did not react in any way.  He was out hunting the next day and actually saw the Family Channel Blimp that others had reported. 'There is no way in hell (that) we saw a blimp that night.'  The object they saw and photographed on the 31st was no further than 1/4 mile away, and from 500\' high to as low as 100\' at one point. Witness then states the object was more vivid when first coming in. Apparently the object was receding on subsequent shots. At first he thought the object to be a bright meteor. It didn\'t take long for them to realize that the object was not a meteor. In negative #4 & #5 you 'can see a distinct line right around the center', he said.  Preliminary EvaluationSource Test, Natural: All natural sources were eliminated. An EZC Skyplot for Mongo coordinates during time slot shows three planets as conspicuous targets. Jupiter and Venus were in the SW, Saturn was in the SE. Description of object, movement, and number of witnesses precludes a misidentification of an astronomical object. Also, an on-site investigation by John Timmerman of CUFOS failed to show any other natural source that might explain the sighting.  Source Test, Man-Made: Advertising, commercial, military, and private aircraft eliminated. A blimp seemed possible. Witness testimony appeared to rule this out. Later analysis by Dr. Richard Haines effectively ruled out any type of blimp or any other source. We had already eliminated a balloon, fixed structure, hoax (on witness or by witnesses). Twelve witnesses were reliable, object was real, description and photos (and a video) indicate an unidentified craft was in the area, along with a possible blimp.  Evaluation: Unidentified craft. Berliner Strangeness Scale: 2 (Night object); Berliner Credibility Scale: 7 (Still photo(s) by professional). Speiser Strangeness Factor: S5 (Highly strange; suggests intelligent guidance); Speiser Credibility Scale: P5 (Highly credible, leaving almost no doubt).  ConclusionsThe self-luminous aerial object seen and photographed at Mongo, Indiana on August 31, 1994, has remained unidentified after the various evaluations cited above. On the one hand, its overall shape and flight characteristics are not unlike many scores of other UFO reported for more than fifty years from around the world, many of which were captured on photographs. On the other hand, a blimp definitely was seen during the night of August 31, 1994 in the Mongo area. The aerial object photographed cannot be positively identified at this time. It remains a UFO.  Comments by the State DirectorWe have been unable to obtain any official flight records for any blimp flights explaining the Mongo event. Two different blimp companies were 'identified' (Family Channel & Virgin Lightship) by 'authorities'. A current and separate investigation is underway involving a video taken the same evening at Hamilton, Indiana just a few miles SE of Mongo! The witnesses also claim the object at one point was less than 100\' over them, was as big as a football field, and made no noise!  source:www.nicap.com', '1994 - The Trumbull County, Ohio, UFO IncidentPublished: 9:21 AM 3/28/2010by B J Booth, www.ufocasebook.comA series of unusual events unfolded on December 14, 1994, in Trumbull County, Ohio. Just after midnight on a late Fall night, a series of calls was received by 911 operators. These reports all involved one thing- reports of low-flying UFOs. The majority of these calls were heard by dispatcher Roy Anne Rudolph.Reports mostly related a fairly fast moving, unknown object / lights that seemed to be descending. Naturally at first, 911 operators thought the callers were seeing a balloon, plane, helicopter, or other everyday object.But, because of the extraordinary number of calls, Rudolph decided to notify the policemen of Liberty Township. The first police unit contacted thought that the reports were probably nothing to worry about, and that a plane was probably flying low.Sergeant Toby Meloro was the first officer on the scene, as he proceeded down Samson Drive to check out the lights. He was informed by a man on the street that the lights were moving south.As Meloro continued southerly on Samson Drive, suddenly his cruiser went dead. As he attempted to restart his vehicle, it was engulfed by a bright light from above.Startled and frightened, he exited his vehicle, and stood outside looking up at a giant object, circular in shape, and intensely bright in the center section.After about thirty seconds, the giant object moved away. One the most striking things about Meloro's sighting was that he heard not a sound from the UFO. After the object had moved out of sight, the police cruiser's functions returned to normal. Trying to understand what he had just seen, he took off in pursuit of the UFO.Meloro was unable to keep pace with the UFO. He called dispatch, informing them what he had seen, and gave the object's direction of flight.Soon, this information was related to all active law enforcement units in the area, and reports of the object's direction were used to triangulate the object, and enable units to move to its location.Dispatcher Rudolph later stated that at least 14-15 officers had seen the UFO. Their reports of the object and its movements were openly discussed among the officers on the police radio.Police dispatch, with reports of the UFO spreading to adjacent communities, called the local airport FAA control tower, and asked if they had anything unusual on their radar. Control tower stated that they had nothing unusual on their scope, which covered a 60 mile diameter around Youngstown.Researcher Kenny Young did an in-depth study of the Trumbull County sightings. His requests for Freedom of Information Act documents regarding the case was denied. He interviewed officers involved in the case, and was confident that they were telling the truth.Lieutenant James Baker, of the Brookfield Township Police Department, was one of the officers monitoring the fantastic calls, and decided to have a look for himself. He climbed up an abandoned radar tower in the area to get an optimum look at the object.As he reached the top of the tower, he was shocked at what he saw - not one, but three UFOs. The three objects were in a triangle pattern, with the middle object slightly higher than the two on the side.Also, Baker stated that the object changed colors in unison - red, yellow, blue, and green. He reported his observation to the other patrolmen on duty.Astronomers have tried to explain the sightings as simple stars that appeared low in the sky, and appear to change colors. Of course, this does not explain the malfunction of police vehicles, lights engulfing them, or objects moving across the landscape being chased by policemen.Some have theorized that the object seen by the policemen of Trumbull County was a top-secret craft from the Youngstown Air Reserve Base. However, Captain John Keytack, from the base, stated that there were no planes, experimental or otherwise, flying that night.The policemen of Ohio have spoken often about what they saw on December 14, 1994 - Police cars that inexplicably stalled, light beams engulfing their vehicles, one or more structured craft of a nature never seen before or since.The 1994 sightings of Trumbull County have never been adequately explained by conventional flying objects.(B J Booth)'

1970,' CASEBOOK HOME PAGEIn the very late 1970s, Puerto Rican UFO investigator Jorge Martin came forward with details of an amazing account of the discovery of an Alien corpse. Martin was regarded with high esteem by the UFO community, and his story was subsequently published by Michael Hesemann in Magazin 2000, No. 109, February, 1996. Martin fought hard to unravel the maze of information and disinformation surrounding the events on the island. He spent two years on this case of a lifetime for a UFO investigator.The haunting details of Martin\'s story took place in a mysterious area of Puerto Rico called 'Tetas de Cayey,' or Twin Mountain Peaks. Two young boys were havinga youthful adventure during a night time fishing trip, during which they investigated aseries of caves in the area.  Jose Chino Zaya and his friend were suddenly frightenedto death by the appearance of several small beings who were making one of the caves their temporary home.According to Zaya, one of the small creatures grabbed him by the leg. He quickly picked up a stick and hammered the creature over the head, killing him. Having an elementary knowledge of science, Zaya took the being home, preserving it in formaldehyde. A few days later, he felt compelled to report the incident to the localPolice Department in Las Ochentas, near Salinas.Officer Osvaldo Santiago was assigned to the case. He visited Jose, and examined the strange, unearthly looking being. Jose was beginning to have second thoughts about his decision to bring the dead being home with him, and requested that Santiago take the body with him. Jose admitted that hewas afraid that the other beings would come looking for their dead companion. Santiago could not keep the details from his wife, who in turn, related the strangeevents to a well-known businessman of the area, who requests anonymity. Thisunnamed businessman immediately came to see the alien, and took a number ofphotographs, some of which are show here.The business man soon contacted Professor Calixto Peres, a chemist on thestaff of the University of Puerto Rico for his expert opinion. After a thorough examination of thebeing, he made this statement:'In my opinion it is something extraterrestrial. Its cranium is far too big for the body, which is small and skinny, and itseyes were too big.'Measurements taken of the being showed a length of slightly over 12 inches.Its body was extremely thin, and its skull was almost destroyed from the blow on the head. There is only speculation as where the body is today, andthe mystery of the Puerto Rican being is ongoing until more facts can befound.', 'Strange Craft Appears then Disappears into Thin Air at Springhill Ranch, Late 1970sSpringhill Ranch-Date: Late 70s-Time: afternoon (summer or fall)Location: Springhill Ranch, Telkwa Hi-road, Smithers BC CanadaIt took me many years to try to remember exactly how the craft looked like. I couldn't remember which set of wings were where until I attempted to recreate what I saw that day. For a while I thought the smaller set was in the front. But this looks more like it.Thanks to my good friend Barb for sending me this article.B J I was in the back area of the property looking for my horse to go riding that day. Normally my horse along with the others would have been there but for some reason they were spooked and up in the woods on the hillside. I never clued in that something might be wrong.I was on my way back along the fence towards the house when I just stopped in my tracks. I had this feeling that I should look up and that's when I saw that craft above my head. The air was still. I never heard a sound coming from it. It was just in the air and was not moving. I don't know how long it was up there before I noticed it but after about 30 seconds it just took off into thin air. I had a clear shot of the whole sky in the valley and I tell you it just vanished within a couple of seconds - without a sound.The following is the outlay of the ranch where the encounter occurred. Most of our property was located on a hillside (to the left) which cannot be seen on the following diagram.For days afterwards I drew a stick diagram of the body and how the wings were. I knew there was something odd about those wings facing the wrong way. I never associated it to a UFO for many many years because UFOs were suppose to be flying saucers, or at least that's what I was lead to believe. The first thing I thought, after my mind went blank staring at that thing in awe, was that it was military. Perhaps because it was black, who knows. But it wasn't right and was completely out of place. Not to mention hovering over my head.I also began drawing a strange diagram. I spent days working at it to get it right. The teardrops had to be very very dark with a slight shine to it. The original was very elaborate but I lost it over the years while moving around so much. Today I just attempted to recreate how it generally looked.The whole time a word kept popping into my head as I was working on it. Satus. I just felt it had something to do with this diagram and so I wrote the word with it. I felt so strongly that this diagram was important and that it had meaning. Who knows.It wasn't long after my encounter with the craft that I ended up back in that end of the property again. This time to bury my cat who had suddenly just up and died for no reason. I remember he had blood coming out of his nose. I loved him so much I wanted to bury him near a tree which had a hollow in it. I loved that spot for some reason. Felt special to me. The horses were back there eating grass and hanging out like they do. I laid my cat down in a deep hole I dug and then covered him up. I knew if I didn't protect him the coyotes would get to him so I went to search for some big rocks to cover his burial spot. I found a couple went and laid them near the burial and then went in search of some more. I remember feeling like I was being followed so I stopped and turned around. A young filly was the closest to me, however she was eating grass and looking away so I figured I was imagining things so I continued searching for big rocks. Again I felt like I was being followed. The young filly was even closer but she was eating and ignoring me. I turned back around and continued my search. This time I knew for sure something was behind me. I wheeled around in time to see the filly rear up. She towered over my head. That's when I realised she was going to strike me. I looked down in time otherwise she would have broken my face. Instead she struck the top of my head. I collapsed to the ground thinking she broke my neck. I screamed blue murder. I just knew she would attack me again if I didn't get out of there so I crawled to a windrow nearby.My folks heard the scream back at the house and came running. They thought I was being mauled by a bear. My face and long hair was covered with blood from the gash on top my head. To this day we do not know why the horse attacked me. Our horses were good and had never done that before. And it never happened again. The attack occurred close to where I had seen that strange craft.To this day I have not come across anyone having had a similar sighting. I'm still waiting to hear from anyone who has.source:Posted on Fri 09 Sep 2005 Barb Campbell© 2005 Northwest Saskatchewan UFO Research Center (NWSURC). All Rights Reserved.', 'Tagish Lake-Yukon Territory Canada, UFO photographs, 1970Introduction As a result of some local publicity in May and June of 1998, we were informed that a photograph of several UFOs near Tagish Lake was taken some years back. In July of 1998 an investigation led to the identification of the secondhand witness who was in possession of a slide duplicate of the image. A copy of the slide was made, a preliminary analysis performed, the witness was interviewed and results are presented in this report.  We know that there was a total of seven objects from witness testimony. This is important since object 7 (the smallest object) is almost indistinguishable from bright reflections off the mountain rocks.Sighting Description and Story Background Two couples were doing some recreational boating on Tagish Lake in 1970 (approx.). Tagish Lake is a large glacial lake about 100km(60 miles) south of Whitehorse, the Territory’s capital. The two couples were travelling in two separate boats. To respect their anonymity, we will simply refer to the two men involved in this story by their first names, Jim and George. George was in his early 50’s and Jim was in his mid 60’s around that time. Note: since the writing of this report, Jim\'s surviving daughter has been contacted. She has given her permission to disclose his identity.It was about 10 am when they were travelling southbound on the lake. It was windy and the water was a bit on the rough side. Jim\'s boat was smaller than George\'s and also had an open top. George and his wife where driving in a closed and larger boat. Because Jim had a smaller boat and wanted to stay out of the roughest water, he was travelling close to the shoreline while George and his wife could afford to travel out in the middle of the lake and were about 5 to 8 kilometres back. While travelling along the edge of the lake, Jim and his wife saw seven strange glowing orbs as shown in the photograph (Figure 1). There are four closer objects and three more further up the mountainside. Jim estimated that they were 3 to 4 feet in diameter. They moved about slowly for the estimated 15 minutes that they watched them as he and his wife traveled down the lake. The four closer objects eventually made their way up the mountain to join the other objects. George was too far back to notice the objects and didn’t even have sight of Jim\'s boat. His concentration was devoted to the rough water. Jim or his wife never mentioned anything to George until the film was developed, about a week later. We can speculate that this may have been because of the fear of ridicule or disbelief. That is until Jim had the slide in hand. As far as George knows this was the only photo of the objects that Jim took. Jim used slide film and made a couple of slide duplicates for George . George submitted one to the Weather Office who submitted it the Department of National Defence in Ottawa. About a year later George was curious to find out what the department found from their analysis so he asked the person at the Weather Office to look into it. The answer he got back was that that information was classified. Preliminary Investigation and Analysis The analysis performed here does not come from experience in analyzing UFO photographs but rather from the viewpoint of experience with photography. Further analysis is warranted by experts in the UFO field. On Sept 5, 1998 a field trip was undertaken to establish a more precise location of the sighting and the location of Jim when he took the photo. After some effort the location was found and a 1998 photograph was taken from the same spot using a camera with the same focal length lens as Jim used. The UFO locations were drawn as red circles to facilitate analysis. The island in the forefront enabled us to pinpoint the witness location on a map of the area (105K). It is estimated that the 1998 photo was taken within about 10 metres (30 ft) of the 1970 photo. Unlike the 1970 photo which was taken under cloudy conditions the 1998 photograph was taken in good lighting and therefore shows a lot more detail in the terrain. The photograph was taken at about 9:45am, about the same time of day as the 1970 photo. Because of the higher detail some further analysis could be performed. By measuring rock formations on the island and scaling them on the photograph it was established that Jim was approximately 50 metres (164 ft) from the island. The distance of 250 metres (820 ft) from the island to the shore behind it was scaled off a map. Therefore, the total distance from Jim to the shoreline was approximately 300 metres (984 ft). The 1998 photograph clearly shows that UFO#1 was in front of the tall spruce trees at the shore line. If we assume that UFO#1 is just in front of the trees and therefore 300 metres from Jim, we can calculate its size. After doing the math we get a maximum object diameter of 1.4 metres (4.5 ft). This agrees well with Jim\'s estimate that the objects were about 3 to 4 ft in diameter. Although the objects look like dots in Figure 1, calculations show that UFO#1 would of appeared to be about half the diameter of a full moon to the witnesses. These magnified images can give us the relative diameter and color of the UFOs. The diameter was used to assess object size and distance. The color of the objects also give us some important information. Note that UFOs 1 through 4 (the closest ones to the camera) are not in direct sunlight as the surrounding trees are not illuminated. Therefore, these objects may be glowing by their own source. The glow is of yellow and perhaps of a slightly green color. In contrast, the area around UFOs 5, 6, and 7 up on the mountainside is bathed in morning amber light from the sunrise. The three UFOs also seem to be of a similar amber color suggesting that they may be reflecting sunlight as well. If this is true, it indicates that they are of a solid nature rather than some form of plasma. The questions remains; if the 4 closer objects were exposed to the sunlight, would they also reflect it over and above their glowing yellow color? Did they appear to be of the same amber color to Jim once he observed the 4 closer objects join the other objects further up on the mountainside? Witness Reliability The testimony of the secondhand witness George sounded very sincere. George was curious about what Jim saw and photographed and added that neither him nor Jim have or have had a big interest in the UFO phenomenon. There was no apparent reason for Jim to make up the story or to fake the photograph. Jim’s story which was related by George sounded sincere and the two were close friends. Jim was the Chief Grain Inspector of Canada around that time and therefore it is unlikely he would have risked his credibility by perpetuating a hoax. One question which often comes up is 'Why is there only one photo of the objects when Jim observed them for 15 minutes?' Of course there may have been more photos that we are not aware of but as far as George knows, Jim only had the one image. However, during the September 1998 field trip, one possible explanation for the one photo theory came to mind. As I was holding up the UFO photo in front of me, looking at the scene, and simultaneously trying to steer the outboard motor to get into Jim\'s position, one thing very quickly became apparent. When I imagined what the real scene must of looked like, it almost sent chills down my spine. Although, UFO#1 looks only like a dot in the photograph, UFO#1 would of looked ' DAM CLOSE ! ' in real life. If Jim wanted to at the time he could of driven the boat towards the UFO and been underneath it in less than 30 seconds and taken more photographs at very close range. Surrounded by ice cold water it wouldn’t surprise me if he would have chosen to do just the opposite; that is, take one quick photo and continue to drive down the lake while keeping a somewhat fearful and very watchful eye on the objectsThe prints were scanned using a UMAX 1220S Scanner ranging from 150 to 1200 dpi.

It was New Year\'s Day, 1970, but it was supposed to be a routine morning shift at Cowichan District Hospital. Nurse Doreen Kendall had started her shift at midnight and was due to get off work at 8 a.m. Not much of a way to greet the New Year, but it was her job. Doreen, a practical nurse, worked on the second floor of the hospital at Duncan, on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Doreen lived in Nanaimo and commuted the twenty-six miles to Duncan. At 5 a.m. Doreen and nurse Frieda Wilson began their usual morning rounds in a four-bed ward. While Frieda attended to the patient nearest the door, Doreen checked on the patient in the next bed, nearest the window. As she did every morning, she went to open the drapes in order to let in a little of the early morning sunshine. When she opened the drapes, she was amazed to see something totally unexpected. Outside, about sixty feet away, a flying object was hovering at a height of about sixty feet, even with the third floor of the hospital. The object was saucer-shaped, with a transparent bubble-like dome in the center, and was tilted slightly towards her. Because the object was tilted toward her, Doreen could see inside the transparent dome, where she saw two humanoid figures standing in front of a chrome, dial-covered instrument panel. She estimated the figures to be about six feet tall, wearing dark clothing, and some sort of headgear. There were seats in front of the instrument panel, but the figures were standing rather than seated. Doreen was stunned. The Cowichan area had a reputation as a UFO 'hotspot', but she had never expected to see one herself. As she watched, one of the men noticed her and touched the other, apparently to alert him of the fact that they were being watched. The other man looked up, and then manipulated a control, causing the object to begin to move. At this point Doreen called to Frieda Wilson, who came to the window in time to see the object outside. The two then ran to the nurses station and told three other nurses, who reached the window in time to see the object, although it was some distance away by then. The object circled several times and then vanished to the northeast at high speed. The sighting was never explained. source:www.about.comLoy Lawhorn', 'Morphing Metal Saucers over Yuma, Arizona, 1970DATE: 1970 August-roughly-TIME: 3 am-WEATHER: clear, warm, windless, large full moonlight lit, starry night. SIGHTING LOCATION: YUMA ARIZONA THOUGHT GOING THRU MY MIND... So, this is what 'THEY' look like up close, and I bet nobody has everseen them do this! WITNESSES: 16 people...six adults, 10 young people ranging in ages from 49 to 10. NUMBER_OF_OBJECTS: 2 SHAPE_OF_OBJECTS: inverted 'pie-pan' metal saucers, which morphed into sparkling white orbs, then back intosaucers again. DESCRIPTION: I will skip the details of my brother and my interest in sciencefiction....which led to us sitting in the front cab of our camper motorhome, looking at the stars, as our convoy of relatives made a lengthyrest stop. The night was clear as bell. We were parked by a lone hill, on a rarelyused back road, coming into Yuma Arizona. I say rarely used because, the whole hour we were there, no other carshappened past us. We were on the outskirts of the city, parked in the actual dirt road,beneath a tall telephone pole, on the earlier mentioned lone hill. Justa large bump of dirt really, that had missed getting leveled with therest of the dirt road. I remember the full moon being so bright one could see far into thefield across the road from us. In this same field, left of the drivers side of the camper, about 500ft. away, I noticed a string of blue lights, lying parallel on the ground, and Ithought we might be near an airfield landing strip. The lights were like small dark blue stars, the way a black light bulb looks these days. There were two large oak trees in the vast field of yellow waving drygrass, close to the dirt road, about a 300 ft. away. The grass was notvery tall, just like the dead, sun scorched grasses of any givenfield...about 5 ft. high. I am 5 ft. 7 inches tall, so the grass would be waist high to me, if Iwere out standing in it. I thought the blue lights were a landing strip, because they were thathot electric blue color, and there were about 18-20 of them, equallyspaced apart in the field of dead grass, but there were no buildings, orfarms, or anything for miles all around us, and NO AIRPORT! just the twohuge oak trees, the twin strips of landing lights on the ground, theendless grass, and the black, diamond twinkling silhouette of the YumaArizona city skyline in the far distance. A thought crossed my mind for a quick second. Where was the source ofelectrical power for these lone lights, and who turns them off, and onin an empty field, in the middle of nowhere? To the right hand side, lay the city's brightly lit black skyline. Ithad to have been at least 10 miles away, but as the land was generallyflat, we had a totally unobstructed view of it. Wondering why planeswould want to land in the middle of an empty field, by an oak tree noless, we watched the supposed landing strip to pass the time, hoping tosee an approaching plane coming in for a landing.... We looked away forjust a moment, to ask for a snack plate through the adjoining camperservice window. We hadn't even looked away two minutes, when I noticed, a set of landinglights, one red, two white, and one greenish aqua, coming in low, justover the grass of the field, headed straight towards us! How could I have missed the sound of this approaching flight? I thoughtit was strange, they were airplane lights, but it was flying way toolow, vertical to the horizontal landing light strip, and it was comingin painfully slow...too slow, like it was gliding or crashing? We didn'tno which, so we watched it for about 15 minutes. We wound down thewindow to listen if we could hear a motor in distress or something... Earlier, there had been crickets chirping, and all sorts of fresh nightsounds, now there was nothing, just a deafening roar of silence.. Nonoise from the low flying plane either.. The plane could not have beenone mile away from us, approaching, but it was taking it forever to getto us. Agonizingly slow, so slow it appeared to be standing still, which mighthave been the case! When it finally reached the two oak trees, it flew between them, but notpast them, and began to ascend, slowly, straight up through the lowestbranches, and low and behold, another set of lights, exactly the same,rose up right underneath the first pair! I said, if I didn't know any better, I would have sworn that, thatsecond plane came straight out of the ground, or had been waiting on theground for the first plane's arrival... The spread of the planes' wing-span was the length of maybe a commercialtour plane, or a crop duster, it was not that big, about as wide as 5average cars parked head to tail lengthwise. Strange thing, these planeswere still moving forward painfully SLOW...and flying just over the topof the grass...skimming it actually. When both planes reached the oak tree branches, the upper most oneveered right, seemingly to purposely give the bottom set of lights roomto move up. We then knew we would now get a better view of these two slow planes asthey rose as high as the top leaves of the oak trees they passed, andthey were STILL approaching us. My brother wanted to shine our blindingly bright camper spotlight onthem...but I warned him not to...very unsure why, but I told myself, hemight blind the pilots, but these planes were doing things no pilotedearth planes could do, and maybe the light they might shine back at usmight not be so good. Maybe they were helicopters? We thought this because they rose straight up in the air, and hoveredthere for minutes at a time, then they seemed to play with each other,turning, backing up, gyrating back and forth, like boats rocking on deepwater, and flitting about, just like a humming bird can do. They seemedaware of each other's slightest movement, like they were alive? Plane #1 was now just above the two trees in the field, #2 was justabove the grass, in plain view, but darkly shadowed by the trees' densebranches. They were both still facing us by the position of the landing lights,when plane #1 suddenly descended so quickly and violently atop #2, weknew they would crash together.... and crash they did, and there wasabsolutely NO NOISE. We saw them hit, wobble as if stunned, and just bounce off each other,continuing slowly, both ascending through the tree's thick heavybranches. The branches bent, and gave way around them, but didn't break. There wasNO NOISE of leaves rustling, as this happened, and we were close enoughto have heard that. By now they were just over the treetop's leaves, moving into thebrilliant full moonlight, as they silhouetted against the moon, justabove the telephone pole on the one dirt hill, now, on our right handside, we began screaming. The planes were not planes! They had no wings, no sound, and they were completely circular...Liketwo gigantus pie pans put together! To this day I believe they heard usscream, because up until then, they seemed only interested in eachother, and totally unaware of our presence. They hovered mid-air, after the screams, then began to descend slowly,right on top of us! They were close enough for us to view the full under side of the shipssince they were no higher than the top of the telephone pole...lets see,pole plus hill... They were just about 50 ft. above us, and they gave an appearance ofbeing as light as the air itself by how gently they floated down. Theywere huge solid metal objects reflecting in the moonlight, but theyfloated, and gyrated about like weightless spinning leaves in the warmwindless night, and they were still descending. They were close enough for me to hit them, if I threw a rock, and Ican't throw worth a dime! They were bigger than our camper and they were going to land right ontop of us! All our party heard us screaming, and stuck their heads out the camperdoor, and out their several car doors, and looking up, they startedscreaming too... The saucer shaped circles were nickel colored, dull smooth steel on top with a raised flat darker top, andunderneath an equally protruding flat black circular portioned bottom.No windows, seams, or doors were apparent. The colored landing lights,which had no rays, shone bright head on, but dully, when view fromunderneath! They were low enough now to block out the moonlight, and they were 3xthe size of our camper which was the largest vehicle, holding a familyof seven! OH! They WERE going to land on top of us!!! Suddenly, in the den of ourcommotion, as if becoming aware of our terror, they stopped descending,just stopped in mid-air, whirling like fitted stationary gyroscopes.Flying side by side, the two saucers went up on their sides together,from a horizontal to a vertical position, in perfect synchronization,and now stood in the sky, a stones' throw above us, like two huge pewtersilver wheels.Suddenly an intensely bright light like a 4th of July sparkler startedpushing out the middle of their dark bottom protrusions, while the samething was happening simultaneously on the top protrusion, and all thismet together around the rims length wise in a cohesive whole. They literally transformed from dull flat saucers into huge glowingorbs, right in front of, or right over our heads, about 25 ft. up, orcloser, since I could hit them with a rock if I had had the nerve tothrow one! no sparks dropped, or heat or noise was apparent. no smell ofsmoke or exhausts.This took only a matter of seconds to happen, and the minute thetransformation was complete, both balls of light shot off like white hotmeteors, in the direction of the Yuma city skyline... It took less thana minute for them to reach the city, where they hovered up and down justabove it, looking for all the world like bouncing stars, glitteringblue, then white, then red then green. They flew all along the top of the city, then they started back towardus! Food, supplies, and people flew everywhere. Getting in our perspectivevehicles, and gunning the motors, we went from 0 to 90 in six minutesflat, raising a cloud of dust so thick we could barely see through it! Looking out our windows, and up, we could see the objects were back, andfollowing us from the sky. They were now as high as any commercial plane, and looked like twoplanes from up there, but they were still flying in sync, and turning ona dime up there! They had their row of landing lights back on, and they were saucersagain, but this time the lights were flashing like a real plane woulddo. They followed us (chased?) to the edge of the cities' outskirts where weslowed down, feeling safe enough to park, and watch them veer off, andup, back in the general direction from which we had just come! So yousee, I know UFOs can transform shapes, and saw how they did it... I got the distinct impression they were as curious about us, as we wereas scared of them. They seemed playful, if a machine could have a personality, like onekitten would play with another. I think they thought our camper and cars were worth looking at. until wepopped out of them....like fleas or a virus, I suppose! Just animpression I got! Indulge me! We saw many, many more types after that, a few up very close, but notquite as personal! I continue to watch the skies. I am 52 years old now, and I have had enough UFO experiences to last alifetime. They keep happening though! I believe they still frequent Arizona, and various parts of Mexico, theygot us there too! I have seen them actually disappear right while I was watching, so Iknow they can do that as well. I have to add, I thought they only frequent the rural areas, I waswrong, a couple of good city experiences took care of that! I tell this story to whomever wants to hear it. It never gets dull forme...this was before video cameras, and for some reason I am glad no onethought to use one of our, then, antiquated cameras with a flashbulb. geesh! I will consider writing some more of my UFO experiences soon. I see there is more of an interest now than when I was coming up. I was 19 or 20 when this happened to my family while traveling acrossthe USA from California, to Mississippi.

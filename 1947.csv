1947,'The Roswell UFO Crash (1)Published: January 12, 1991'Roswell,' the very mention of the word brings images of a crashed UFO, aliens, government cover-up, autopsies, hidden debris, guarded charred bodies, and weather balloons. In the history of UFO reports, no case has received the world-wide attention as the Roswell event of 1947. Not only did the alleged crash of a flying saucer create mass coverage at the time of the event, but remains today as an often discussed case by which all other cases are judged. So many books and articles have been written about Roswell, it is not an easy task to write another, but I feel that no UFO enthusiast cannot include it among his comments. The Roswell event is the cornerstone of UFO research. The case offers everything one could imagine; a crash of some flying craft, direct, hands on testimony of witnesses who handled crash debris, government cover-up and secrecy, and most of all a list of participants which is generally listed at around 500 first and secondhand testimonials.Ironically, the alleged crash story originally died as quickly as it began. It would be many years before UFO researchers refueled the fire behind its enormous potential. Most all of us are familiar with the famous Roswell headline stating that the Army had captured a 'flying saucer,' and then the retraction a few hours later, substituting a balloon for the crashed saucer. At the time of the original event, a sense of naivety and trust gave birth to a rapid, quiet acceptance of the retraction, and there the event died. But, fortunately, it was resurrected in 1976, and has kept pace with all other events of the last 50+ years. It would be January 1976, when ufologists William Moore, and Stanton R. Friedman were mulling over some interview notes from two witnesses whom Friedman had met with. A man and a woman, who both had knowledge of a crashed saucer in July 1947 in Corona, New Mexico were the key witnesses. A retired Air Force officer, Major Jesse A. Marcel asserted that he had first hand involvement in the crash debris, and the Air Force cover-up. The woman was Lydia Sleppy, who had been employed at an Albuquerque radio station KOAT. She claimed that the military had covered-up the story of a crashed saucer, and the bodies of 'little men,' who were aboard the craft. She also claimed that the Air Force had literally stopped the sending of a teletype news report of the incident.The USA Military had announced to the world that it had captured a flying saucer on a remote ranch in Corona, and then about four hours later corrected the story, saying that what was found was just a weather balloon with a radar reflector kite. We have two stories. Which one is the truth? Though subsequent confirmations of the balloon theory continue, as long as we have firsthand witnesses who defy this explanation, the investigation must continue. Of all of the explanations given to Project Bluebook, it is quite strange that the Roswell story was never mentioned. The story that died so quickly was rarely mentioned from the beginning, the only one, to my knowledge, was in a mid-1950\'s lecture by UFO enthusiast Frank Edward. It seems that from the beginning, a grass roots group of believers would perpetuate this grandstory. When we solve the puzzle of the many UFO reports, it will be due to this grass roots movement. The truth is hard to kill.It would be June 24, 1947, when the term, 'flying saucer' was coined by pilot Kenneth Arnold. He used this term to describe UFOs flying over Mr. Ranier, and only a couple of weeks later, the phrase was used by the Air Force to explain what had been found in Corona, New Mexico. The alleged crash debris was flown to Eight Army Air Force Headquarters in Ft. Worth, Texas, and somehow between the time that Jesse Marcel Sr. had handled the 'other worldly' material and its arrival in Ft. Worth, the strange material had lost its luster, and became just a weather balloon. The Air Force had effectively murdered the eye witness accounts, and made fools of all who were involved. Marcel would categorically state that the debris he held in his hands, and showed to his family, was not the same material shown in photos of the 'balloon wreckage.'What happened to the saucer debris? An uncertified, but controversial document might provide an answer. Supposedly a brief prepared for then President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower,  this document was authored on November 18, 1952. It asserts that on September 24, 1947, President Harry S. Truman ordered the genesis of the highly top-secret 'Operation Majestic-12,' to study the remains of the Roswell crash.  These papers would arrive in a plain manilla envelope, postmarked Albuquerque, in the post of Los Angeles television producer Jaime Shandera in December 1984. In the early part of 1987, another copy was given to Timothy Good, a British ufologist. Good released it to the British press in May.These documents caused quite a stir, but their authenticity cannot be established beyond doubt. The jury is still out on the MJ-12 papers, but many ufologists view it as a hoax. The issue itself is not insurmountable, however, as a huge amount of evidence still remains to establish the Roswell crash as a reality.The Roswell saga actually began in Silver City, New Mexico on June 25. Dr. R. F. Sensenbaugher, a dentist, reported sighting a saucer-shaped UFO fly over, that was about one-half the size of the full moon. Two days later, in Pope, New Mexico, W. C. Dobbs reported a white, glowing object flying overhead, not too far from the White Sands missile range. On the same day, Captain E. B. Detchmendy reported to his commanding officer that he saw a white, glowing UFO pass over the missile range. Two days later, on June 29, Rocket expert C. J. Zohn and three of his technicians, who were stationed at White Sands, watched a giant silver disc moving northward over the desert. On July 2, a UFO was tracked at three separate installations; Alamogordo, White Sands, and Roswell. In Roswell, on the same day, Mr. and Mrs. Dan Wilmot saw a UFO. They report its appearance as 'two inverted saucers faced mouth to mouth,' moving at a high rate of speed over their house. Enter rancher Mac Brazel.The events of Roswell began on either July 2 or July 4 (there is some disagreement here). A throwback to western days, William W. 'Mac' Brazel, a sheep rancher, would etch his name forever into UFO history, a designation that he neither desired, nor appreciated. A common working man, Brazel was foreman of the Foster Ranch in Lincoln County, near Corona, New Mexico. Brazel was a family man, but his wife and children lived in Tularosa, near Alamogordo. The reason for this arrangement was so his children could attend better schools than they would at Corona. Brazel stayed in an older house on the ranch, where he tended sheep, and the general chores of the ranch. He was a simple man, content with his job, family, and his life. Mac would be thrust into the limelight for a brief period of time, and ultimately regret ever reporting what he was about to discover on the range of the Foster Ranch.An evening thunderstorm was raging at the close of another workday; the storm was highlighted by numerous bolts of lightning. These summer storms were not uncommon for these parts, but this evening Mac noticed something different...  a sound, like an explosion mingled with the typical sounds of a storm. Two of Mac\'s children werestaying with him that night at his farm house. Mac retired with the children, and temporarily forgot about the sounds of that night. The next day\'s sun brought Mac out again to ride the fences, and check on his sheep. He was accompanied that day with a seven-year-old neighbor boy, William D. 'Dee' Proctor, who often rode with Mac. As they rode into the open field, ahead of them they noticed an area about a quarter of a mile long and several hundred feet wide, covered with debris of some type. The debris was composed of small pieces of a shiny, metallic material, a material that Mac had never seen before. The sheep would not cross the fragmented pieces, and they had to be taken the long way around that day. Because of the curious nature of the debris, Mac picked up some of it and carried it back to store in a shed. Little did he know the significance of his find.One of his children, Bessie Brazel recalled: 'There was what appeared to be pieces of heavily waxed paper and a sort of aluminum-like foil. Some of these pieces had something like numbers and lettering on them, but there were no words you were able to make out. Some of the metal-foil pieces had a sort of tape stuck to them, and when these were held to the light they showed what looked like pastel flowers or designs. Even though the stuff looked like tape it could not be peeled off or removed at all.''[The writing looked like numbers mostly, at least I assumed them to be numbers. They were written out like you would write numbers in columns to do an addition problem. But they didn\'t look like the numbers we use at all. What gave me the idea they were numbers, I guess, was the way they were all ranged out in columns.''No, it was definitely not a balloon. We had seen weather balloons quite a lot, both on the ground and in the air. We had even found a couple of Japanese-style balloons that had come down in the area once. We had also picked up a couple of those thin rubber weather balloons with instrument packages. This was nothing like that. I have never seen anything resembling this sort of thing before,- or since...'Later that afternoon, Mac took young Dee Proctor back home, a journey of about 10 miles. He took along a piece of the debris that he had found, and showed it to Dee\'s parents, Floyd, and Loretta. Mac tried to get the Proctors to go back with him, and look at the strange material strewn in the fields.Floyd Proctor would later state: '[He said it wasn\'t paper because he couldn\'t cut it with his knife, and the metal was different from anything he had ever seen. He said the designs looked like the kind of stuff you would find on firecracker wrappers...some sort of figures all done up in pastels, but not writing like we would do it.'Loretta Proctor remembered: 'The piece he brought looked like a kind of tan, light-brown plastic...it was very lightweight, like balsa wood. It wasn\'t a large piece, maybe about four inches long, maybe just larger than a pencil.''We cut on it with a knife and would hold a match on it, and it wouldn\'t burn. We knew it wasn\'t wood. It was smooth like plastic, it didn\'t have real sharp corners, kind of like a dowel stick. Kind of dark tan. It didn\'t have any grain...just smooth.''We should have gone [to look at the debris field, but gas and tires were expensive then. We had our own chores, and it would have been twenty miles.'The first hint that the debris could be 'not of this world' would come the next night from Mac\'s uncle, Hollis Wilson. Mac told Hollis about his find, and Hollis urged Mac to report the findings, since there had been reports of 'flying saucers' in the area as of late. On July 6, Mac was going to Roswell to strike up a deal for a new pickup truck. He took along some of the debris, and stopped off at the Chaves County Sheriff\'s Office and spoke to George Wilcox. The story of the find was not significant to Wilcox until he actually handled a piece of the silvery material. Wilcox telephoned the Roswell Army Air Field, and spoke to one Major Jesse A. Marcel, who was the base intelligence officer. Marcel told the Sheriff he would come into Roswell and talk to Brazel about his find. Word of the goings on began to spread rapidly in the community, and soon Mac was talking to radio station KGFL about the incident. Mac told the station what he knew over the telephone.Marcel and Brazel met at the Sheriff\'s office. Mac told Marcel what he knew, and showed him a piece of debris. Marcel reported the results of his interview to Colonel William H. Blanchard back at Roswell Army Base. A decision was made for Brazel to go out to the site, and investigate for himself. Marcel would take his old Buick, and Army Counter Intelligence Corps officer Sheridan Cavitt accompanied him in a Jeep all-terrain vehicle. Following Marcel back to the ranch, it was too late that day to visit the site, so they all three stayed in Mac\'s ranch house. After a dinner of beans, the three headed to the site the next morning. After a brief look around, Mac left Marcel and Cavitt, returning to his chores.','1947-Portland, Oregon, Flying Saucers Seen; Multiple WitnessesOriginal Title: Saucers made no ordinary fireworks By Phil StanfordThe Portland Tribune, Jul 3, 2006 What I do know, however, because I read about it in the newspapers, is that 59 years ago today, scores of Portlanders, including pilots, police officers, and just plain civilians like you and me, saw – or at least thought they saw – flying saucers above the Rose City.According to no less a source than The Oregonian, the first flying saucers, or whatever they were, were sighted directly over Oaks Amusement Park.Immediately, the police bureau put out an “all cars” alert, which was answered by three patrolmen who said they saw them, too.One of them, Earl Patterson, identified as an “air corps veteran,” said they were traveling fast, “wobbling and weaving,” and in his opinion they were not airplanes.The other two, Walter Lissy and Robert Ellis, both civilian pilots themselves, said what they saw were discs, making sudden changes in direction and traveling at a “terrific speed.”• • •Capt. K.A. Prehn, along with two of his men at Harbor Patrol headquarters on Irving, reported seeing several “discs” pass overhead at a height of 10,000 feet.They were unsure whether there were three or six of them because of confusing flashes from the objects, which “seemed to oscillate, weave and turn until … sometimes only a crescent was visible.”“Captain Prehn described the sight as a ‘wobbling hubcap.’ A regular plane was in the sky at the time,” the news account continued, “but these were not planes, they agreed.”Meanwhile, over at state police headquarters on Southeast McLoughlin, Sgt. Claude Cross reported seeing two objects that looked from a distance like “toy balloons, almost pure white, traveling sideways, with no flashing lights.”• • •But lest you be tempted to take the easy way out – which is, of course, that these mysterious objects were actually top-secret CIA weather balloons – there’s the report from a United Airlines plane en route from Boise to Portland that night.Or as the headline at the top of the first page of the July 5 Oregonian unmincingly put it:“Air Liner Crew Confirms Flying Discs Over State”Shortly after takeoff from Boise, World War II veteran Captain E.J. Smith, plus his co-pilot and a stewardess, spotted nine of them. Upon landing, Smith described them as “bigger than aircraft … very thin, very flat on the bottom and … rough or irregular on the top.”The discs, which were flying at about the same altitude as the plane, followed them for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing.“No object I know of could disappear so quickly,” observed Smith.The Oregonian’s headlines the next day read:“Flying Saucers Everywhere; New Tales Convert Skeptics”They just don’t write headlines like that over there anymore.But then, to be fair, we haven’t had a decent UFO flyby in a long time, either.Contact Phil Stanford by phone at 503-546-5166 or by e-mail at philstanford@portlandtribune.com.

A USO report from MUFOR on the internet as follows:Witnesses: Pawlu Zammit and othersLocation: 20 miles S of MaltaObject: Black submarine, or other type of craft?Sound: NoneNotes: Fishermen on a boat 20 miles south of Malta were raising their nets with a catch of fish when they saw an object floating on the water\'s surface that looked like a black submarine. The fishermen were frightened because they thought it looked more like a monster than a submarine, so they quickly pulled in their nets and started the boat\'s engine. At that moment a bright light from the 'submarine' lit up the whole area and 'little men' began running over the deck of the object. The fishermen couldn\'t make out much detail from their boat but whenever the light illuminated the 'little men,' they could see some sort of apparatus around their waist.When the witness was asked how tall these men were, he replied, 'About the size of a 10 year old boy.' After a few minutes, the 'little men' entered the 'submarine' which began to glow so brightly that the fishermen couldn\'t see the object. It then submerged.

Palmer passed the story onto Kenneth Arnold, who was investigating UFO reports in the Northwest. Arnold interviewed Crisman an his associate Harold Dahl who claimed they were harbour patrolmen (their first lie). Crisman reported that they had seen a doughnut-shaped craft dump piles of slaglike material on the beach of Maury Island in Puget Sound. The next morning a mysterious man in black had threatened Dahl, who claimed the man said \'I know a great deal more about this experience of yours that you will want to believe.\'. The 2 men showed Arnold the material who in turn contacted an Army Air Force intelligence officer, Lieutenant Frank Brown, who flew up from Hamilton Field in California in the company of another Air Force officer. The 2 Air Force officers immediately recognised the material as ordinary aluminium but did not say so in front of Arnold due to the fact that he would feel embarrassed. While flying back to Hamilton, their B-25 caught fire and crashed, killing both officers. Crisman and Dahl later confessed to investigators that they had made up the story. Before his death Crisman changed the Maury Incident story to that of an American Plane dropping radioactive waste instead of a UFO dropping unknown substances. A sceptic association investigated the case, which they date to 21 June 1947,  instead of 31 July 1947 (?), and gives the explanation 'foundry slag, unrelated plane crash.' Note that Ed Ruppelt was involved in the investigation and classifies the event as 'admitted hoax.' sources:http://ufologie.net/indexe.htm', '1947, Pilot Spots Six UFOs over Morristown, New Jersey07-10-1947 USA, New Jersey, Morristown. On the morning of July 10, 1947, Mr. John H. Janssen, editor of the Daily Record (an American aviation journal) was flying his own plane from Morristown Airport in New Jersey.  He spotted six, luminous spherical craft with hazy rings around them flying in a trail high in the sky above him.  He grabbed his camera and shot a picture.  He was only able to get four of the six objects in the image frame. Two weeks later, on July 23rd, he had another encounter of what looked to him like the same or very similar aircraft.  He was again flying his airplane out of Morristown and was at 6,000ft. 'While my eyes played over the horizon, I became aware of a shaft of light that seemed like that of a photographer\'s flash bulb.  It came from aloft, very high up.  It was above that position over my plane\'s nose that flier\'s call  11 O\'clock.  At first I thought it was merely the reflected sun bouncing off the sides of an exceedingly high flying aircraft.  I gave it no more thought.  But then the engine of my own plane began to perform peculiarly.  It coughed and sputtered spasmodically.  So I pulled on the carburetor heat and gave it full throttle hoping to thaw any ice that might be accumulating in the carburetor.  The engine emitted one final wheezing cough and then quit.  Now, the nose of my plane, instead of dropping to a normal glide, remained... rigid... fixed on the horizon, in its normal level flight attitude. Abruptly, I became aware that my plane was now defying the basic law of gravity. I became frightened and close to panic at so weird a predicament. I saw that the airspeed indicator was at zero! There was now an odd prickling, electric-like sensation coursing through my body. I had an eerie feeling that I was being watched and examined by something that minutely studied my features, my clothing, and my airplane... I flicked a cold bead of perspiration from my eye. Then I saw it! Above and slightly beyond my left wing tip was a strange wraith-like craft, one of the flying objects! Its flanged and protecting rim was dotted on either side with steamer-like portholes. It seemed to radiate a dull metallic hue that conveyed an impression of natural strength, and a super-intelligence not of this planet. It was motionless. Perhaps a quarter of a mile away... beyond, and slightly higher, I could see another (similar) object, seemingly fixed in the sky. I assumed that the second strange ship was but waiting for the one nearest me to complete its examination. Then I had the most unaccountable urge to reach up and snap on the magneto switch. I had turned it off when the engine quit. I switched both magnetos to the on position. Slowly the propeller began to turn... then the engine burst into a steady rhythmic roar. The plane nosed up into a stall, dropped off, picked up airspeed and steadied under control,' recalled Mr. Janssen. source: http://www.nicap.dabsol.co.uk/morristown.htm', 'Nine Flying Discs Encountered by B-17-Utah, July 16, 1947The ABC Program relative to UFOs has prompted me to provide details of my sighting of unidentified flying objects. This is the first time I have offered this event to any type of media. I was a member of the United States Air Force at the time that I saw nine flying discs. I dutifully reported my sighting to the Operations Section at Travis Air Force Base as had been directed by the Senior Officer. The pilot of our aircraft was also the officer in charge of the section that I was assigned to at the time. I was the Aircraft Distribution Officer of the Far East Air Materiel Command located in Fuchu, Japan in 1947.I had a project to take B-17 aircraft from the theater to Middletown Air Depot, Pennsylvania to have them modified to be air rescue aircraft. This involves such modification to accommodate a lifeboat attached the bomb bay which could be dropped for rescue at sea. I was assigned to one of these trips to observe the modification process. I became a passenger on the flight of a B-17 from Japan to the Middletown Air Depot. The crew picked up a modified B-17 aircraft (without the life boat) for return to Japan.On that return flight I had positioned myself in the nose of the aircraft. As we approached Promontory Point, Utah at 15:30 hours, 16 July, 1947, I noticed several objects rising from the Salt Flats. At first I thought they were big white birds but they were coming towards our aircraft at such great speed that I became alarmed. However, in just a few moments they veered to the left of our aircraft, but close enough for me to identify them as nine round disks, approximately 40-60 feet in diameter with light blue underbellies.They were in what appeared to be a V formation of three, three, and three. They passed off the left wing of our aircraft in a climbing flight. I immediately made my way to the cockpit to advise the pilot of my sighting. He had not seen them. However, the flight engineer, Technical Sergeant GJH (name withheld), Serial Number AFxxxxxxxx, did see them and confirmed my sighting. We only differed on one thing. T/SGT. H saw them as they were a little lower than our aircraft and he described the top of them as sand colored.I had been in the Philippines Islands and Japan for approximately for 18 months and had not been aware of the UFO excitement in the States at that time. The weather over the sighting area was perfectly clear and there was no way that I could have been mistaken about what I had seen. I talk about this event to my friends and others that want to listen to my experience. Since there is so much reaction to stories of such sightings, I have never gone beyond just telling about the event. Also, I never had any further contact with T/SGT. H since he was assigned to a different organization than mine. I have kept the record of this event in my wallet all these years to make sure that the data was immediately available to me in the event someone wanted names and dates. I also put a copy of the data in my personal strongbox for safe keeping.There is one thing that I regret about this event. I had just purchased a movie camera with a telephoto lens while in the States on this trip, and had it right in front of me at the time, and I did not think enough to take pictures of the sighting. However, on the other hand, the whole thing was over in just a few seconds and had I tried to take movies of it I may have missed the whole show.I thought this might be of interest to your group.ETW COL.

On the way home he was unusually quiet. Finally he said, 'They were too big.' He then told me that 10 years earlier he had been stationed at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, where he was part of a film unit.One day an officer came and told him and another man to grab a couple of 16mm movie cameras and follow him. He took them to a heavily guarded hanger. Inside was a badly damaged circular craft and about an acre of debris placed on a canvas tarp. My father and his friend were instructed to get footage on everything. They did so. They then were taken into a refrigerated unit at the rear of the hanger. Inside the unit was what my father described as a museum case holding the bodies of two small creatures;  gray, thin with large eyes but no eyelids. One showed some severe wounds, the other had no visible injuries. They were instructed to get footage of the creatures. When the case was opened to allow a better shot there was a smell similar to dead fish. When they had finished filming the cameras were confiscated instead of being taken back to the lab for processing. My father said he and his friend were literally sworn to secrecy. My father only spoke of this to me that one time and me promise never to tell anyone. Since he recently passed away I feel I am now at liberty to relate his story. My father was very patriotic and very religious and not prone to making things up. Out of respect for his privacy and mine I submit this report anonymously.

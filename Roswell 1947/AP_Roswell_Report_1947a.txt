ROSWELL, N. M., July 8 (AP)--The Army Air Force here today announced a flying disk [also spelled "disc"] had been found on a ranch near Roswell and is in Army possession.
    Lieut. Warren Haught [sic], public-information officer of the Roswell Army Air Field, announced the find had been made "some time last week" and had been turned over to the air field through cooperation of the sheriff's office.
    "It was inspected at the Roswell Army Air Field and subsequently loaned" by Maj. Jesse A. Marcel [also spelled "Marcell"] of the 509th Bomb Group Intelligence office at Roswell "to higher headquarters."
    The Army gave no other details.
    Haught's statement:
    "The many rumors regarding the flying disk [disc] became a reality yesterday when the intelligence office of the 509th (Atomic) Bomb Group of the 8th Air Force Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disk [disc] through the cooperation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriff's office of Chaves County.
    "The flying object landed on a ranch near Roswell some time last week.  Not having phone facilities, the rancher stored the disk until such time as he was able to contact the sheriff's office, who in turn notified Maj. Jesse A. Marcel of the 509th Bomb Group Intelligence office.
    "Action was immediately taken and the disk [disc] was picked up at the rancher's home.  It was inspected at the Roswell Army Air Field and subsequently loaned by Major Marcel to higher headquarters."
    The rancher's name and location of his place were withheld.
    George Walsh of radio station KSWS, which provided first news of the announcement, said only Major Marcel [Marcell], Col. W. H. Blanchard, commanding officer at Roswell Air Field, and the rancher had seen the object here.
    The sheriff, Walsh reported, upon receiving word from the rancher went immediately to the intelligence officer at Roswell field.

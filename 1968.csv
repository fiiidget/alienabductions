', 'February 28, 1968-Florida, Pilot Takes Evasive Action from UFO At 7:45 p.m., February 28, the three-man crew of an Eastern Air Lines ferry flight from St. Louis to Miami saw a string of unknown lights that caused the pilot 'to take evasive action.' Traveling at 18,000 feet, Captain Robert F. Reilman, Flight Officer A. J. Farmer and Safety Officer Rick Morrison first noticed 'a red flashing light' at their altitude. In his report to NICAP, the pilot said the light was at their 11:30 position about halfway between Jacksonville and Orlando, Florida. 'Who\'s this at our 11:30 position?' Capt. Reilman asked a nearby control center. The center replied that they had been in communication with a plane 15 miles away. 'Well, this guy isn\'t 15 miles away,' the pilot replied. 'He\'s at 11:30, has one flashing red light and three - now four red lights strung out - one red light turned to green.' At this point, Capt. Reilman 'prepared to take evasive action.' The center radioed back that they had spotted no targets on their radar scope. 'Come on,' Reilman responded, 'he\'s going right by us at our 9:00 position.' The center still replied that they had no targets and that no balloons were in the vicinity. 'I dropped the subject and proceeded to Miami,' the Captain concluded. Pacings of ground vehicles have often badly frightened the witnesses, showing that official debunking and denials have not abated fears of UFOs. If anything, they have increased such fears, since many citizens believe the facts are kept from them.source:http://www.nicap.org/newlook/section_III.htm', 'July 8, 1968-Plane Paced by UFO, Warren, Ohio On July 8, the pilot and passengers of a Cessna 172 Skyhawk were approached by a UFO over Warren, Ohio about 10:20 p.m. Two brothers, Richard and Ken Montgomery, with Elizabeth Soverns and Rosalind Rians as passengers, were flying at about 4,000 feet over Warren; Richard Montgomery was at the controls. 'I noticed an object coming toward us from the direction of Youngstown to the southeast,' he related. 'I swung over... to get a closer look when the object headed directly toward our airplane. It stopped and hung motionless in the air... momentarily, and as our aircraft came closer, it moved swiftly upward and came back at us from another angle.' Montgomery said the UFO appeared metallic and had a light beaming from its underside. He estimated it was from six to ten feet in diameter and from 16 to 20 feet tall. The pilot maneuvered the plane several times, but the object kept following at a distance of from 150 to 200 yards. Then the UFO 'suddenly sped in an easterly direction at amazing speed and was quickly out of sight.' During this encounter, control tower operators at Youngstown Municipal Airport received calls from area residents concerning 'a dogfight between two aircraft in the skies over Warren.' source:http://www.nicap.org/newlook/section_III.htm', 'Brigham City, Utah, UFO on Ground, 1968Mrs. L.

In mid-afternoon, Mrs. Cragin saw a shiny object to the west of the city near an area known as the Promontory. Studying it through binoculars, she saw that it was hemispherical in shape (dome-like) with four protrusions like legs on the underside. Mrs. Cragin got in her car and drove toward the object to get a closer look, but when she reached the edge of town the object was gone. Immediately afterwards, she noticed many types of aircraft, presumably from nearby Hill Field, scouring the area. source:http://www.nicap.org/newlook/section_VI.htm', 'The Buff Ledge Abduction7th August 1968-Only seven years after the Betty and Barney Hill abduction, the New England states would again host an alien abduction. Buff Ledge Camp in Vermont would be the site of a visitation by four UFOs which would appear, make revolutionary aerial maneuvers, and alter the lives of at least two young people. Buff Ledge was a girls camp located north of Burlington on Lake Champlain. During their tenure as summer camp employees, Michael Lapp, a sixteen year old maintenance man, and 19 year old water ski instructor Janet Cornell were relaxing at a boat dock on a slack day. On this particular August afternoon, the swim team had a made a trip to Burlington to compete in a meet, and the camp was virtually deserted. Late in the afternoon, the two friends were enjoying the view of the sun setting  over the water, when a bright light appeared in the darkening sky. At first, Michael thought  they were being treated to a beautiful, close up view of the planet Venus. All of a sudden, the glowing light began to move downward, and ever closer to Michael and Janet. The object, at first a round glow, now began to flatten out as it came even closer. Michael shouted, 'Wow! Venus is falling.' As the two steadfastly watched the light, three smaller lights seemed to drop from the larger one, which quickly moved up and disappeared from sight. The three smaller objects began to move over the lake. They were obviously under intelligent control. The objects put on a show for Michael and Janet, doing zigzag maneuvers, loops, and then descended like falling leaves. The three objects now moved even closer to the two baffled teenagers. After forming a triangle, two of the objects pulled back. Michael would later recall a sound 'like a thousand tuning forks' when the two left the third craft alone.The one remaining UFO passed over Michael and Janet, then shot upward and momentarily disappeared. It very soon reappeared, tilted to one side, and dropped into the lake. A couple of minutes seemed to pass before the object reemerged from the water, and began gliding straight toward them! The object was now close enough to see a transparent dome occupied by two childlike creatures. Michael would describe the beings as having elongated necks, big heads, and no hair. Their eyes were also large, and extended around the side of their heads. Michael began to sense a kind of mental communication with the two beings. Watching them intently, Michael slapped his knee, and to his surprise, one of the occupants mimicked his movement. The craft now moved directly overhead, and shot a beam at Michael and Janet. Grabbing Janet\'s shoulder, Michael pulled both of them on their backs on the dock. Suddenly, Michael was overcome with the fear of being kidnapped. He remembers screaming, 'We don\'t want to go!'  The light from the beam was so bright that Michael recalls being able to see the bones in his hand, like an X-ray.  The two teenagers both later related that the beam had a 'liquid' feeling to it, and gave them the sense of free floating.Their next conscious thoughts would be that of staring at the object again from the dock. The sky was now totally black, and Michael wondered how long he had been in this one spot. Looking at Janet, he could see that she was in a trancelike state; drowsy and disoriented. They now heard the welcome sounds of the swim team returning from their meet in Burlington. The UFO now moved upward into the black sky, flashed its light beam repeatedly, and then vanished from sight.  Strangely, Michael and Janet did not discuss what had happened to them, not now, and not for the next couple of weeks, when camp season ended. Maybe the strange things they had seen over the lake this evening were just optical illusions. Maybe they weren\'t. After their summer camp jobs were over, Michael and Janet went their separate ways. During the next five years, Michael rarely thought about that night. But in time, he began to have disturbing dreams...dreams about being kidnapped; abducted...against his will. The dreams would come... like they did... then the dreams would vanish...like they did. It would be ten years after his harrowing experience that Michael made a decision to contact the Center for UFO Studies, and search for answers. Investigator Walter Webb was assigned to the case, and after hearing Michael\'s story, suggested regressive hypnosis to help rid him of his emotional strife and the frightening dreams. During Michael\'s hypnosis, he vividly recalled his experiences on that night in August 1968. He remembered how the beam of light lifted him into the crafts interior; how he entered a bigger craft,  and how he saw Janet lying on a table being examined. The small beings shined a light into her eyes, scraped her skin, and took fluids from her body. 'The aliens all looked alike, Michael recalled, and had those large eyes, a mouth without lips, no ears, and two small openings for a nose.' Michael also described the beings as having three pointed, web-like digits for fingers, and their bodies felt 'damp and clammy.' The aliens related to Michael that their mission was to 'make life like ours... other places.'Janet also underwent the regression, and her descriptions only went to verify Michael\'s. She recalled feeling 'cold' on the examining table, with something 'pulling her hair and pinching her neck.' The abduction of Michael Lapp and Janet Cornell certainly falls within the general pattern of abductions reported by many others. To confirm the facts of their fantastic story, Webb located several other members of the camp who had witnessed the strange lights over Lake Champlain the very night of the abduction! Two other employees reported a similar experience which had occurred earlier that same summer, when they observed unidentified flying objects hovering over the lake for about twenty minutes. Although Michael and Janet\'s experience was not reported for ten years after the fact, it is still a well documented case of alien abduction.author, B. J.

Some lights in the field back of the house, apparently about 200 feet away, attracted their attention and they went to the window to see what was going on. To their astonishment, they saw a dome-shaped object hovering about 10 feet off the ground. The underside of the object was illuminated, and the light covered an area about 20 feet in diameter on the ground. Since they were in a fairly isolated area with no telephone (they had just moved into the house), the couple became frightened. They could hear a buzzing sound, like a transformer, coming from the object. The time was about 2:30 a.m. Mr. and Mrs. John Meloney of the New Hampshire NICAP Subcommittee investigated the report in close cooperation with the Claremont police. In their interview with the couple, they learned that the UFO had remained over the field until about 4:30 a.m. Then the humming became very loud, the light grew to high intensity and the UFO moved away at a low angle upward to the west and disappeared. In the garage, the family dog whined loudly as the UFO departed. Two separate groups of witnesses have been located by the Subcommittee. The reports seem to indicate beyond a reasonable doubt that something unexplained was in the area. source:http://www.nicap.org/newlook/section_VI.htm', '1968, Claremont, New Hampshire-Dome-Shaped Object Hovers 10 ft above GroundLake Erie, USA 1988:Events from the Lake Erie, March 4, 1988 in the USA.Sheila and Henry Baker were driving home with their three children about 8:35 p.m., after going out to dinner. As they neared the waterfront, Sheila noticed something hovering over the lake and they drove down to the beach to investigate and got out of the car. The moon was bright and there was ice on the lake; Sheila could hear it cracking like claps of thunder. Plainly visible was a huge, gunmetal gray football-shaped object that was rocking back and forth, blinding white light emanating from both ends, but it was silent. Then the object began moving, swinging one end toward the shore and descending. The Bakers became frightened, ran back to their car and fled. When they got home, the object was still visible from a window that faced the lake. The object moved out over the ice and continued to descend, with red and blue lights now flashing in sequence along its lower edge. Sheila then called the Eastlake police to report a UFO, and was finally referred to the Coast Guard. Suddenly 5 or 6 bright yellow triangular objects shot out of the center of the large object and began darting around independently. Once they stopped and hovered, point up, around the parent object, then sped away to the north, turned east, then inland toward the Perry nuclear power plant. At this point Sheila called the Coast Guard, which sent a team to their house to investigate. Seaman James Power and Petty Officer John Knaub arrived towing a Boston Whaler, a seaworthy boat. When Sheila pointed to the main craft and some of the triangular objects still zipping around it, the men drove closer to the lake to investigate, accompanied by the Bakers. At the lakefront they could hear the ice rumbling and roaring. In their incident report later sent by teletype to the Coast Guard headquarters in Detroit, Michigan, the men were quoted as saying that 'the ice was cracking and moving abnormal amounts as the object came closer to it.' Power and Knaub gave a running report to their base via the two-way radio in their Chevy Suburban on what they were seeing. The window was down, and the Bakers overheard them saying words to the effect, 'Be advised the object appears to be landing on the lake... There are other objects moving around it. Be advised these smaller objects are going at high rates of speed. There are no engine noises and they are very, very low.' One of the triangles zoomed straight toward the Coast Guard vehicle, a blur of light, then veered east, straight up, and came down beside the parent object. Two witnesses in separate locations also reported seeing the triangles. Suddenly the triangles returned and one by one entered the side of the parent object as it seemed to land on the ice. The ellipse flashed a series of red, blue, and yellow lights, the light emanating from the end of the object turned from white to red, and the triangles re-emerged and hovered above it. The noise from the ice abruptly ceased, and the lights and triangles disappeared.

Should be at our one o\'clock position three miles now'  The pilot said, 'We have nothing on our airborne radar and I\'m in some pretty thick haze now and unable to see out that way.'  At 0358, the pilot then requested an instrument guided approach, and received instructions. The pilot called, and then the transmitter went dead, but they could hear instructions from the ground. The controller asked them to squawk ident,' which meant to use the aircraft\'s transponder which would paint the controller\'s radar with a large, glowing blip with the aircraft\'s identification.  At 0400, the controller then radioed, 'JAG 31 if you hear me squawk ident...JAG 31 ident observed. Cleared for the approach attempt. Contact on frequency 271 decimal three and you\'re cleared for the low approach. They continued to have radio problems for another couple of minutes.  At 0402, they were able to communicate easily. The pilot said, 'Our UFO was off to our left side when we started penetration.  'Roger, understand you did see something on your left side.' 'We had a radar return at about a mile and a quarter, at nine o\'clock position for about the time we left 200 to 14...'They discussed the troubles with the transmission and then, the controller asked, 'Affirmative. I was wondering how far out did you see that UFO?'  'He was about one and a half miles off our left wing at 35 miles when we started in and stayed with us \'til about 10.'  'I wonder if that could have been your radio troubles?'  'I don\'t know.... But that\'s exactly when they started. 'At 0413, Jag 31 are you observing any more UFOs? Negative on radar. We can\'t see anything visually.  JAG 31, request you have someone report to base ops after you land.  What we have, then, was a group of sightings made by men on the ground, at the missile sites scattered around the base. There was radar sightings from ground and weather\'s radar. There were visual sightings from the crew of the B-52, and an airborne radar sighting where the target traveled at 3,000 miles per hour.  Scope photographs were taken. There were sightings made by S.Sgt. Bond the FSC at Nov. Flight, S.Sgt. Smith at Oscar-1, Julelt, and Mike Flight Team and a number of men in widely scattered locations.  The object landed at location AA-43 and the entire observation lasted for 45 minutes. Fourteen other people in separate locations also reported the UFO. Security alarm were activated for both the outer and inner ring at the missile sites. When the guards arrived at the outer door it was open and the combination lock on the inner door had been moved.  Editors Note: The case in my estimation was never investigated properly. Project Blue Book personnel never sent a representative and the case was essentially written off despite the interest of several Strategic Air Command generals including 15th Air Force\'s Major General Nichols.  The sighting was officially explained by on November 13, by Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla who wrote, 'The following conclusions have been reached after a thorough study of the data submitted to Foreign Technology Division. The ground visual sightings appear to be of the star Sirius and the B-52, which was flying in the area.  The B-52 radar contact and the temporary loss of the UHF transmission could be attributed to a plasma similar to ball lightning. The air visual from the B-52 could be the star Vega, which was on the horizon at the time, or it could be a light on the ground, or possibly a plasma. No further investigation by the Foreign Technology Division is contemplated.  This is a classic Blue Book case where dozens of Air Force personnel who see B-52s and stars nightly have their testimony doubted. They know when they\'ve seen a UFO. In this case the scientists doing the Condon report agreed that this was a real UFO.  The apparent damage to the missile site and disruption of B-52 radio transmissions was in my opinion a threat to primary nuclear offensive systems and should not have been trivialized. The records speak for themselves. This article was taken from Scientific Ufology written by Captain Kevin D. Randle USAFR.  I consider this his finest book and recommend its reading. This case like thousands of others are explained away with any simple mundane explanation that can be found. Yet many cases involve the tampering of key government weapon systems.  It appears Quintanilla either did not care or had instructions to write off most of the sightings with any available excuse. I wonder why the reports were white washed, while the Air Force\'s scientific advisor Alan Hynek was coming to the opposite conclusion that, UFOs were real? source:Captain Kevin Randle book 'Scientific Ufology' ', 'Salisbury, Massachusetts-Spring, 1968-Trees Damaged by UFOI got a case from a phone call. They seemed to be frightened by a loud noise about 3 AM in April of 1968. When they went out after the noise they noticed that 2 trees had been stripped downward of all its branches and the tree was scarred of all its bark on the inside. All the other trees were ok. I asked them if they touched anything, the answer was 'NO'.  So I put on my  leather gloves and put the pieces of bark and strips of wood in a cloth bag and sealed it. I took pictures of the area and the trees and the surrounding area. Some of the branches that did not break were hanging downward. Four trees were involved. They formed a diamond shaped area much like a baseball field bases,  or 2 Vs facing each other. The branches that were on the ground were scarred from heat and looked burnt although none had a burnt smell to them. They smelled a lot like sulfur!I took the samples and put them in a box and sent them to APRO.  Along with the samples, pictures, and the statements from the people about the noise and time of hearing the damage (3 AM)  The funny thing was and is to this day in my mind, How did it disappear?  APRO got the samples and thanked me for the event report. One thing APRO asked me, the people whose back yard tees were destroyed from ABOVE and down and I still wonder to this day. Where and how did the object go?There was nothing indicating ANYTHING WENT UP! There was no rocks, no hard substance or any hard object that could cause ALL FOUR TREES to lose its branches upward or downward!!!! Yet the ground and the tree branches smelled like sulfur! From what APRO told me at the time there was every indication  that the branches from all four trees were hit with the same object and at a downward angle. When they received the package,  the grass, the fauna and the branches had a strong sulfur smell to them. The source of the trees being affected 'UNIDENTIFIED.'  The ground area, dropped and flora of the ground was burnt with the same object and smell was consistent with the branches from the trees and the leaves and grasses and ferns on the ground...The pictures confirmed the object came down ward and then disappeared when it hit the ground,  yet no holes or residue from the object that caused a lot of damage.

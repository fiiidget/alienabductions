1987,' Abduction on North Canol Road, Northern Canada  1987 Kevin\'s Account written, Feb 2001 posted March 21, 2004) In August or September 1987 (later determined to be Wednesday September 2, 1987), I left Ross River (where I lived) and headed up the North Canol Road by myself on my motor bike for moose (hunting). I was planning on spending 3 days in the area between Sheldon Lake and Macpass. A guy I worked with and a friend of his were to leave a day later and I was to meet them for some fishing. We were all to stay at a trailer at Dewhurst Creek. I left Ross River early in the morning and the temperature started to drop. Then it started to rain very hard and very cold. When I got to Gravel Creek, I stopped at Art John\'s Cabin and put on extra clothes while standing under the edge of his roof. I knew the rain would not stop, so I got back on my bike and headed off. I arrived at the trailer ½ hour before dark, very cold and very tired. I lit up a fire, cooked supper and went straight to bed looking forward to the morning hunt. Over night the rain had stopped. At daybreak (September 3, 1987) I put my gear and my gun on my bike and headed towards Macpass. A couple of miles down the road, I was putting along at about 10 mph looking into the trees and watching the hillsides. I decided to stop for a restroom break. I stopped where I could see some mountainsides and some valleys. I parked on the right side of the road. The sun was shining; the air was perfectly still and a bit cool. I was standing just in front of my bike watching the mountains to the south, when I noticed to the left out of the corner of my eye, what I first thought was an airplane. It was 400 to 500 yards away and about the size of a DC-3 plane or a full-size school bus. It was travelling north to south, at about 40 yards above ground and moving maybe 30 km/h. Right away I thought 'boy is he low'. I blinked my eyes because I couldn\'t make out any tail fin or wings. It had what looked like portholes all along the side of it. It was cigar shaped with a grey strip down the middle and a dark green on top and bottom. I thought to myself, 'something\'s wrong with this picture', then I realised there was no sound! If it was an airplane, the roar would have filled the valley. As I watched, it seemed to partially dematerialize and then return to solid form, it did this as it was moving, a couple of times. Then it dawned on me, oh, oh, I don\'t think I should be seeing this; it\'s a UFO and probably doesn\'t want to be seen! I crouched down on the road, hiding behind the roadside grass. I then watched it go behind a cone-shaped hill and not come out. I stood up looking for it and feeling very excited and happy about what I saw and thinking they didn\'t even know they were being watched. I was standing beside my bike when I heard a loud metallic clunk behind me around the corner. Right away I thought, somebody must be here and I\'ve got to tell them what I saw. The noise I heard sounded like a heavy trunk lid on a car slamming shut. I quickly walked along the edge of the road to the corner to see who was there. I came face to face (about 20 yards) with 2 grey creatures in blue jump suits, about 5 ft. tall with big insect looking heads, pointy faces, big eyes, thin arms, body and legs. I immediately thought 'they\'re not little green men*, they\'re grasshopper people'. At that same instant, the one on the left raised his left hand to his waist, which held some type of flashlight device and I saw a bright flash of light come from it. I instantly felt paralyzed and was convinced time had stopped, everything was black, no sound. I tried to yell 'No!' but all that came out was a distorted grunt. Next thing I knew I was standing on the side of the road scared, shaking and confused. Within seconds I remembered all of this that had just taken place and I thought, 'I\'m getting out of here before they get me again.' I turned around to get my bike and for some reason it was not there, then I noticed it was on the other side of the road. I said to myself, 'what the hell is this? I didn\'t put it there'. Still panicking I rushed over and got on it and realized the keys were gone. I always left the keys in it, that way I could not lose them while sneaking around in the bush. I immediately started looking down the road and suddenly saw them in my hand. I started my bike and raced back to the trailer. I was feeling scared and amazed at the same time and then noticed that all the shadows of the trees were pointing in a different direction than that of the morning sun. About 15 minutes later I was at the trailer. Half an hour later it was dark. I thought 'no way, I only left here an hour ago, what\'s going on?' I was really confused then, I said to myself, 'I\'m not telling anybody about this, I\'ll just forget the whole thing'. I put on a pot of coffee and could then hear a soft humming sound above the trailer. I could also feel a soft vibration in everything (trailer, air, etc.). After about 10 minutes it had all stopped. I had a very strong feeling that they were outside. I did not look out the windows. Later that night I still couldn\'t sleep and while having my coffee I began to have flashbacks of the past events. I remember being in a dream-like state watching scenery flash by underneath as if I was flying. I watched mountains and rivers and forests go by at a very high rate of speed. I then became aware of other sounds and seemed to wake up. I opened my eyes and could see nothing but black, very deep and inky black. As I was looking at this, the blackness pulled back, revealing a face, I had been looking into the eyes of a grey type creature. I could hear in my mind a voice saying 'there is nothing to worry about'. I could hear him talking in my mind. There were 3 or 4 of these types walking around, but only one talked to me. The two I saw earlier on the road, I never saw again. (Note: the aliens that he saw at this point were of the typical 'grey type' while the ones at the edge of the road were more insectoid.) I then sat up and had an idea of what might be going on and I asked, 'Are you going to do experiments on me?' and the one said, 'They\'ve already been done.' I felt really good then because, except for a strange sensation in my hands everything felt normal. I kept rubbing my hands together but did not look at them, as there was a totally strange environment to look at instead. I experienced no discomfort. The being nearest me asked if I would like to see my home planet and I said sure. I then walked over to the window, where there was a machine that looked like a big copy machine. He asked me not to touch it, I replied 'Don\'t worry, I\'m not touching anything in here'. He then said, that bright white star is your home. I didn\'t know anything about astronomy at the time, but I always thought earth was blue, so right away I thought he\'s lying. He also explained to me about space and stars etc. but I can\'t remember any of it now. I was also asked if I would like to go on a trip. I replied 'Not yet', I felt very honoured to be asked and I did want to go, but felt that the time was not right. Then I was told I would have to forget all of this. I was disappointed at hearing this. The first part of the experience was very scary, but once I was with them, I found them to be friendly, helpful and their looks didn\'t bother me. They actually seemed like old friends. They gave me a clear glass, ¾ full with a yellow liquid and said to drink it up, it would make me forget everything. I told them, I did not want to forget an experience like this. It should be remembered! I was told it was for my own good that I forget. So I took 3 little sips and put the glass down. Next thing I know, I\'m on the road by my bike, scared to death and wanting to get out of there. The next day I met up with the other two guys and never said anything to them.', '1987 - Alaska - Two UFO/Plane EncountersPublished: 4:12 PM 4/5/2010Alaska - Two UFO/Plane EncountersOn January 30, 1987, a US Air Force KC-135 was flying from Elmendorf AFB in Anchorage, Alaska, to Eielson AFB near Fairbanks.The crew of the KC-135 reported a large, silent, disc-shaped UFO at about 20,000 feet altitude. At this time, Anchorage radar control showed nothing unusual.In a moment, radar control asked the pilot of the plane if they still had the unknown object in sight. The frightened pilot replied yes, and added that the UFO was only 40 feet from the plane.The cockpit recording referenced the JAL - 1628 incident,  which had occurred only a month earlier.About 1/2 hour later, Anchorage Control Tower relayed a message from the FAA, informing the pilot to contact them upon landing. The FAA wanted a full report on the UFO seen by the crew.The very next day, on January 31, another similar sighting would occur over Alaskan skies. Alaska Airline\'s Flight 53 reported enormous, disc-like objects.These UFOs, according to the pilot\'s report, were 'tracking' Flight 53. The Control Tower operator related to the pilot that they did not show anything unusual on their radar.The pilot of Flight 53 was very concerned, stating that the UFO was moving at a mile/per/second, which would be about 3,600 m/p/h.The pilot also stated that the UFO had almost immediately disappeared after flying under Flight 53.Neither of the two encounters were adequately explained by any conventional flying objects, or atmospheric anomalies, and remain a mystery.', ' Corydon, Indiana Video Film, August 23, 1987COMMENTS, INTERROGATING FI An official at Evansville-Regional Airport Control Tower was contacted on 24 August 1987. He was unable to shed any light on the object\'s cause or source. To his knowledge there is no known navigation light such as the orange lights being observed. However, an orange light could be produced by headlights at a distance as a result of air pollution, provided the object/headlights are approaching the witnesses. The absence of a green forward position light is suspect and the red position light should have been on the craft\'s 'left wing'. When the object was heading East, the steady red light was in the lead, which is not consistent with FAA regulations. There was an absence of a steady rear white position light. There is a possibility that the red light was not attached, but it 'appears' to fly in a fixed position. That position changed several times, however, indicating some rotation.I personally observed this object from the very beginning. Its color, intensity and movements made it very suspect as a 'normal source'. Immediately eliminating any 'natural source' I also find it difficult to place in a 'manmade source' category, unless proper FAA lighting was not adhered to. This activity was observed near an airport and a moderately-sized city (Louisville, KY) where position lights and a see-and-be-seen situation is more of a life & death situation than other areas. There were no flashing red or white beacons or anti-collision lights at all, no belly strobes, and no steady white rear position light. There was no red light in a left wing position. If the 'aircraft' were heading toward us and gliding to our left at the same time, the red should have been on the right or west side of the object. If going away from us, the red to the left would have been OK, except that the headlight (if that\'s what the orange light was} would have been pointing away from us. This was not a refueling operation. Not only do these not take place in areas close to airports, they are conducted at high-altitude, and the lights used are brilliant white. This was probably not any kind of helicopter for the same reasons mentioned previously. Mandatory position and anti -collision lights were absent. Position lights should be easy to see and the red one was very dim in comparison. If the object was further than we thought (the red light being so small that it could be seen only with binoculars), then the bright orange light was not only a dangerous distraction but much larger than it appeared. The actual 'apparent diameter' of the orange verses the red appears to be about 6-to-1 on the observed video segment. However, the ratio could be much higher. The volume or intensity was about 200-to-l. The image on the videotape appears to be flatter than just. a ball of light. Because of the resolution of the camera it also does not show any color, but merely looks whitish. The red light appears duller, but the red does not appear. This resolution problem is not unusual for such a small target. MUFON Form 8, Photographic Evidence, was completed and submitted by the camcorder operator and State-Section Director/FIT Scott Wilkerson. Preliminary data provided indicates the object was 'filmed' at 6x magnification on the zoom mode. We believe that the normal mode would have not resolved the red object. It is our opinion that the object is unidentified. NATURAL SOURCES have been completely ruled out. Of the MANMADE SOURCES, Balloons, Fixed Structures, Hoax, Missiles, Satellites were immediately ruled out. This leaves the remote possibility of aircraft, of course, but as witnesses (8 MUFON people, 5 qualified observers) and for reasons specified in the report, we are not convinced that this was any type of aircraft. Absent was the damning anomalistic motion or the over flight with total absence of sound. If the aircraft and the unidentified object were at approximately the same distance, the object would have been traveling at about half the speed of the aircraft, which may have been under stall speed.FINAL REPORT BY FI/STATE DIRECTORAugust 13, 1990The long-awaited computer analysis recently conducted by our new scientist/member David Cook, was received on August 4th, 1990, and is now part of this report. The object is considered unidentified, borderline significance. source:Francis Ridge, State Director, Field Investigator, MUFON Indianahttp://www.nicap.org/870823dir.htm', 'The Ilkley Moor Alien 1987One of the most unique accounts of alien abduction comes to us from the Ilkley Moor in Yorkshire, England. The witness and subject of this case is a former policeman named Philip Spencer. Spencer claims that in the early morning of December 1, 1987, he was taken aboard an unidentified flying craft, and after his release managed to snap a picture of one of the alien beings.The Ilkley Moor is very much as you would picture it. Reminiscent of the setting of the moors of Baskerville Hall in Conan Doyle\'s 'Hound of the Baskervilles,' it is an eerie place. It has been said that 'The Ilkley Moor can scare you to death during daylight, and at night it\'s even worse.'It is a place of mystery. There is the Swastika stone; boulders etched with strange markings; the Badger Stone; and the Twelve Apostles stone circle.Many times the only living creatures on the moor are the sheep. Ilkley has other legends too, like the hovering lights at night, which bring occasional reports of UFOs. There are strange, swirling lights that are filtered through the fog and seem to have a mind of their own. Possibly some of the mysterious sights can be attributed to the not too distant Menwith Hill Military Base, or the nearby Leeds Bradford Airport.The activities of these two facilities will not, however, explain what happened to Spencer. There were also stories of strange creatures that roam across the moor at times.After four years of being a policeman in another city, Spencer had moved his wife and child to the Yorkshire area to be closer to her family. He was walking across the moor on this December morning heading for his father-in-law\'s house and on the way was hoping to get some photographs of the strange light tricks of the moor. To be able to get the images he desired he was using a high ASA rated film to compensate for the poor light in the area.Unfortunately, the picture that he took was somewhat blurred, but there is no doubt that the creature in the photo is a one of a kind being which basically resembled the small grays.Along with his camera, Spencer also took a compass to navigate through the fog before sufficient daylight shone through the moor. As he was searching for some photo angles, suddenly he caught the sight of a strange looking being in the slopes ahead of him. He aimed and snapped a picture of the creature which seemed to be gesturing for him to stay away.It then ran away. Spencer gathered his wits and took off in pursuit of the being. Today he says he doesn\'t know why. It was just an impulse reaction. He arrived just in time to get a glimpse of a flying craft with a domed top rise up from the moor and disappear into the sky. Atop the dome was a whitish square. He was not able to get a photograph of the object.Ilkley Moor Original Photo There was silence now. When he saw nothing else of the being or its craft, he began to walk to the nearest village. This walk took about 30 minutes, and during this time, a couple of things became apparent to him. First of all, his compass now pointed south instead of north, and secondly, the village clock showed the time an hour ahead of his...Spencer was confused now. Did he see what he thought he saw?To answer this burning question, he headed by bus to the nearest town with instant film development. Sure enough, he had a picture of the creature! It looked to be about 4 foot tall, and had a blue-green tint to its skin. He knew he had something of importance, or at least, he thought he did. He found the proper channels to contact UFO investigator Peter Hough.Hough knew what he was hearing was a 'too good to be true' case, and it worried him, but after meeting Spencer, he was convinced that he was a man of integrity and was not seeking fame or fortune for his picture. There was no reason to not believe what Spencer had told him. Hough began a thorough investigation. The film with the alien picture would be the first thing to undergo professional scrutiny.The alien picture was first looked at by a wildlife photography expert. The object in the image was not an animal of any known kind. It could not be determined either way if the figure was animate or static. A reconstruction of the original site did establish the alien\'s height at or near 4 and one half feet.The photograph was next sent to Kodak laboratories in Hemel, Hempstead. An analysis showed that the object was indeed part of the original photo, and not superimposed. This conclusion did not, of course, determine what the creature was.Next, the picture was sent to the United States for computer enhancement and analysis. Dr. Bruce Maccabee, optical physicist with the United States Navy rendered his expert opinion;He stated that the slow film speed used for the low light conditions made the film too grainy for proper testing. 'I had great hopes that this case would prove definitive. Sadly circumstances prevent it from being so,' Maccabee stated.Something strange was noticed in the picture. Appearing on the hill at exactly the spot where Spencer says the UFO was is a white square. Could it be that he had gotten a part of the UFO in the shot unknowingly? He was not sure.The final outcome of the investigation of the alien picture? There is not a way to prove hoax. There is also no way to prove that the strange creature on the moor is alien. I must state here that opinion on the authenticity of the picture is pretty much split among interested parties. Some UFO enthusiasts are hopeful that more evidence will emerge to substantiate the claims of Philip Spencer. There are those who do not believe that the figure is alien. Why?... since there is not definitive proof either way.? Because they don\'t want to.The picture taken of the creature was in color, and what is mostly available on the net is a cropped, black and white photo. We have a scanned copy of the large color photo and a large version of the black and white film. See them both HERE.Hough\'s next step in his investigation was to look at Spencer\'s compass. There was no doubt that it would have had to be subjected to a strong magnetic field to alter its direction from north to south. Hough discovered that a magnetic resonance scanner would duplicate the effect.There was also the fact that there was no way to prove that the reversed polarity of the compass was accomplished at the alleged scene of the event.To perpetuate a hoax, Spencer may have affected the magnetic change before going into the moor. Hough was not done yet. He utilized a University to do radiation tests at the scene. No radiation was found. He also had Spencer tested by a psychologist. In his opinion, Spencer was telling the truth, as he knew it.Spencer had begun to have strange dreams of starry skies, and was still puzzled by the missing time he experienced, so the final test would be subjecting him to regressive hypnosis. The session was conducted by Dr. Jim Singleton, at Arthur Tomlinson\'s home, on March 16, 1988. Also there were Peter Hough, and Mathew Hill, a journalist friend of Hough who was to operate the three tape recorders.Here is a transcript of the session:JS- I want you to cast your mind back to the 1st December last year when you set off across the moor. I want you to clear your mind back to that and I want you to re-experience that. I want you to tell me what you experienced.Spencer- I\'m walking along the moor, oh! its quite windy. There is a lot of clouds. Walking up towards some trees. I see this little something, can\'t tell, but he\'s green it\'s moving up towards me. (We later found out that Jon had took the photo after his abduction and the creature was waving goodbye) Oh! I\'m stuck I can\'t move and the creature still coming towards me. I\'m stuck and everything gone fuzzy. I\'m, I\'m floating along in the air I want to get down! (He later told us he was levitated 2 feet off the ground and the creature was in front of him like a child pulling a balloon on a string). I still can\'t get down and I don\'t like it. I\'m going round this corner and this green thing is in front of me. Oh God! I want to get down! (long pause) (breathing faster) There\'s a there is a big silver saucer thing there\'s a door in it. And I don\'t want to go in there. (worried sound in his voice) (sigh) Everything gone black now. (pause).JS- you say everything gone black?Spencer- Mmm! I can\'t see anything like I\'m asleep, can\'t hear anything. (short pause) There\'s a bright light now. Can\'t see where it\'s coming from? I\'m in a funny sort of room I can hear this voice saying don\'t be afraid. I don\'t feel afraid anymore. I can still see this green thing but I\'m not afraid anymore of it. I\'m being put on a table. I can move now if I want to, but I don\'t feel frightened any more and there\'s a beam like a pole it\'s above me it\'s moving up toward me. It\'s got a light in it like a fluorescent tube. It\'s coming up from my feet I can hear that voice again saying 'we don\'t mean to harm you and don\'t be afraid.' Makes me feel warm as it moves up me it\'s coming up over my stomach towards my head. Close my eyes I don\'t want to look at it in case it hurts my eyes. It\'s gone! (pause) there is something my nose feels funny (shows movement of nose) that\'s gone as well, I\'m standing up now I don\'t know how I got stood up? I can see a door there is one of these green creatures motioning for me to come with him. Don\'t really want to go with him. I\'d rather stay here I don\'t feel afraid in here (pause).JS- Can you tell me what\'s happening now?Spencer- I\'m walking towards a door there is still a bright light there is light all around want to know where its coming from its just bright all around. Walking down a corridor there is a window. Oh! God!(sounds shocked)is that real? (deep sigh) (pause) (sounds afraid) don\'t want to be up here want to be down there? I can hear that voice again saying you\'ve got nothing to fear. Its pretty though didn\'t realize it looked so pretty. (What Jon was looking at through the window was the earth seen from high in space just like the Apollo astronauts saw. Iv gone past the window now I\'m walking down a corridor. (long pause)JS- What\'s happening now?Spencer- Come to the end of the corridor. There\'s a hole opened in it so I can walk through. I\'m in a big room-a big round room, I\'m on a raised platform against the wall. My camera and compass are trying to get away from me. Going towards the ball. It\'s difficult to pull them back down again, and this balls moved round with strange its got some blocks on it he says we cant stay in here to long he wants us to go out again the holes closed in the wall its gone strange he says I\'ve got nothing to fear but Id still like to go home (pause) its got such big hands.JS- What\'s happening now?Spencer- Going down a corridor again. its very bright still I wish I knew where the light was coming from. And there is another door, going through a door it\'s an empty room two of those green creatures have come with me. there\'s a picture ,it\'s starting to move on the wall wonder how they get the pictures?JS- Can you tell me what\'s happening at this point?Spencer- I\'m looking at the pictures on the wall. (long pause)JS- Pictures on the wall?Spencer- Mmmm. Creatures seem concerned at the damage that its doing. Picture changing now there\'s another picture, another film he\'s asking me a question he says do you understand? I said yes. It\'s time to go. Everything gone black. I\'m walking up the moor again, I\'m walking near some trees. Some movement - I can see something. A green creature. I\'ve shouted to it. It\'s turned round. I don\'t know what it is. I\'ll photograph it it\'s turned around now. It\'s moving quick want to know what it is. I\'m running after it, it\'s gone round a corner, I can\'t see it now. There\'s ... There is a saucer (laughingly), big silver saucer! It\'s disappeared? I\'m walking on down gone past the trees.JS- What\'s happening now?Spencer- I\'m going home. It\'s ten o\'clock on the town hall clock. Can\'t really understand it was only eight o\'clock.JS- You mentioned some green creatures. Would you try to describe them to me?Spencer- It\'s quite small. He\'s got big pointed ears, it\'s got big eyes. They\'re quite dark, he hasn\'t got a nose he\'s only got a little mouth. And his hands are enormous. And his arms are long. He\'s got funny feet.JS- Funny feet?Spencer- They\'re like a V shape like two big toes. Must be difficult to walk like that. He shuffles rather than walks. I don\'t feel afraid of him although he looks odd.JS- You mentioned big hands? Can you say anymore about the hands?Spencer- It\'s got three big fingers, like sausages. Big sausages. They\'re just very big. Bigger than my hands.JS- About how tall would you say these creatures are?Spencer- It\'s about four foot. Comes to the lump on my stomach. He\'s about as high as - just a bit bigger than my stomach is.JS- Okay. Now I wonder if I can ask you another question? you mentioned a film?Spencer- There were two films.JS- Two films?Spencer- One was lots of scenes of destruction like on the news. Can see lots of waste going into the river, and people like Ethiopians who are starving. It\'s not very good, it\'s not very nice.JS- Want to say anything more about that film?Spencer- It\'s much of the same thing, only different.JS- What about the other film then? Do you want to tell me about it?Spencer- I\'m not supposed to.JS- I\'ll leave that up to you entirely, do you want to say anything about that?Spencer- I\'m not supposed to tell anyone about the other film, it\'s not for them to know.JS- Is there any thing more?Spencer- No.As Spencer regained his missing memories, he gave us a fascinating tale of alien abduction. He was taken aboard the craft that he had seen lifting up from the Ilkley Moor. He was given medical-type examinations before being released. He could now remember that it was after his release from the UFO that he took the picture. This one fact would be extremely important:Hough had dealt with a lingering problem with the picture, the time element. Climatic information gathered about the conditions of December 1, 1987, made it almost impossible for Spencer to have taken his picture at the time he had stated. However, and this is extremely important, if the regressive memories are accurate, the conditions would be right to duplicate the lighting conditions of the photograph, which was taken at least an hour after Spencer thought.The witness of a UFO/alien event is as important as the report itself. The case of Ilkley Moor rides high on the character of Spencer. Through the years, Spencer and Hough became good friends, and still see each other from time to time. There has been no change in Spencer\'s account of what he saw that day.He has sought no money from the case, and signed over all copyright privileges to Hough in early 1988. Spencer desires no fame from his account. Is the picture of the Ilkley Moor alien real? There is no way to say. It could be some type of mannequin or doll staged for the photograph, or it could be the picture of the century. Time will be the judge. Until that time, the search for more information continues.author: B. J. Booth', '1987: Abduction of Jason AndrewsOn A hot, sticky July afternoon in 1987 Jason Andrews is celebrating his fourth birthday at his family's cottage near Slade,  Green in Kent when the heavens open. As the thunder crashes all around, there is a single flash of lightning. Suddenly; a stream of numbers starts pouring out of Jason's mouth: fantastic numbers, complex mathematical equations, even algebra - all from a boy who struggles to count to ten. Seconds later the windows and doors begin to shake violently and the four-year-old announces to his mother, father and elder brother: 'They're waiting for me. I have to go.' Jason's father; Paul, grabs his son and stops him from walking out into the downpour, but the boy struggles violently, and as he does so the house shakes to its very foundations -until, finally, he seems to wake from a trance and the shaking stops. It is the first sign that Jason Andrews is no ordinary little boy and, in the eight years that follow, that is dramatically confirmed. 'It wasn't until 1995, when he was almost 12, that Jason told his astonished parents exactly what had been happening to him - aliens had been abducting him from his bed at night. 'It's always the light that comes first,' he confessed to his mother; Ann. 'Then I see the tall one rise up at the foot of the bed. 'Suddenly there's lots of little ones everywhere. They're fuzzy and indistinct, and they move very fast. I can't move or speak, but I'm awake and I can see and hear and feel. I want to scream and run, but the sound doesn't come out and my body doesn't move. 'I hate them. I hate them,' the boy sobbed. 'I have to go with them. 'They take me to an operating theatre, like at the hospital. It's all white and shiny. Sometimes it's a circular room with a metal floor. It's always cold. 'They're there. The big one touches me but I don't feel it, like as if I've had an anaesthetic.' Then he added poignantly: 'But you don't believe me, you just think I'm making it all up.' In fact, Ann did believe him, and went on to explore the phenomena affecting her son's life in a book, Abducted. This decent, uncomplicated wife and mother came to the conclusion that we may not be alone.Source & References:http://www.fortunecity.com/emachines/e11/86/ufo.html'

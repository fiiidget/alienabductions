1957,'1957 Lake Isabella UFO Photograph Still a MysteryI decided to research if someone could possibly take a photo of something that was invisible to the naked eye. I discovered that our eyes only see a very small amount of the infrared, or ultra-violet radiation around us. Only about one octave of the available vibrations (wavelengths) is registered by our normal consciousness. Film is much more sensitive to the other more subtle energies on our environment. Judging by the colors around the \'57 UFO it is mostly vibrating in the infrared range. Another possible theory is that a field of rotating energy surrounding the craft absorbs photons from bouncing back and registering on the observer\'s eye. Those are some of the logical explanations, and yet, as illogical as it sounds I have seen UFOs become invisible on more than one occasion during the day and night - both in and out of the city with and without witnesses. Now you see it... now UFO don’t!Dr. Elmer Green is a physicist who worked just northeast of Lake Isabella for the Naval Ordinance Test Center, at China Dry Lake, from 1947 to 1957. He frequently heard about encounters with UFOs that would fly into range of their observation cameras.  Many times while range testing new weapons systems, good quality films were made of UFOs. He personally saw black and white still shots of UFOs that were taken by other scientists in his work group. While telling his story to scientist and author Richard Thompson, Dr. Green claimed that he knew of some 40 to 50 professional people who had some connection with UFO sightings during weapons testing at China Lake.Dr. Green had even experienced a clear UFO sighting with the base\'s photographic officer, Jack Clemente while watching an AJ Bomber coming in for a landing. According to Dr. Green, 'As the airplane flew over, we saw an object about 16 feet in diameter flying about 400 feet below the bomber. The object seemed to be a structured, mechanical craft. It had a semi-circular forward section that was amber colored. In the blink of an eye, the UFO flipped up to the wing of the plane. It remained there, pacing the plane for a few seconds and then it flew away at great speed vanishing from sight in 2 or 3 seconds.'Dr. Green noticed that even though UFOs looked mechanical, they often seemed to perform beyond the laws of physics. Even though they could move faster than the speed of sound, they did not produce a sonic boom. Dr. Green compared these maneuvers to a spotlight projected on the wall and he considered that they might be real physical structures that were somehow being projected into our space-time. Dr. Green also noted that during his early years at China Lake in 1947, many UFOs were sighted and that he would also regularly see the flashes from atomic bomb air bursts at the Nevada test site nearby. Some of Dr. Green\'s co-workers even speculated that there might be a connection between all the UFO activity and the frequent atomic testing.After showing the ‘57 UFO photo to a senior U.S. space engineer who has helped design many of our latest and greatest spacecraft including the Space Shuttle, I was given the following explanation: Ambient interstellar light saturates our atmosphere and becomes polarized to our earth\'s relative north/south rotation. This angle of rotation is given a relative 90 degree value which can be considered a phase that is unique to all other phases - such as a note on a scale of musical vibrations. As a UFO enters our atmosphere, its relative 90-degree north/south rotation will occasionally align with our Earth\'s polarity phase in harmony. During these brief moments of energy alignment UFOs become visible as bright lights or shiny metallic surfaces. This particular UFO is standing on edge, with its polarized energy field 90û out of phase from our Earth\'s own polarized energy field.When Life Magazine decided not to publish this authenticated UFO photo, my father left the original slide sitting unprotected in the desk drawer of his office which had a leak in the skylight. Over the years, mold grew on the film, but fortunately the original image of the UFO has remained intact. Even though this picture is very old it still tells the story of the future - the implications of which are enormous. I believe sometime in the future, the beings that operate these cosmic craft will reveal themselves and awaken all those who are still sleep waking through life.

The “Wardle incident” has become a classic in the UFO literature, but what really happened in this picturesque Lancashire village back in 1957? Dr DAVID CLARKE found some clues in recently released British Government files.It began at 10 o’clock on the clear, frosty night of 15 February 1957 and 19-year-old Gwynneth Fitton was walking home along an unlit country lane near Wardle, high on the Pennine Moors. Suddenly, her attention was drawn to a bright light moving between two hills near the cottage where she lived with her parents. As she watched it moved towards her and she could see the object was circular with a dome. Suspended below it was a light which switched from white to red at intervals. “The Thing,” stopped dead at rooftop height and Gwynneth ran to alert her mother, Dorothy, who on seeing the object cried out: “Good God, They’re here!” As both women watched it hovered silently and then disappeared swiftly across the moors.Shortly afterwards the Rochdale Observer published the story, playing up the fright the Fittons had received and asked: “Was Wardle Visited by a Flying Saucer?” More witnesses then came forward to admit they saw the same weird object in the sky. “None of the witnesses were believers in ‘flying saucers’ before,” wrote junior reporter Alan Fitzsimmons, “but after seeing such a strange sight their disbelief has been badly shaken.”While this was a fairly typical flying saucer sighting, it swiftly became the centre of a national controversy that led all the way to the Government. For when the local MP, Tony Leavey, heard about the sighting he raised it in Parliament, demanding to know if the Air Ministry had been “releasing objects which are normally described as flying saucers.” In reply the minister said the object seen at Wardle “did not emanate from outer space, but from a laundry in Rochdale.” It was, he said, two small balloons lit by a flashlight bulb that had been released by a mechanic, Neil Robinson, as part of an experiment to build a small radio-controlled airship. Mr Robinson, a 35-year-old radio ham, contacted the police after reading about the Fitton’s sighting in the local newspaper. He confessed that he had used hydrogen to fill two five-penny balloons which he had released on four separate occasions in remote locations. “It was just an experiment in tracing air currents,” he said. But he added the only light carried by the contraption came from a small bulb powered by a pen-torch battery.This confession did not satisfy the Rochdale Observer which claimed Robinson could not explain how he made the hydrogen used to inflate the balloons. The paper obtained a similar balloon and found that even when inflated its maximum diameter was a mere 12 inches. The paper also could not believe that such a tiny light attached to a balloon could have appeared as a glow brighter than a car’s headlamp to witnesses scattered around the town. And the mystery increased when debris was discovered on the moors near Wardle. One of the finds was a silver cylinder that appeared to be part of a transmitter from an Air Ministry weather balloon. Then two boys playing on the moors found other materials including aluminium rods, wire mesh and a parachute whose description sounds like the debris from Roswell! This development made the local paper even more suspicious and it stated: “The transmitter was found nearly two weeks after the sighting of the ‘saucer’, during which time there have been considerable snowfalls, yet the cylinder is perfectly dry and unmarked…” Further fuel was added to the fire when it reported how a “commercial-type aircraft” had flown low over Wardle “flashing unusually large coloured lights” the very night before parts of the balloon were discovered. The implication was the debris found on the moors had been delivered planted by the authorities as part of a cover up – but a cover-up of what? Not satisfied with the answer he had been given in the Commons, the local MP wrote to the ministry demanding a full investigation. In April 1957, an “Air Ministry special investigator with much experience in this field” was sent to make inquiries. According to formerly secret papers, he was an intelligence officer from DDI (Tech), the Air Ministry branch responsible for UFOs. Although the visit was said to have taken place under “the cloak of secrecy” it was widely reported by the Press. The officer quizzed five witnesses who were all “told to keep his visit quiet.” He also paid a visit to Neil Robinson and studied weather records, checking the prevailing wind at the time of the sighting, before he returned to London to write a lengthy report. In May the Air Minister wrote back to the MP saying that he had studied the officer’s report “and I am bound to say that on the evidence I agree with his conclusion which is that, in all likelihood, the objects seen were Mr Robinson’s balloons.” He added: “I appreciate that Mrs Fitton, who had the best sight of the phenomenon, does not share this opinion and I respect her view; but I feel that the probability – and probability is, of course more often than not, all we can achieve in these matters – is that the explanation we have given is the right one.”But there was more. Two decades later the Observer reporter who had covered the original story revealed how his dogged questioning had annoyed the authorities so much that his paper had received a personal visit from the Ministry. Many claims have been made about newspapers being ordered to discontinue their reporting on UFO incidents but few of these anecdotes have stood up to scrutiny. But according to Alan Fitzsimmons his reporting on the Wardle incident “came to an end when the very top man from the Ministry of Defence called at our office personally, took us into a private back room and read the Official Secrets Act to us with the warning to discontinue reporting further on that strange occurrence.” This warning convinced him even more “that there was something very strange about the whole affair.” Even stranger, he described the visitors to the Observer office as two men dressed in dark suits and bowler hats – the Men in Black!How accurate were these claims? Since the First World War the British Government has used a system known as D-Notices to advise editors that certain information, relating to subjects like nuclear weapons and Special Forces, should not be published. But D-Notices have no legal standing and are advisory only. Direct action to stop a newspaper publishing material subject to the Official Secrets Act is rare and would require authorisation at the highest level, a move that would leave a paper trail. Even at the height of the Cold War, such a move would be very risky indeed as news of the “silencing” could easily become a bigger story than the information it was meant to suppress. It is more than a little curious that in 1992, after Fitzsimmons made these claims, former work colleagues said they had “no recollection” of the use of the OSA against their newspaper in 1957.Another more fundamental discrepancy relates to the newspaper’s dismissal of Neil Robinson’s confession. Fitzsimmons said of him: “How I remember that laundryman! I asked him how he had filled the balloons with hydrogen and he was unable to explain, although he admitted it was not possible with the equipment he had. His story was untrue – and so were other hoax claims investigated at that time.”But friends and relatives of Robinson, who died in 1999, paint an altogether different picture. A cousin, Geoff Butterworth, remembers an exceptionally clever man, skilled in electronics, who had served in the RAF during the war. Robinson had much technical know-how and was certainly capable of launching a balloon with lights attached. During the 50s he had pioneered an infrared alarm system and was forever tinkering – Last of the Summer Wine-style- with inventions in the garage at his home near Rochdale. What’s more, Robinson was fond of practical jokes and was fascinated by films about alien invasions, such as H.G. Well’s War of the Worlds. As a child in the 50s, Geoff recalled hearing the commotion that followed the appearance of ‘The Thing’ at Wardle and the rumour that Robinson had “let off a flying saucer.” “I don’t think it was two five penny balloons and a torch bulb,” Geoff explained. He believes ‘The Thing’ was actually an Air Ministry weather balloon that he had obtained for use in his experiments to develop a model airship. This explanation fits the known facts, particularly the finds made on the Wardle moors after the sighting. “Neil Robinson was an astute, imaginative, showy and able guy and the perfect man to build a flying saucer at the height of talk about little green men,” Geoff told me. According to Ivan Corlett, Neil Robinson hatched the plot with his father, Granville, whilst working at the laundry. “It was done out of pure devilment,” he explained. “I remember going out as a child in the back of a big Ford van with this ‘Thing’ in the back and was told to stay inside. It wasn’t an ordinary balloon like it said in the papers, that was a red herring. It was something else. I do know they sent it up over the moors and caused all sorts of bother. It was definitely all a hoax and I remember father coming home a bit panicky because the police got involved and came to round to our house to take statements.”So while for years many people in Rochdale and across the world remained unconvinced by the “official explanation” the Air Ministry had no doubts. The “Wardle apparition” appears in a list of explained UFO reports prepared by DDI (Tech) in 1957 under the heading: “private experiments (Wardle incident).” And a senior MoD official who worked on the case at the time provides us with the final word:“The case shed vivid light on the ability (or otherwise) of people to observe unfamiliar things objectively. Given the specificity of time and place, there can be no serious question but that what they all saw was just the balloons; yet people whose good sense and faith we had no reason to doubt insisted nevertheless on the accuracy of what their imaginations had conjured up.”Source & References:Copyright 2005 David Clarkehttp://www.uk-ufo.org/condign/secfilwardle1.htm originally published in Fortean Times 196 (2005)http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/196_wardle1.shtml', 'The AftermathEditor\'s Note: I would like to thank Mr. Fogl for sharing his amazing story with us at the UFO Casebook. I hope all of you read his account of the taking of two photographs of a flying disc from the S. S. Ramsay in 1957. He had, at one time, because of false information being spread about his photographs, decided to deem them as a hoax, but now, he wants the truth to be known.UFO Snapped from ShipFlying Saucer Review Vol. 5 #1 Jan/Feb 1959RADIO OFFICER T. FOGL, of Harleyford Road, London, S.E.11, gave FLYING SAUCER REVIEW a graphic account of UFO sightings while at sea. The two striking photographs shown here are reproduced with his permission. One is an enlargement of the other.'In 1955, stated Mr. Fogl, I was on a Panamanian ship Eagle. Its call sign HOOF. Perhaps some of my colleagues will remember me, especially on the British Guiana Coast. I would like though to go back a little to 1954. About then I read a book 'Flying Saucers Have Landed,' lent me by a fellow radio officer. I became interested in UFOs, but had an idea that it was all a hoax. I soon changed my mind about that!We had been on the way to Philadelphia from Rotterdam. It was November 25, 1955. At about noon we heard an ear-splitting noise and whistle, followed by a thunderous roar. It all lasted a few seconds. Everything on board shook from vibrations caused by the noise. When we rushed on deck, there was nothing to be seen.At that time on the bridge were the Master, Chief Officer and 2nd Officer, preparing to take O.R. and noon position. They saw nothing pass over the ship. There was just the roar. Nothing else.Well, I had left it at that and forgot all about the matter until three days later, the 28th, I recall. It was nearly 5 PM, and time for our tea. I sat in my radio room reading some magazines when the 3rd Officer came in and asked if I would like to see a neat formation of jets. I ran with him to the wheelhouse and then on the bridge. At first I could see nothing unusual about the 'planes'. Then it struck me.They were not moving! At the same time one 'plane' climbed steeply, yet the rest did not change their position. They just hung there. I grabbed my binoculars to have a better look. Sure enough, there, high... very high, were four huge discs. I could hardly believe my own eyes. But they were there all right. They must have been gigantic. We estimated them to be about 40,000 ft. high, and over 25 miles away from us. But I am not sure.The sky was clear and, only here and there tiny clouds. The sun was near setting and the horizon red and gold. In the sun\'s rays, the objects seemed to give out red vapour trails, but that could have been sun reflection. The discs were flat and black. They were surrounded by a haze, the same as if heated metal in cold weather will have circulating round it in waves of heat. As I watched the discs something strange happened. One disc completely vanished from my eyes and reappeared in another place. By that time, the Captain, Chief Officer, 3rd Officer, and I were all very excited. When I finally managed to get the binoculars back, I was just in time to catch final glimpses of the disc.The moment I got on watch I called S.S. Falcon and asked the radio officer if he had seen anything funny. He said, no-but did I hear an xxx urgency to all ships. In turn I said, no. The copy of the message:xxx CQ VCJ (Urgency all ships from Valentia Radio)'Following intercepted from Valentia Radio VCJ at 23.42 GMT addressed urgency xxx = Begins = Following received from British ship Franconia GBRQ at 23.30Z Begins = At 23.OO Hrs Z, s.s. Olympic Light/ELGU at about 21.45Hrs, in position 36° .04'N, 31° .55'W - a luminous object rose resembling big shooting star, followed by a luminous tail about 20 times the main body. Appeared 20° above the horizon bearing 8Master -That message was from the previous day, the 27th, said Mr. Fogl. It was now 1957, when I was this time on the British ship S.S. Ramsay, we were on our way from Vancouver to Port Elizabeth, via Panama. We had passed San Pedro and the U.S. Navy ships patrolling and having exercises. It was about 2.30 PM, when I was in my cabin doing my laundry. Suddenly the 2nd Officer called me to see a disc! Without being told twice, I grabbed my Yashica C reflex camera from my wardrobe and dashed on the side of the bridge. Sure enough, there was a queer looking object hovering in the distance. It was suitable for a shot so I waited. In the meantime, I tried to keep under control my shaking knees and hands, and watched the disc.It made no noise and was not more than a mile away. It was silver and black. There was no smoke or any gases coming from it. However, under the disc, a red light pulsated. We thought it tried to signal, so the 2nd Officer grabbed the Aldis and flicked back, but there was no response. At last the disc came down near enough and I got one shot. Then it turned and I shot again.The disc was rather thick, and had a flat dome. There were no ports. However, there were some black marks, and I wonder if they were not some sort of exhausts. Then we noticed a ladder! Whether it really was a ladder I can\'t say. It could be some depression in the craft.The object moved very slowly and stayed with us for a few minutes. Then it shot with quick acceleration towards a rugged mountain, and the desert coast of sun-baked California. I would like also to mention that Vancouver Broadcasting Station announced that some strange objects and lights had been seen by hundreds of people. If I am not mistaken this happened in the first days of December.The AftermathBy Graham Conway - September 1, 2001Thad Fogl had his film developed in Durban and found that indeed he had captured two very good pictures of the strange aerial object. The majority of the ship\'s crew members requesting copies for themselves. On returning to England, he contacted either the Daily Mail or Daily Express newspaper, (he can\'t recall which), who in turn replied that they had no comment to make.His next step was getting in touch with Brinsley le Poer Trench, who at that time was editor of Britain\'s Flying Saucer Review Magazine. Much to Thad\'s surprise, he received a phone call from this gentleman the following day announcing that he had some good news. It was to be told that Mr. Trench 'knew' that the craft was from Venus, how many crew members it carried, and in what manner its propulsion system worked!This announcement did nothing to impress Mr. Fogl: on the contrary it merely served to anger him to the point that he arranged to meet with this 'fountain of knowledge.' When face to face, Thad bluntly told Mr. Trench that he was dismayed that he was prepared to disseminate such outrageous lies to a gullible public, that there indeed were serious people who believed in such things as he had witnessed and photographed.Finally adding he thought him pompous, they parted company on less than friendly terms. By this time, The London Illustrated News and Life magazine had somehow obtained copies of his photographs. Publishing them resulted in a deluge of publicity attention that overwhelmed Thad. Finally, on receipt of a letter from a young boy in the United States who had enclosed a dollar seeking a copy of the photo saying that was 'all he had,' Mr. Fogl said to himself 'ENOUGH.' Without further ado, he contacted Gordon Creighton (present editor of FSR) and admitted to fabricating the picture and story. In essence, anything but truthful, but at least it got the 'monkey off his back.'By this time, Thad had left his seafaring days behind him and was working for Hawker Siddley, on rocket propulsion systems. For this type of work he had to be vetted by M15 (Britain\'s Intelligence Service) on a very regular basis. Consequently, admitting to and chatting about flying saucers was not likely to bolster his credibility in anyone\'s eyes, least of all theirs!So, from then on, he simply clammed up. At this point, forty years have passed and Thad felt that he should accept his wife\'s suggestion and go public again, and set the record straight once and for all.Therefore, it was my good fortune to be permitted to interview him in July 2001, at his home here in British Columbia. Mr. Fogl readily agreed to my request to record the interview, which lasted about forty-five minutes. He was at ease, and readily answered my questions, also providing details of his two ocean sightings in a sequential manner. Additional questioning revealed that he had not experienced any further paranormal events in his life. Acquiescing agreeably to my desire to take photographs, we concluded what was for me a very interesting meeting.permanent link: http://www.ufocasebook.com/2008c/tfogl.htmlsource & references:Submitted to UFO Casebook by T.

', 'The Levelland, Texas Landings - 1957One of the most baffling and most publicized cases of a close encounter of the second kind occurred in 1957 at Levelland, Texas. Actually, there were no less than eight well-documented reports of the same craft, and seven more that were unverified; the seven called in by anonymous persons. Some of those who made their reports have kept their names secret. Sadly, this is the case in many UFO reports. Many of those who had thought they were doing the right thing have regretted their decisions later because of public ridicule. However, the Levelland case has many respectable witnesses who have come forward, especially several members of the Levelland Police Department who witnessed the fantastic sights of November, 2, 1957 in the town of about 10,000. To understand the full impact of this case, a chronological account is preferred.11:00 P.M... Only one hour after the Russian Government launched their second dog-carrying satellite, and before America was aware of it, an unusual set of events began in the small town of Levelland. Patrolman A. J. Fowler was on desk duty when he received the first of fifteen different frantic phone calls in what would be an unforgettable night for him and his fellow officers. About four miles west of Levelland, Pedro Saucedo and his friend Joe Salaz were driving in Pedro\'s pickup truck when they saw a brightly lighted, cigar-shaped object moving in their direction. As the object approached, Pedro\'s car engine began to sputter, and his headlights went out. Finally, the car rolled to a stop. Later, a terrified Saucedo would sign a statement which indicated that the object was about 200 foot long. Calling Fowler from the small town of Whiteface, his call was dismissed by Fowler, who thought that the two men had been drinking.11:45 P.M... Fowler receives a second call from a man identified only as Mr. W. The man was driving near the town of Whitharral, about four miles east of Levelland, when he came upon a brilliantly lit egg-shaped object, actually sitting on the pavement in the middle of the road. Mr. W\'s car engine stopped, and his headlights failed. Frightened, he left his vehicle, and after a brief period of time, the object silently lifted up to about 200 ft. and disappeared. His car started back up, and he sped away to make his phone call to Fowler.12:00 A.M... Fowler receives a third call, this time from a man who was traveling 11 miles north of Levelland, when he spotted an unusual flying craft landed on the road. His car also faltered, and he sat watching the silent object for a brief period of time, until it rose up and disappeared into the night. Again, after the craft left the area, his car started, he left the scene, and called the Police station.12:10 A.M... A nineteen year old freshman from Texas Tech University, Newell Wright, was driving 9 miles east of Levelland, when his car engine began to cut out, and his lights falter. After stopping his car and checking for some loose wire under the hood, he suddenly noticed a vivid object sitting on the pavement ahead of him. He described the object as about 125 foot long, and a bluish-green in color. Frightened, he tried to start his car again to no avail. He sat in his car; hoping that another car would come by. None did. After a little while, the object silently rose and faded away into the sky. Afraid to make a report, the young student waited to tell his parents when they arrived home from a trip. They encouraged him to report what he had seen. He made a statement at the Sheriff\'s office, and his report was included in the US Air Force\'s Project Blue Book.12:15 A.M... Officer Fowler receives another call. This time from a man in a phone booth near Whitharral, who, as he was driving 9 miles north of Levelland, encountered an object of some kind sitting in the middle of the road. He had the same mechanical problems as the other motorists, and after the craft took off, his engine started again. At this point, Fowler\'s curiosity and concern motivated him to call the other patrol cars in the area, and report what he had heard from the different travelers. Later, he would state that 'something odd' was going on. In a matter of a few minutes, two different Officers radioed in that they had seen two different flying objects with extremely bright lights, but had not yet encountered any engine problems.12:45 A.M... A man driving west of Levelland very close to the spot of Saucedo\'s initial sighting, sees a large orange ball approaching in his direction. The man testifies that this unknown craft softly lands on the road about 1/4 mile away. The motorist also related a very interesting fact. He stated that the craft, orange at first, became a bluish-green color upon landing on the road. He also noticed that the craft spanned the width of the road. After the craft landed, his engine also failed, and he sat in the cab of his truck, which was lit up by the glow from the craft. After a time, the craft lifted up and left the area. This man did not make a report at the time of the sighting, but did file a report the next day.1:15 A.M... Fowler receives a call from a truck driver from Waco, Texas, who states that while driving northeast of Levelland, he witnessed a large, glowing object, and at the same time, his truck engine failed. Fowler noted that the caller was extremely frightened. The driver added that the object was about 200 ft. long, and after it left the area, his truck roared back to life, and he 'got the hell out of there.'1:30 A.M... Fowler receives the first definite sighting of the object by two law enforcement officers. Sheriff Clem and Deputy McCullough, who were receiving constant updates from Fowler, had observed a 'large, glowing object,' pass across the highway. The two officers were trying to track the object by the radio calls from Fowler. They were about 4-5 miles outside of Levelland when they saw the object. The two officers stated that the object looked like a large, red sun and it lit up the entire highway as it passed over.The events of the night finally came to an end.  Fowler would later state that he had received no less than fifteen calls from observers who claimed to have seen the unusual craft. He also said that they were legitimately excited, and some of them extremely frightened. The unusual number of witnesses to the Levelland events only solidified the theory that some unusual craft had been in the area of the city for at least 2 1/2 hours that night. The dramatic accounts of the landings on the road set this case off as one of the most convincing cases of an encounter with the unknown. The next day the small town of Levelland, Texas was bulging over with reporters, anxiously awaiting some official explanation for the events of the night before. The Air Force did investigate these sightings, but offered no reasonable cause for what was seen that night, save for an electric storm. The case is still considered 'unexplained.'Listen to short audio file of CBS radio coverage of  Levelland, Texas, LandingsB J Booth', 'Old-Saybrook, Connecticut, December 16, 1957 (UFO with Occupants) A reported sighting of a UFO with occupants seen through its windows, having a number of similarities to both the Squyres and the Knight cases, occurred in Connecticut, five years later, on December 16, 1957. It was investigated by Richard Hall, former Assistant Director of NICAP and currently NICAP\'s Research Consultant, and Isabel Davis, currently of the NICAP staff. Mrs. Mary M. Starr, a resident of Old Saybrook and a former teacher with a Master\'s Degree from Yale, told the NICAP investigators that she had been alone in her home on the night of December 15. 'I went to bed early,' she said, 'about 10:00 o\'clock. Some time between two and three in the morning, I was awakened by a bright light in my room. I looked out the window and there was what I first thought was a crippled airplane in my back garden. But when I got my eyes really open, I saw that it was a cigar-shaped object, brightly lit and with square portholes, hovering just above my clothesline. I could see men inside. . .' The object, no more than ten feet from the north side of Mrs. Starr\'s home, was approximately 20 to 30 feet long and dark grey or black in color. It hovered motionless about five feet above the ground, between the house and the tool shed. She saw no wings, fins, or other appendages. Through its lighted windows Mrs. Starr saw two figures that passed each other, walking in opposite directions. 'I could see that it [the object was so shallow that the men could not have been more than three and a half or four feet tall,' she told the investigators. The occupants\' right arms were raised but no hands were visible. They wore a kind of jacket that 'flared out' at the base, and their heads were unusual - square or rectangular, red-orange in color, and with a brighter red 'bulb' in the center. She thought they might possibly be wearing some kind of helmets. The lower portions of their bodies were below Mrs. Starr\'s sightlines. She saw nothing else in the object, such as chairs or instruments. A third being came into view from the left. As Mrs. Starr leaned forward to see more clearly, the portholes faded and the entire shell of the object began glowing brightly (compare with Mrs. Knight\'s report). From the top end closest to the witness there arose a kind of six-inch 'antenna' that oscillated and sparkled. After five minutes of glowing steadily, the antenna was retracted and the craft began to move. It retraced its original path, gliding smoothly in the direction from which it had apparently arrived. It then made a very sharp right-angle turn, appearing oval in shape. The hull had turned a dull grayish-blue and small, circular lights now outlined the entire rim. The UFO dipped and undulated, following the contours of a small depression to the north of the witness\' house, then tilted sharply and shot up into the sky at terrific speed, in total silence. Since most of the other houses in her neighborhood were unoccupied at that time of year, Mrs. Starr was the sole witness to this strange appearance, although there had been previous reports during the preceding weeks of objects sighted in the area. Because of her background, and because she had no conceivable reason to invent or embellish such a story, neither Miss Davis nor Mr. Hall could find any reason to dismiss her report out of hand. source:http://www.nicap.org/newlook/section_VII.htm', 'This piece of metal was picked up after a UFO explosion over Toninha's Beach, in Ubatuba, Sao Paula State, Brazil, in 1957. This sample was analyzed and the results showed a  99.99% pure magnesium. This other piece fell down from one of the three UFO's that had flown over the city of Caminas, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, on December, 1954. Tests proved the material to be 88.91% pure tin. Mr. Sued gave all three pieces of metal to Dr. Fontes, who in turn had one of them analyzed at the Mineral Production Laboratory of the Department of Mineral Production in the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture. Dr. Fontes personally delivered the samples to the chief chemist, Dr. Fiegl, an internationally known specialist. A qualitative, acid test was first made on a small chip, which showed that the fragments were truly metallic.One of the original fragments, designated Sample No.1 by Dr. Fontes, was subdivided into several pieces and two of the pieces were submitted to the Spectrographic Section of the Mineral Production Laboratory Semi-Quantitative Emmission Spectrochemical Analysis. One of the pieces was analyzed by Dr. Luisa Maria A. Barbosa. The analysis surprisingly revealed that the sample contained only the element magnesium. A second fragment of Sample No.1 was submitted to a separate spectrographic analysis by Mr. Elson Teixeira of the Mineral Production Laboratory. Mr. Teixeira confirmed Dr. Barbosa's finding that Sample No.1 was pure magnesium. Further tests were run on fragments of Sample No. 1. These included Debye-Scherrer-Hull powder pattern X-ray diffraction analysis, density measurement, and radiation tests. The significance of Dr. Barbosa's and Mr. Teixeira's findings is that it is impossible to produce any element, terrestrially, that is absolutely spectrographically pure. These results, therefore, are often cited by proponents of UFO extraterrestrial existence as proof that the Ubatuba material must be EXTRATERRESTRIAL. Unfortunately, this supposition cannot be proven, due to the lack of any further Sample No.1 fragments for verification analysis. The Ubatuba incident is certainly in need of futher verification, especially the details of the UFO incident itself. All we have is the word of one anonymous person who wrote the letter received by a newspaper. The case itself is dated by the receipt of the letter, and not the incident of the crash, so there are no first hand witnesses to the UFO incident itself.Source: The Encyclopedia of UFOs, 374, Ron StoryWalter W.

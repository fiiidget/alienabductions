1971,'US Aircraft Carrier Stopped by a UFO! in Bermuda Triangle, 1971This encounter occurred in 1971, while aboard the aircraft carrier, USS John F. Kennedy CVA-67 (now CV-67) in the Bermuda Triangle. I was assigned to the communications department of the Kennedy and had been in this section about a year. The ship was returning to Norfolk, VA after completing a two week operational readiness exercise (ORE) in the Caribbean. We were to stand down for 30 days, after arriving in Norfolk, Virginia, to allow the crew to take leave and visit family before deploying to the Mediterranean for six months. I was on duty in the communications center. My task was to monitor eight teletypes printing the 'Fleet Broadcasts'. On the top row were four teletypes each printing messages from four different channels. On the bottom row were four more doing the exact same thing except the signal was carried on different frequencies. If one of the primary receivers started taking 'hits' I would be able to retrieve the message from the bottom one. I also notified Facilities Control of any hits so they could tune the receivers. On the other side of the compartment(room) was the NAVCOMMOPNET (Naval Communications Operations Network). This was the Ship to Shore circuit with the top teletype being the receive and the bottom as the send (known as a duplex circuit). Next to this was the Task Group Circuit for ship to ship communications (task group operations or TGO). It was in the evening, about 20:30 (8:30 PM) and the ship had just completed an eighteen hour 'Flight Ops'. I had just taken a message off one of the broadcasts and turned around to file it on a clip board. When I turned back to the teletypes the primaries were typing garbage. I looked down to the alternates which were doing the same. I walked a few feet to the intercom between us and the Facilities Control. I called them and informed them of the broadcasts being out. A voice replied that all communications were out. I then turned and looked in the direction of the NAVCOMMOPNET and saw that the operator was having a problem. I then heard the Task Group operator tell the watch officer that his circuit was out also. In the far corner of the compartment was the pneumatic tubes going to the Signal bridge (where the flashing light and signal flag messages are sent/receive). There is an intercom there to communicate with the Signal Bridge and over this intercom we heard someone yelling 'There is something hovering over the ship!' A moment later we heard another voice yelling. 'IT IS GOD! IT\'S THE END OF THE WORLD!'.  We all looked at each other, there were six of us in the Comm Center, and someone said, 'Lets go have a look!'. The Comm Center is amidships, just under the flight deck, almost in the center of the ship. We went out the door, through Facilities Control and out that door, down the passageway (corridor) about 55 feet to the hatch that goes out to the catwalk on the edge of the flight deck (opposite from the 'Island' or that part of the ship where the bridge is). If you have ever been to sea, there is a time called the time of no horizon. This happens in the morning and evening just as the sun comes up or goes down over the horizon.  During this time you cannot tell where the sea and sky meet. This is the time of evening it was. As we looked up, we saw a large, glowing sphere. Well it seemed large, however, there was no point of reference. That is to say, if the sphere were low; say 100 feet above the ship, then it would have been about two to three hundred feet in diameter. If it were say 500 feet about the ship then it would have been larger. It made no sound that I could hear. The light coming from it wasn\'t too bright, about half of what the sun would be. It sort of pulsated a little and was yellow to orange.  We didn\'t get to looked at it for more than about 20 seconds because General Quarters (Battle stations) was sounding and the Communication Officer was in the passageway telling us to get back into the Comm Center. We returned and stayed there (that was out battle station). We didn\'t have much to do because all the communication was still out. After about 20 minutes, the teletypes started printing correctly again. We stayed at General Quarters for about another hour, then secured. I didn\'t see or hear of any messages going out about the incident.  Over the next few hours, I talked to a good friend that was in CIC (combat information center) who was a radar operator. He told me that all the radar screens were just glowing during the time of the incident. I also talked to a guy I knew that worked on the Navigational Bridge. He told me that none of the compasses were working and that the medics had to sedate a boatswains mate that was a lookout on the signal bridge. I figured this was the one yelling it was God. It was ironic that of the 5,000 men on a carrier, that only a handful actually saw this phenomenon. This was due to the fact that flight Ops had just be completed a short time before this all started and all the flight deck personnel were below resting. It should be noted that there are very few places where you can go to be out in the open air aboard a carrier. From what I could learn, virtually all electronic components stopped functioning during the 20 minutes or so that what ever it was hovered over the ship. The two Ready CAPs (Combat Air Patrol), which were two F-4 Phantoms that are always ready to be launched, would not start.  I heard from the scuttlebutt (slang - rumor mill) that three or four 'men in trench coats' had landed, and were interviewing the personnel that had seen this phenomena. I was never interviewed, maybe because no one knew that I had seen it.  A few days latter, as we were approaching Norfolk, the Commanding and Executive Officers came on the closed circuit TV system that we had. They did this regularly to address the crew and pass on information. During this particular session the Captain told us how well we did on the ORE and about our upcoming deployment to the Mediterranean. At the very end of his spiel, he said 'I would like to remind the crew, that certain events that take place aboard a Naval Combatant Ship, are classified and are not to be discussed with anyone without a need to know'. This was all the official word I ever received or heard of the incident.  Being young and excited about my visit home and going to the Med, I completely forgot about it until years later when my wife and I went to see 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' at the movies when it first came out. In fact the friend that had been the radar operator was with his wife and went with us. As we walked across the parking lot to my car, I ask him if he remembered what We had experienced years earlier on the ship. He looked at me and said he never wanted to talk about it again. As he said it he turned a little pale. I never talked about the incident again. When I discovered 'Aliens and Strange Phenomenon' on MSN and started reading the posts I started thinking about it again. Now I seem obsessed in finding out all I can about this phenomena. source:Jim Kopf Mt. Airy, Maryland Submitted to UFO Casebook', '1971 Bizarre UFO Encounter at Texas Uranium Mine  The summer of 1971, I was working the night shift for Conoco Oil Co. at an open pit uranium mine west of Karnes City Tx.    I was one of 6 people operating Caterpillar 657B earth movers. We were down to about 210 feet deep when this incident happened. It was about 11:10 PM , just after shift change we were getting ready to crank our machines, when the 85 acre pit lit up as if it was daylight. The light was so bright that I had to squint because it hurt my eyes. I remember hearing a high pitched hissing noise and the hair on my arms stood on end. I was so scared, I fell to the ground and started praying. I remember trying to look up, but the light was so bright I couldn\'t. After about 2 minutes, the light started getting dimmer and I could finally look up at it. What I saw amazed me. The object was round and the bright light was coming from the center of the bottom of the UFO. Around the perimeter of the craft was hundreds of penlight size light beams that alternated in all colors of the spectrum. Now I know they were laser beams. The UFO was rising up slowly at first and then went straight up out of sight in about 10 seconds. I was crying and shaking and so was everyone else. The other shift workers thought we were crazy when we told them what had happened. But we got the last laugh. This is how we proved it actually happened.    There is a vein of uranium ore that runs from George West Texas to almost Texarkana Texas. When determining where to place a mine, the following steps are accomplished: (1) A geologist with a geiger counter flies over the area and finds the highest radiation reading. (2) Drilling trucks are sent out and core samples are drilled to determine the highest concentration of uranium ore. These core samples are drilled in a grid pattern and every core sample is given a tracking number and logged in showing the concentration and amount of uranium present. (3) The open pit mine is then laid out according to these core samples.    When this UFO incident happened, we were about 2 feet away from a layer of hard rock called the 'tap rock' that laid directly on top of the uranium ore. The uranium ore varied in depth from 6 to 18 inches and had about the same brown color as low grade coal. Two days after this incident, the tap rock was removed to expose the uranium ore. We were astounded to find that the uranium ore was now a chalky white substance that had NO radioactivity at all! There was a 250 foot diameter circle of this chalky material in the center of the pit.    Outside of the circle, the uranium ore was still as potent as before the incident. Core samples don\'t lie. This chalky material was uranium before this incident.    Many a night I have laid in my bed thinking about what happened. I think the UFO needed the uranium for some reason.

Please consider. Thank you.LoriOriginally Compiled by Albert RosalesAfter 1970 went out with a whimper, 1971 began in much the same manner, but a trend was beginning to form. High strangeness reports were becoming more and more commonplace, memories of 1966-1968 came alive. Something was coming down the pipe; something incredible was going to happen. A change was in the air, 1973 was just around the corner, and the world would never be the same.Location. North of Edwards AFB, CaliforniaDate: Summer 1971Time: unknownA small mushroom-shaped craft crashed close to Edwards AFB. It was dull gray (gun-metal) in color with greenish lights, about 3-3, 5 m in diameter and 1.5-2m in height. 3 gray humanoids, including one that was still alive and a human female abductee (Lorraine Dvorak Cordini) were found onboard. The craft, bodies and survivors were moved to Edwards AFB. The witness Debbie Clayton reported that she heard a loud roaring sound and then a loud crash. Outside she could see a cloud of dust several blocks away. She walked over to the crash site and while other civilians were studying the craft, the military arrived, weapons drawn. One of the civilians had been taken photographs and an Air Force officer ripped the camera from his hands and smashed it but didn\'t try to remove the film. The craft had no markings but seemed to be scratched.There were no windows or seams, and it appeared to be molded in one piece. The texture was smooth. The military told the witnesses to leave or be arrested. The military then covered the craft with a large canvas and lifted it with cables attached to the canvas. Once it was loaded, the military left and there was no mention of the incident in the newspapers. The cause of the crash was later established to have been a technical malfunction. Lorraine Dvorak Cordini later was able to remember (despite the fact that the military attempted to erase her memory with the use of drugs, hypnosis, etc) that she had been traveling onboard the UFO from a mothership in space. She was dressed in a tight-fitting pink body suit. Three extraterrestrial crewmen were returning her to Earth in a small pod-like craft. Lorraine soon found herself standing amid the wreckage. One dead alien was far to her left, barely visible from where she stood, another dead alien was about 20 feet in front of her. A military person was apparently kicking the alien\'s dead body. The third alien crewmember was alive and standing about 20 feet from her, dazed, confused and disoriented. She too felt this way. Suddenly she felt a jerk as a military person grabbed her arms, brought them around her back and handcuffed her. As they were hauling her off she received an image in her mind of the 'captain' onboard the mothership. It was a tall, 6\' humanoid in a long white gown, short brown hair, female, which was communicating to Lorraine how sorry she was for not being able to help her and the other aliens, for if they did they would be detected. Her sorrow was apparent. Other aliens were around her and the same feelings of helplessness and frustration were felt. The other aliens resembled small gray humanoids (similar to the ones seen in the movie 'Close Encounters'). Lorraine was then thrown into the backseat of a black limousine. Her next memory was what surfaced in the hypnosis session. Lorraine was lying on a cold metal table in a hangar. Three military persons stood to the left of the table. One may have been an officer because he had a different cap than the fatigue uniforms of the other two persons. Another uniformed military man was at Lorraine\'s head and to the right and to his left was an alien whom Lorraine described as having a pumpkin-shaped head. He had appeared in a childhood experience that previously surfaced during the same hypnosis session. In the childhood experience he was in a spacesuit... Lorraine\'s child\'s mind saw him dangling outside the window in a deep sea diver\'s suit. This alien was about 4 ft tall, his body bulbous and brown. His head bulbous and pumpkin like. Lorraine 'heard' the alien thinking how great he felt about himself and how proud he was to be in the service of the earth military men... he had a smug attitude and the military man next to him showed contempt towards the alien. She was very confused and disoriented. Her next memory was of being yanked off the table and being dragged outside the hangar. There she saw many flashing red lights and screamed, 'My God, that isn\'t a space ship that is the police, my God it is the police.' The military men then sat her on a bus and she ended up in San Francisco stranded and lost.HC addendumSource: Anton Anfalov, CSETIType: H & G?High Strangeness Index: 9Reliability of Source: 10 (Scale of 1-10)Type G: When there is direct contact or interaction between a witness or witnesses with the human or entity, either against as a result of a forced abduction or a voluntary contact.Type H: When there is a report of an alleged crash or force landing of a UFO with recovery of its occupants.

This case has never been debunked, and is still considered as one of the very best physical trace cases involving a UFO landing. Sixteen year old Ron Johnson, along with his dog Snowball, was tending the family sheep when his attention was suddenly drawn to a mushroom-shaped UFO appearing in the night sky. The flying object, metallic with multi-colored lights,  was hovering approximately 75 feet away from Ron among some trees. Johnson estimated the craft was only a few feet above the ground. He estimated the crafts diameter at 6-8 feet.Stunned by what he was looking at, he tried to get a closer look, but the brilliant luminance of the craft did not allow him to make out any additional details. Ron described the craft as making a loud sound, 'like an old washing machine which vibrates.' The glow of the objects bottom increased as it began to rise up into the sky. Ron would later state that he was temporarily blinded by the brightness of the craft as it ascended. After he regained his sight and composure, he ran back to the family house to alert his mother and father, Erma and Durel. The bright,  glowing object was now even higher in the sky.Ron\'s parents came running around the side of the house to get a glimpse of the unusual phenomena.  They arrived just in time to see the object, now big as the full moon, as it disappeared from view. The three Johnsons were shocked to see a glowing ring on the ground, right below where the craft had hovered. There was also a glowing material on some of the trees nearby. Family members would agree that the ground around the glow 'felt strange, like a slick crust, as if the soil was crystallized.' Ron\'s mother\'s fingers went numb, like she had been given a local anesthetic. After they were sure the craft was not returning,  the family settled down for the night.When dawn broke the next day, the family immediately returned to the sight of the glowing ring, and to their surprise, it was still there! The inside and outside of the ring was damp from a rain shower, but the exterior of the ring was amazingly dry. The ring had a crusty appearance, as though the rain had simply ran off, leaving it bone dry. Slightly over a month later, after a snow fall, the white ice had melted both inside and outside of the ring, but the ring itself maintained the snow drift. Investigators experimented with the ring by removing snow from a section of it, and pouring water on the exposed part. The soil would not allow the water to pass through.The Johnsons told their story to the local newspaper, The Delphos Republican.  Reporter Thaddia Smith, along with several members of her family,  drove back out with the Johnsons to see the site of the UFO landing and the strange ring.  Smith\'s report was as follows:'The circle was still very distinct and plain to see. the soil was dried and crusted. The circle or ring was approximately 8 feet across, the center of the ring and the outside area were still muddy from recent rains. The area of the ring that was dried was about a foot across and was very light in color.The object had crushed a dead tree to the ground either when it landed or took off, and from appearance had broken a limb of a live tree when it landed. the broken limb was most unusual, it would snap and break as though it had been dead for quite some time, yet it was green under the bark, and the upper area still had green leaves clinging to its branches. However the lower area looked as though it had been blistered and had a whitish cast. 'Later the same day, Sheriff Enlow, Undersheriff Harlan Enlow, and Kansas State Highway Patrolman Kenneth Yager investigated the ring after being alerted to the factis of the case by Thaddia Smith. Harlan Enlow filed this report:'...we observed a ring shaped somewhat like a doughnut with a hole in the middle. The ring was completely dry with a hole in the middle and outside of the ring mud. There were limbs broken from a tree and a dead tree broken off there. There was a slight discoloration on the trees.' Further experimentation showed the ground under the ring to be dry to a depth of one foot. The ring itself was composed of a whitish substance, which was sent to a laboratory for analysis. The findings were as follows: [it was resolved into fibers which was vegetal in nature and belonged to an organism of the order of Actinomycetales, which is an intermediate organism between bacteria and fungus... family actiniomycete, genus Nocardia... [and is often found together with a fungus of the order Basidomycetes, which may flouresce under certain conditions... one possible interpretation is that high energy stimulation triggered the spectacular growth of the Nocardia and of an existing fungus, and caused the latter to flouresce. There would also be another witness to corroborate Ron Johnson\'s account of the UFO. Sheriff Enlow told the press;'On 11-03-71 Mr. Lester Ensbarger of 416 Argyle St. in Minneapolis advised Deputy Sheriff Leonard Simpson that at approx. 7:30 p.m. 11-02-71 he had observed a bright light descending in the sky in the Delphos area.' The experience of Ron Johnson is still considered as one of the best documented 'ground trace' UFO cases of the past century, and is still unexplainable by any conventional or earthly means. ', '1971, St. Lorenzen, Styria, Austria / Rudi Nagora PhotographsOn September 24, 1959, just before dawn, police officer Robert Dickerson was cruising the city streets in his patrol car when he noticed a bright falling object like a meteor. But instead of 'burning out,' the object took on a larger, ball-like appearance, stopped abruptly, and hovered about 200 feet above the ground. Its glow lit up juniper trees below it.   The patrolman watched the UFO for several minutes, then drove toward it on Prineville Highway, turning in at the airport. The UFO, meanwhile changed color from bright white to a duller reddish-orange color, and dived rapidly to a new position NE of the airport.     The object flew over Redmond Airport, situated southeast of the city of Portland and hovered over the field, where it was observed for several minutes by FAA officials.     At the FAA office, Flight Service Specialist Laverne Wertz had just completed making weather observations minutes before, and had seen nothing unusual. Now Patrolman Dickerson, Wertz, and others studied the hovering object through binoculars. The UFO was round and flat, with tongues of 'flame' periodically extending from the rim.     At 1310Z (5:10 am. PST) official logs show, the UFO was reported to Seattle Air Route Control Center. Logs of the Seattle center show that the report was relayed to Hamilton AFB. The Seattle log continues:     'UFO also seen on the radar at Klamath Falls GCI [Ground Control Intercept site. F-102\'s scrambled from Portland.'     Six F-102 fighters were scrambled from Portland. As they took off, the Air Force radioed the pilots of a B-47 bomber and a F-89 fighter on routine flights nearby, ordering them to join the chase.     As the Redmond Observers studied the UFO, they noticed a high speed aircraft approaching from the southwest. The Redmond log continues:     'As aircraft approached, UFO took shape of mushroom, observed long yellow and red flame from lower side as UFO rose rapidly and disappeared above-clouds.'     The UFO was seen again briefly, hovering about 25 miles south of the airport. Radar continued to show the UFO south of Redmond for about two hours, at various altitude changing from 5.000 feet to 52.000 feet.   sources/references http://www.chez.com/lesovnis/htm/redmond59.htm Portland Oregon Air Traffic Controller report', 'Navy Officer Has UFO \'Close Encounter\' along Secluded CA HighwayAn off duty Navy petty officer second class had just gotten off duty at California\'s then Naval Air Station Miramar when his vehicle suddenly shut off along a dark and secluded piece of Interstate 15.As the man retrieved a gas can from his trunk for what could be a long walk into nearby Kearny Mesa - he hears an unusual sound - 'a release of air' - that draws his attention into the darkness on the other side of the four-lane highway. He sees 'an object of some type that is long, low and extremely streamlined and silohutted.' The year is 1971.Following is his original account of the incident. Only minor editing changes were completed.Original reportIn 1971, I had a close encounter that was later explained to me was a 'Close Encounter of The Second Kind'. My understanding is that a sighting in the sky is an encounter of the first kind, an encounter where the craft has touched down within close range is the second kind and an encounter where there is physical contact is the third kind, such as the movie years ago.Many years prior to the movie, I was on my way home after getting off duty from the Naval Station at Miramar, which is now a Marine Corp Air Station, in San Diego. The year is 1971, it is about 3:00 a.m. there is no traffic and I am headed down interstate 15 and my car is running on gas fumes.About 5 miles from my destination, the vehicle suddenly shuts off and I coast over to the side of the road. I am thinking I am out of gas and would have to walk the rest of the way into the next surburb of Kearny Mesa. I get out of the car and there is no traffic and it is very dark with only a little moonlight. I get a 5 gallon red military issue gas can out of the trunk and stand there trying to figure out what to do. I was flat broke and it was still a week before payday.As I look North and South on the Interstate, not a soul can be seen.A craft silently landsStill looking South as I stand there by the driver side of the door, I hear a release of air as if it is coming from a high pressure nozzle,  and I hear gravel crunching like something heavy is pressing it down. I look across the Interstate which in 1971 was only four lanes and see an object of some type that is long, low and extremely streamlined and silohutted.I keep looking because I was wondering how something could be there when it was not there when I got out of the car and as dark as it was, I never saw any lights or heard any other car engines. At this time, I was still thinking I was looking at an extremely long car kind of like a limousine, but it was much longer. There was total silence and no movement from the vehicle or on the Interstate.Panic took over when I saw that the vehicle was sitting flush on the ground and their were no tires, plus, I could see that it had opaque silver type windows that were paneled, but no other things like door handles or anything that could make it a car. My mind starting putting together the fact that this was no car and the noise I heard earlier was the craft settling down about 40 yards across the Interstate from me. I was scared to death at this point,  and jumped into the car. The only thing I could think of was getting out of there before something came out of the craft.Even though I thought the car would not start, I turned the key and it started and I put it into gear and took off.When I got home, my family got scared because I was in tears and really scared. They had never seen me in this shape before and it frightened them. I told them what I had seen and they believed me, because they knew I was too terrified to make it up.Return to the sceneThe following morning, I went to my neighbor\'s house and asked him to go back with me. We tried the car, but it would not start, it was out of gas. We borrowed money from other neighbors and went back to where the incident occurred. We only saw a slight indentation in the gravel where something had been.I was traumatized by the event and had trouble sleeping for a long time after that. I still cannot sleep with my back to a door. When it first happened, I was so shook up, that I talked to doctors who recommended that I undergo hypnosis to digress to the night of the incident. They kept asking me exactly how long was I there that night and to me it only seemed like a few minutes from start to finish. Others say that I could have been there longer and just do not know it and may have seen more than what I thought.I never underwent the hypnosis, because I do not want to know anymore than what I already know. I know what I saw that night and it will haunt me the rest of my life.Blemish appears on lower calfLater that year, a blemish appeared on the left inside of my lower calf above the ankle. It is about the size of a dime and it has never gone away. Right in the center is a little black dot surrounded by a lighter tan circle. I thought it was some type of skin cancer and went in for a check up, the doctors say no, they have no idea what it is other than a blemish and not to be concerned. Well, I am concerned because I do not know really how long I was there and what happened from the time I stopped to the time I left. I could be from the encounter, but I have no idea.I have seen objects from time to time since then, but they have been in the sky and usually others report them. I have not ever had another close encounter and really do not want to.Thanks for listening, it is good to vent that story from time to time. I just look forward to the day when all of us can be validated when a sighting beyond comparison will take place and it cannot be disputed.Additional descriptionThe craft was a grayish type color and very smooth in appearance. The shape was very aerodynamic with the length being about 18-20 ft. The height was about 6ft. from the bottom of the craft to the top of the slightly dome-shaped top in the center of the craft. There was also what looked like some type of windows or pane devices that were very dark, like a really dark tint on a car or presidential vehicle, but it was not glass, it was some other type of alloy. Although the vehicle looked really light in weight, it had to be heavy,  because it made the gravel crunch as it settled on the shoulder on the side of the roadway. I was standing by the 1968 Plymouth Fury, light blue, on the southside of the interstate, looking across the interstate to the east, that is the direction I heard the escaping rush of air and heard the gravel crunching. UCSD has an observatory of some type now in the area near the sighting. At the time I was there in 1971, a red & white checkered water tank was in the field close by the interstate.'

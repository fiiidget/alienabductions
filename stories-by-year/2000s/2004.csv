2004,' Mexican Military Officials Release Video of UFOsSOURCE: EFE News Agency. DATE: Tuesday, May 11, 2004 7:20 AMMEXICO (EFE) -- In an unprecedented move for this country--and perhaps thewhole world-- military authorities have made public a video showing 11unidentified flying objects (UFOs) captured by an aircraft belonging to theSecretariat of National Defense (SEDENA). This video shall be presentedtoday by journalist and UFO researcher Jaime Maussan.In an exclusive interview with the La Prensa newspaper, Maussan stated thatthe Secretary of National Defense himself, Ricardo Clemente Vega Garcia,authorized the broadcast of this material to both domestic and foreign newsmedia.According to the researcher, the encounter occurred on March 5, when anaircraft belonging to the Mexican Air Force, a Merlin C26/A, was engaged indrug interdiction patrols. At around 17:00 hours it detected the presence of11 objects following it.The routine flight took place between Copalar, Chiapas and the State ofCampeche. The encounter took place near Ciudad del Carmen, Campeche. It wasthere that the aircraft, belonging to the 501st Air Squadron was performingits routine patrol when it suddenly detected the presence of an object onits radar at an elevation of 3500 meters, as well as through its infraredequipment (FLIR).The airplane immediately pursued the object, which according to the videofootage, lost itself in the clouds. Minutes later, the presence of otherobjects -- for a total of 11 -- was detected. They followed the aircraft andsurrounded it.These UFOs were captured on radar and by the FLIR gear. However, they werenever seen by the aircrew despite having been two miles distant from theaircraft at one point. The crew consisted of eight monitoring specialists,among them the pilot, Maj. Magdaleno Castañón Muñoz, radar operator Lt.Germán Martin Ramirez and FLIR operator Mario Adrian Vázquez Tellez. Thesemilitary men were interviewed and claimed having never seen a similarphenomenon, since the speed and movements detected by radar confirmed thefact that the [objects] were not aircraft.Translation (C) 2004.Scott Corrales,  Institute of Hispanic Ufology (IHU).', ' Staffordshire Mini UFO Flap August 2004For those who remember August 2004 in the UK, you'll recall it was cool, wet and thundery, but for Staffordshire UFO Group it was an eventful time. From the start of that month we had been made aware of a sighting by a retired RAF Engineer of an orange ball of light late one night in the area of Cannock. Events took a sudden turn on Saturday 7th when a call was received again from Cannock at 9:55pm. The witness described an orange ball of light seen at around 9:40pm which was silent and stationary with an unusual triangular shaped pattern in its centre. The object hung in the sky for several seconds before shooting away at high speed. The following day more reports came in describing a similar object either shooting across the sky or remaining stationary for short periods. Now statements have been analysed, it is now possible to ascertain that the first sighting occurred in Perton near Wolverhampton at 4:20pm where video footage was taken of 6 silver objects high in the sky in two 'V' shaped formations. Analysis of this footage indicates that the objects are not wind borne with some unusual anomalies that are still being analysed. The second report comes from Shenstone at 5.45pm (again in daylight) of a bluey/white light. Subsequent reports were received from Stafford and Millford of an orange ball of light at around 9:20pm. A photograph was taken at Shugborough Hall showing a curious orb of which the photographer was unaware. Sightings of this orange ball of light often described as having something at its centre were then seen between Stafford and Cannock and later in the areas of Shenstone and Lichfield up until the early hours of the 8th August where again video footage was taken at 2am on the 8th .The strangest thing about these sightings is the shear number of reports that were received, not just from the night time but daytime also. In addition, two independent video recordings were made of both the daytime objects and the orange ball of light. Also two individual photographs were taken, one from Millford, the other in Shenstone.In conclusion and notwithstanding the fact that research is incomplete, the sightings have proved beyond any shadow of doubt that people were witnessing something. The photo and video footage will never prove that the objects witnessed were extraterrestrial but the body of witness testimony adds credence to the evidence surrounding the facts: 'something did happen, something was photographed', ‘something was out there.’ The investigation will continue!source:Graham Allen (SUFOG)Staffordshire UFO GroupNote: The still is from footage taken at approx 2 am 8th August 2004 in Lichfield, Staffordshire, UK.', 'Watching the heavens from Dalnegorsk  December 29, 2004-“I got scared of a UFO only once. It was during a 1980 expedition to Kamchatka when we saw a strange disc landing near a 90-meter-deep lake bottom,” reveals Valery Dvuzhilny, one of Russia’s most notable specialists in the investigation of unidentified flying objects. Dvuzhilny, a biologist by occupation residing in a town of Dalnegorsk some 500 kilometers north of Vladivostok, made investigating UFOs the main purpose of his life. In his four-room apartment, the scientist has established a laboratory equipped with obsolete Soviet-era tools and a collection of about 1,000 samples of materials found at nearby sites where at least one UFO is thought to have touched down. Dvuzhilny was the first to suggest that space visitors use geological fissures in the planet’s crust to orientate themselves with Earth before descent. Dalnegorsk County, which is considered the most anomalous zone in Primorye and is also notable for its 14 caves, is located on a geological “break” that contains a field of powerful electromagnet and gravitational energy. The counties of Ternei and Olga and the city of Arsenyev are also locations of interest for UFO researchers, with more than 10 unexplained sightings in the past 20 years. According to Dvuzhilny, on January 29, 1986, a UFO was observed in the Vysota-611 Mountain near Dalnegorsk. Burnt fragments found at the site revealed the rare-earth metal lanthanum and silicon shales discharging magnetic radiation. In 1995, Dvuzhilny participated in the International UFO Conference in California, America. Pavel Reshetnikov, head of the anti-aircraft forces in the Russian Far East, was also invited to the conference but was prohibited from leaving Russia because of his military status. However, he later confirmed that a UFO was tracked by radar over the Amur River in the early 1990s. According to Reshetnikov, the object could not be identified as either a missile or a plane. Each sample found at the Dalnegorsk site has been subject to multiple scientific tests, including isotope analysis. Of the samples found 50 kilometers away at the Krivaya River, dozens were proven to have been burnt at a temperature exceeding 2,000 degrees C. According to Dvuzhilny, thorough analysis of burnt metal pieces found at sites so remote from each other suggest they were affected by extra-terrestrials, who may have been interested in them as sources of lead and silver. With his modest laboratory tools Dvuzhilny lacks funds to perform his scientific activities. To conduct an isotope analysis in Moscow costs $1,000, but Dvuzhilny, who earns very little money teaching students at an ecology club, does not give up. He is an ample enthusiast, as are his colleagues at the Science and Research center ‘Kosmopoisk’(Search of Cosmos) where Dvuzhilny works as a coordinator. Dvuzhilny, the energetic sky watcher featured in both Japanese and American documentaries, is currently planning an expedition to the Amgu territory, and dreams of creating Russia’s first UFO museum in Dalnegorsk.

The object, which moved in a bizarre fashion said by witnesses to 'drop and stop' near the East Fork vicinity, was sighted by at least three separate persons in Clermont County at 2:58 a.m., early Monday morning, January 12.  Also seen was a shadow that \'transformed into a ball\' -- one person describing a peculiar tannish-brown object, separate from the lighted UFO-which strangely \'rolled down the side of a house.\' The sighting was first reported by one of the witnesses to the Cincinnati UFO hotline on Monday, investigation of the incident has turned up additional witnesses to the incident.   INCIDENT At 2:58 a.m. on Jan. 12th, 2004, 21 year old student Susan T. (name and phone number on file, deleted for this report) and her neighbor Jeff F. were in Susan\'s driveway when they spotted an object high in the sky.  Susan states that the object was hard to describe but said it was disc shaped with a 'hump' on top.  Susan said that at one point the object stopped and began to 'drop.' She thought it was going to hit the ground.  However, it suddenly stopped and hovered and then it began to drop again.  For several minutes this object 'stopped and dropped.'  She finally lost sight of it as it went below roof top level of her house.  Susan went on say that this object must have been 'covered in a million lights' and also said there was a red rotating light on the top of the hump and white lights on what she described as the belly or bottom of the object. She claims that the object seemed to turn on its side so that she could see the bottom part.  This turning or flipping caused the object to look like it was changing shapes and getting bigger.  It was when the object turned up that the 'bottom' was covered in white lights that dimmed then grew brighter and changed patterns. Susan said that the object was -- from her perspective-larger then your thumb at arms length.  She does not know how far away it was but said it may have been over as far as State Route 222. (There are several streets between there; Lumsford and Eiler Lanes.) She said the object may have been in the vicinity of the Phantom Fireworks Factory on Route 125, somewhat to the west of her location. Susan explained that she felt she was being watched and grew very frightened.  Both she and her neighbor (Jeff F.) sat in the truck and watched this object for over an hour.  It was 4:15 a.m. when it finally slowly went down behind her house. Susan then stated that something very strange happened.  Right after the object went behind her house she saw what appeared to be a 'shadow' on her roof that turned into a ball and rolled down the roof.  She said that her neighbor also saw the shadow. Being very frightened neither person went behind the house to see where the object went.  Susan feels that it did land or almost land.  She also said that they did not see the object leave because she ran in into house after it went below the roof level and did not look anymore. I asked if there was any adverse reactions by the animals in the area when the object was in view and Susan said that dogs on the other streets were going wild when the object came down close to the ground. The second witness was then contacted for his comments on the report.  Jeff F., a 45-year old disabled resident of Amelia, states that at 2:58 a.m. on Jan 12th, 2004, he and Susan were sitting in his truck in her driveway when they spotted the object hovering up over behind Susan\'s house.  The object was up very high. They watched as this object began to drop very fast.  It then stopped and hovered and then dropped again.  This all happened very quickly.  Jeff F. states that he looked away for a second and the light was back up in the sky in the same spot where they first saw it.  It dropped and stopped again.  This happened two times.  Jeff F. says he does not know how big the object was but it had a slowly rotating red light on top. I asked if there were other lights and Jeff said that he did not see any other lights nor could he tell the shape.  He said they watched this object for an hour while they sat in his truck. Jeff said this object eventually began to descend behind Susan\'s house.  Just as it went out of view a very weird thing happened.  Jeff F. said that a 'light tannish brown shadow that turned into a ball about the size of a cantaloupe' rolled down Susan\'s roof. 'This happened so fast it was unbelievable,' he said. When this happened both became frightened and Susan ran in the house. Both parties told me that there was a garbage truck coming down the street at the time the object was in view but they do not think the garbage man saw the UFO.   INVESTIGATORS COMMENT Jeff F. and Susan\'s stories differ in some aspects.  Both witnesses sounded sincere in their claims.  Susan still sounds upset about what she saw and expressed to me that she has received little sleep since her sighting.  I find the incident with the 'shadow' very curious.  Both people expressed to me that it was 'something' other then just a shadow, but 'shadow' was the only word they could find to describe it.  It seems that this 'shadow' upset both witnesses the most because the object was too far away to cast any reflection on the roof.` Susan is a 21 year old student at the University of Cincinnati.  She is out of school for the winter but will be back in school for the spring term.  She is taking courses (30-hours per week) to be become an RN. 45-year old Jeff F. is now disabled but was formerly employed as an industrial engineer. Susan informed me that she sometimes has trouble sleeping and she and Jeff F. will sit in his truck to talk so as not to wake her family.  That night they had spotted the UFO. Susan says the object was in the western skies when she first saw it. She says she does not know or could comment on how high the object was, saying she is not very good at judging distances. Jeff also said he could not guess on how high up this object was in darkness. ADDITIONAL WITNESS Through various telephone inquires of neighboring residents in the area contact was made with one other possible witness. A resident from a few blocks away (Eiler Rd) spoke with me by phone (name and phone number on file, withheld from this report) and said that around 3:30 a.m. on Monday morning, January 12, she looked out her window towards the West and saw a bright light in the vicinity of State Route 222.  She did not know how high this object was but said it was a very big bright light above the trees. She said that from her perspective, the object was in a westerly direction toward the lake (East Fork).  She could not give a clear estimate of elevation but claimed to have watched this object for a couple of minutes. After it allegedly disappeared she went back to bed.The time and date of the claimed sighting, plus general location of the alleged object, matches detail furnished by the first two witnesses from Yelton St. INVESTIGATION I contacted the Clermont County Sheriff\'s Dept. at 513-732-2231.  No UFO sightings were reported to them during this time frame. Next, I contacted the Bethel Police Dept. at 513-734-2256.  No UFO sightings were reported during this time to them. Additionally, researcher Kenny young placed a call to the Clermont Sun Newspaper '465 E. Main St., Batavia, Ohio, 513-732-2511.'  He spoke with the editor, Art Hunter.  He was told they had not heard of any UFO sightings. Next, Young contacted the office at East Fork Lake State Park 513-734-4323.  The telephone receptionist, Sandy, said she was completely unfamiliar with UFO sightings around the East Fork State Park vicinity.  She did inquire about the witnesses.  She explained that she would pass the information along to the supervisor, others in the office and the park rangers who patrol the lake at night.  She took Young\'s telephone number and e-mail address and attached them to her report.  Young said if anyone had information about this story to feel free to contact him. http://home.fuse.net/ufo/eastfork04.htmlFiled 1/13/04 Donnie Blessing Southern Ohio State Section Director MUFON ', 'California - Airline Pilot Sights a UFO SAN FRANCISCO -- An airline transport pilot with 14 years\' experience in commercial aviation can\'t quite explain what he saw at 11 PM,  November 3, 2004.  The jetliner P.A. was flying was making its approach into San Francisco.   The jetliner was approaching the city from the east, passing just north of Stockton, when P.A. received instructions from the tower to descend from 35,000 to 24,000 feet (10,500 to 7,200 meters).  And then it happened.        'While approaching San Francisco from the east,' he reported, 'an orange dot began to glow and seemed to flash higher up to the west of us.  I thought that it was a planet.  It then changed color from orange to white.  Again, I thought a planet could be illuminated through a (local) atmosphere that would explain the color change.'   'It then began to move in a northeasterly direction.  Once again, being in an airplane, it is very easy to think an object is moving, from small corrections the autopilot makes.  I found a handful of stars to serve as a reference point and verified that the object was slowly moving north.   It moved about 30 degrees and then stopped.  Then, it made a slight tangent to the right and continued moving for about 20 more degrees.'  'It stopped and turned again to the right and continued for 10 degrees, then stopped again and disappeared.' 'The whole sighting ran about two minutes or so from start to finish. It was difficult to judge the actual distance and speed.  When I talk about \'moving in degrees and turning,\' I am talking about my (cockpit) viewpoint and compass degrees.'  'The UFO\'s size was very small, about the size of the stars and planets you see in the sky.'   'We had initially been at 35,000 feet (10,500 meters) but had descended to 24,000 feet (7,200 meters) when we saw the object.  We were above the clouds with a clear view, and there was a crescent moon behind us.  The weather in San Francisco was partly cloudy skies and light rain.'   'There were two of us in the cockpit, and we both witnessed the same thing.  We were both in awe.  I have been flying for 14 years have never witnessed something like this before.' source:Thanks to UFO Roundup Vol. 9, # 45, November 10, 2004, Editor: Joseph Trainor  http://www.ufoinfo.com/roundup/', '2004-Pascoe Vale, Australia, UFOS: Twin Black Triangles2004-Pascoe Vale UFOS: Twin Triangles  By Tom Levine One summer evening, August 23rd, 2004, something very unusual happened over the State of Victoria, near Melborne, in the southern tip of Australia. Very strange, unexplainable lights appeared to hover low in the sky. Multiple witnesses saw the phenomenon, it was caught on camera, and it was captured on video by two separate witnesses. At approximately 8:30pm, the UFOs reached Pascoe Vale. It was then, that they appeared before the residence of Mark and Janine Blease. These witnesses were smart enough to grab their video camera. The Blease family captured one of the most mysterious pieces of UFO video evidence ever to claim the imagination of the folks from the land down under. Eleven witnesses were interviewed in total. Video footage, testimony, and photographic evidence all corroborated the sighting. The formation was moving over Melbourne while the video was taken at a location near Pascoe Vale. The objects were in two groups of three lights and each group was in a triangle formation.The video was taken by Mark & Janine Blease of Melbourne. PRA have a copy of the video for analysis and so does Channel 7 TV Melbourne. A check of Melbourne Air Traffic Control, show no aircraft at that location or in formation at that time and no radar contact was reported.On the Breakfast Show - Radio station 3AW Melbourne, spoke to the couple who took the video and they said it was quite a surprise and very spectacular, offering no explanation. Other people called the radio station and some did come onto the 'talk-back' line to support the sighting.This is a multiple witness event and a hoax has been ruled out. At present there is no simple explanation, however an investigation has now been opened and as more information becomes available we will post it.', 'Huge Triangular Object Sighted in Tennessee 2004Witness reported that at 05:30 hours this morning he was driving home when he noted what first appeared to be a fire on a ridge nearby. As he drove, he got closer to the 'fire' and realized that it was not a fire at all but a series of three reddish orange lights affixed to the bottom of a huge triangular object. He neared an intersection and exited his car to watch the metallic craft as it approached from the north and moving directly toward him. He noted his fear and started to run from his car but realized that there was nowhere to go. As the giant object passed overhead, it blocked out all the stars and he estimated the size to be some 300 feet in length. The bottom of the craft was somewhat illuminated from the three flame-like, symmetrical appendages on the bottom and he described what appeared to be 'ribs' running across the bottom of the object. As it passed directly overhead, he was exposed to something which seemed to reverberate through his body. He stated that he felt many sensations all at once, but no description could be found for what he actually felt. He also noted the object made a pulsating/drumming-like noise which also passed throughout his body.The object passed him and suddenly turned west, without banking and moved behind nearby hills.At this time MUFON Tennessee has determined that the possibility exists that this witness may have been injured by this 'CE-2', or close encounter case. Witness has reported a metallic taste in his mouth today and nose bleeds. This may or may not be related to this close encounter.Update:This preliminary report will be revised and edited as information becomes available.Remember, this is only the preliminary findings and must be investigated fully before any determinations are made.It should be also noted that this witness is a MUFON member and 100% honest and trustworthy.UPDATE! 10-04-04Witness visited Shaffer for an interview. He is sick, his face and back are slightly burned, his hair is falling out. He had a nose-bleed and has a metallic taste in his mouth.He wants to go to the emergency room but does not know what to tell them happened to him. I fear he may have been exposed to some kind of exotic radiation.UPDATE! 10-06-04Today DR Mel Redfern, DCH (my assistant state director for MUFON TN) and myself conducted a more in depth interview of the witness in the Oct 2nd triangle sighting case. It now appears that this is a missing time case as well, noting that the witness admitted that his watch had lost 15 minutes (at least) and that it is a fairly dependable watch prior to the event and afterwards, having never lost any time before.The medical condition seems to have improved for now as his face and back are no longer burning like they were and his lethargic state seems to have passed. He has suffered no more nosebleeds or after effects.The case will be ongoing until all aspects have addressed fully.

1990,'The Aegean Sea - 08-15-199008-15-1990USOs or Unidentified Submarine Objects have long been observed in Turkish waters. That is, such crafts are often reported to enter, leave, float or travel under the water of seas, lakes and rivers of Turkey.In this respect, the Aegean Sea, the Marmara Sea and the Mediterranean Sea are very active water regions. Below we would get into some further details of the most interesting USO case of all Turkish UFO literature. Here it is.In August of 1990, a strange underwater UFO was seen beneath the waters of the Aegean Sea which lies between Turkey and Greece. What makes this USO encounter so special is that it includes a colored picture of an alleged Unidentified Submersible Object as a physical evidence.Furthermore, we should add that the eye-witness and the USO are both under the water. Naturally, there are some amazing photographs, motion pictures and video-clips of USOs showing that these mysterious objects are diving into, emerging from, sailing or cruising under the water.However, there was no single evidential picture indicating that the alleged submarine UFO and the photographer were both beneath the sea at some fathoms. As far as we know, this alleged USO photo is therefore the first example of its kind.This spectacular USO case occurred at 14:00 (2 pm.), on 15th of August, 1990. Its exact place was at 57 meters deep of Saros Bay or just around Turkish inland waters of the Aegean Sea.One can easily state that Mr. Erol Erkmen is a very reliable and sincere person who has reported this mysterious underwater object. Mr. Erkmen was engaging in a discovery-dive for an old sunken ship together with his friend, named as Mr. Kemal whose surname has been kept as secret, when he suddenly located the alleged USO there.Mr. Erol Erkmen said that he began to feel very strangely as if they were observed by something. Then he looked ahead and saw a greenish light inside the water. However, this mysterious object disappeared so soon. After a while, Mr. Erkmen again located the green object at his left-hand side. Consequently, he thought that the USO might have been maneuvering around them.He observed it for nearly 3 minutes. Then he decided to take a picture of this strange light using an older underwater Kodak camera. Immediately he did what he had thought.As soon as Mr. Erkmen took a snap-shot of that USO, its light went out. However, they had to come out of the water, since their oxygen was just about to die out. Mr. Erol Erkmen said that when he studied the negative very carefully, he saw nothing.On the other hand, when he looked up the printed photochrome, he located a mysterious greenish light in the picture. For his curiosity, he made this photograph enlarged for 300 times. He then became too embarrassed by seeing that there was a disc-shaped object with some greenish light in the alleged photo.If so, what was that? Was it a conventional submarine or a secret man-made vehicle? Was it a kind of phosphorescent underwater organism? Or was it an advanced submersible craft of alien beings? Who knows? Every alternative view has its own pros and cons.Written by Sefer Murat Aksoy, B.A. & M.S. Independent UFO Researcher of TurkeyTurkey USO Sightings: Sefer Murat Aksoy, 1999-2000).', 'Pitlochry UFO Case - The Missing PhotographsWhile most reports of flying saucers are quickly dismissed by defence chiefs, the previously classified papers show the sighting, which took place near Pitlochry in 1990, was taken extremely seriously.A former MoD official who investigated the case told Scotland on Sunday that despite strenuous efforts they could find no earthly explanation for the craft.Witnesses reported seeing a large, diamond-shaped object hanging in the air next to a RAF Harrier above the A9 at Calvine, north of Pitlochry, on August 4, 1990.The UFO is said to have hovered for about 10 minutes before zooming skywards at high speed and disappearing from view.The apparent close encounter of the Caledonian kind was photographed by members of the public whose images appear to show a blurry, diamond-shaped craft next to a jet.Fearing the pictures would spark significant media interest, the MoD decided to bring it to the attention of the Government.A Whitehall official wrote in a memo: “Such stories are not normally drawn to the attention of ministers. “On this occasion, however, the MoD has been provided with six photographic negatives of an alleged UFO… and has been asked for comments almost certainly for inclusion in a forthcoming story.”The memo suggested the media should be told that “no definite conclusion had been reached regarding the large diamond-shaped object”.It has also emerged the MoD went on to commission a series of line drawings of the object the following year.More info from old UFO Casebook article:The photographs have been misplaced, lost, or hidden, and have never surfaced.The MOD's UFO Project had also been sent a number of intriguing photos and videos of UFOs, and had the means to have the images enhanced and analysed by various technical specialists.Some intriguing images had arrived via the Scottish Daily Record in 1990, and a poster-sized photograph had been produced from one of the negatives and pinned to my (?) office wall by one of my predecessors.The photograph had been taken in daylight and showed a vast, diamond-shaped UFO, metallic silver in colour, apparently hovering low over the Scottish countryside.The photograph was removed in 1994 by the then head of the division, who had convinced himself that the picture showed a secret prototype aircraft codenamed Aurora - a hypersonic replacement for the SR-71 Blackbird that the US Government denied existed.A question was asked in Parliament in 1996 about the location of this photograph, and the matter has subsequently been raised in a Freedom of Information Act request. Unfortunately, the photograph had disappeared, and could not be located.', '1990 - The Place Bonaventure Incident - Montreal, Quebec, CanadaFair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

The adventure of 23-year-old Antonio Villas Boas on 16 October 1957 in Brazil is probably the most famous case of interstellar intercourse. Antonio was ploughing a field on the family farm when the engine of his tractor cut out; at the same time, an object with purple lights descended from the sky. Humanoids in spacesuits emerged from the object and took him into their craft, subjecting him to what seemed like a medical examination. They stripped him, spread a strange liquid over him and took a sample of his blood. He was left alone in a room for what seemed a long time, until a beautiful, fair-haired woman arrived. She was naked and Antonio was instantly attracted to her. Without speaking or kissing, they had sex, during which she growled like a dog. Despite his strange circumstances or perhaps because the alien liquid had Viagra-like properties Antonio was soon ready for a second helping. Interviewed later, he said: 'Before leaving she turned to me, pointed to her belly, and smilingly pointed to the sky.' Before letting him go, his captors gave Antonio a guided tour of the spaceship. Antonio went on to become a successful lawyer and still stood by his story over 30 years later. Equally lurid stories of sexual liaisons with UFO occupants came from the world-famous contactees of the 1950s. Howard Menger, for one, had regular meetings with Marla, a beautiful blonde from space who claimed to be 500 years old. She projected 'warmth, love and physical attraction,' which he found irresistible. Menger divorced his wife to marry Marla (aka Connie Weber). From July 1952, Truman Bethurum had many meetings with Aura Rhanes, the captain of a flying saucer, whom he found to be 'tops in shapeliness and beauty'. Bethurum\'s wife wasn\'t so impressed with this 'queen of women' and cited Rhanes in her divorce petition. From the late Forties to the early Sixties, female contactees in contrast to today\'s female abductees are few and far between. This is more than made up for by the astonishing story of Elizabeth Klarer, who in 1956 fell in love with Akon, a scientist who took her to his home planet, Meton. There, he seduced her, saying: 'Only a few are chosen for breeding purposes from beyond this solar system to infuse new blood into our ancient race.' This smooth talk worked; 'I surrendered in ecstacy to the magic of his lovemaking,' she wrote later. Klarer said their 'magnetic union' produced a perfect and highly intelligent son named Ayling. She was sent back to South Africa alone and died in 1994; as far as we know her starman and son live on somewhere beyond Alpha Centauri. Rather ordinary tales of \'contact\' are thus transformed into heroic fantasies of youthful virility. Antonio Villas Boas claimed to have done what any healthy young man would have done in the same situation; he and Elizabeth Klarer delivered the goods, helping to save an alien race from extinction. Scientific ufologists, more interested in \'hard\' evidence (like radar traces, photographs and forensic samples) condemn this \'wet\' material as too subjective, relegating claims of sexual assault and abduction to the fields of psychology and folklore (which they likewise distrust). The early contactee literature provides a rich variety of such stories and, whatever their validity, it is a pity they have been largely neglected or ridiculed. When ufologist John Keel visited college communities in Northeast America during the mid-1960s, several young women told him they had been raped by aliens, and young men confessed that aliens had extracted their semen. By the 1970s, the idea of hybrid \'space babies\' was more widely known but taken seriously only by UFO cultists who, said Keel, feared, that 'the flying saucer fiends are engaged in a massive biological experiment creating a hybrid race which will eventually take over the Earth.' A decade later, these notions were part of mainstream ufology. Serious researchers some of them academics, like John E. Mack and David Jacobs openly declared their belief that the \'Greys\' were taking sperm and ova from human abductees. It was common to hear female abductees tell of being impregnated, of the ftus taken from their wombs, and of later being shown their hybrid babies in a nursery on a flying saucer. Historically, pregnancy and abortion have been surrounded by a constellation of myths and old wives\' tales and it is, perhaps, no surprise to find UFO mythology being used to explain unexpected pregnancies, \'mysterious\' discharges and missing or malformed babies. In the 1970s, a 19-year-old Californian girl attributed the birth of a blue-skinned, web-footed baby to being gang raped by six blue-skinned web-footed humanoids who attacked her after she watched their spaceship land on a beach. Similar stories of lusty mermen (the ocean has some affinity with space) can be found in folklore and are usually given as explanation for the birth of deformed babies with reptilian or fish-like characteristics. Some researchers are aware of intriguing similarities between the lore of witches and fairies and modern abduction reports, and nocturnal sexual encounters with supernatural beings of all types can be found in most cultures to the present day. In the past, hundreds of men and women confessed (not always under torture) to sexual intercourse with demons. Some shapeshifting demons were said to lie with a man (as a succubus) to obtain sperm and then (as an incubus) impregnate a woman with it. Ufologists, in particular, have been aware of the structural similarities between accounts of fairy and alien encounters. A recent study by James Pontolillo compared 1517th century accounts of sexual relations with demons to 20th century encounters with aliens and concluded that both traditions expressed a fundamental fear of female sexuality but today the male body and mind are just as likely to be under attack. Communion author Whitley Strieber famously described being sodomised by a narrow, 1ft (0.3m)-long alien probe. He felt that, while inside him, it seemed alive and was surprised, on its removal, to find it was a mechanical device. In my own research I have interviewed \'Martin Bolton\' who had visions of, and telepathic communications with, three young space women. On behalf of these entities, he window-shopped for female attire and watched porn films. They were the \'goodies\'; the \'baddies\' beamed pain to his brain and for a three-year period stretched his penis during the night. On several occasions they afflicted him with phantom pregnancies. Ridley Scott\'s movie Alien (1979) dramatised the nature of the alien sexual assaults; the proof of their inhumanity is that they don\'t always differentiate between the sexes or even between species. Historian David Jacobs who offers accounts, in his book, of abductees compelled to have sex with fellow victims while aliens watched speaks for many who believe that the apparently spontaneous experience of abduction by so many different people implies the phenomenon really exists as an objective threat. Yet Rogerson has demonstrated that most of the elements of the abduction narrative appeared together as early as 1967 in 'The Terror Above Us' by Malcolm Kent. This science fiction novel anticipated such ufological themes as the \'Oz factor\' (the sensation of being transported to a different reality), the supernatural cold, the doorway amnesia (the informant cannot remember what went on inside a room after entering), the alien in disguise, and impersonal scientists experimenting on humans. For good measure, the story also includes a male protagonist having his genitals examined before sex with an alien female. Another critic of the hybrid-breeding idea is British ufologist Peter Brookesmith, who compared the described activities of the alien \'doctors\' with the procedures used by terrestrial fertility specialists. He found that the alien inseminators singularly fail to take their subjects at the premium time for egg removal, namely within 48 hours of ovulation. And the aliens are just as likely to be confused by \'missing\' fetuses as are humans, given the general difficulty of diagnosing pregnancy within the first eight weeks. For all their cosmic superiority, the alien inseminators can make pretty elementary, and farcical, errors. Aliens inserted a long needle into Betty Andreasson\'s navel. They said their purpose had to do with creation and were puzzled to find \'something\' missing. Andreasson had to explain to them that she\'d had a hysterectomy. Whatever the genesis of such reports, we have to consider that folk have reported sexual contact with all manner of supernatural beings throughout history. Either the aliens have been conducting their beastly experiments for millennia, or such stories meet some deep-seated socio-psychological need. Until any solid medical evidence is provided, the latter hypothesis seems the more likely. This article by NIGEL WATSON can be found in Fortean Times 121.

', 'The Foo-FightersWW II Document Research  (In search of 'Foo-Fighters') By Andy Roberts (Originally published in: UFO BRIGANTIA No 66, JULY 1990) Every student of the history of UFOs knows of the phenomenon seen during WWII and known as foo-fighters, kraut fireballs or a variety of other names. Basically they were balls of light which followed and hovered around `planes of all nationalities both in daylight and after dark.Research into this subject has been undertaken by myself on behalf of the Fund for UFO Research. Foo-fighter research shows the genesis of the modern UFO age and during my research I came across the old chestnut of the dreaded government 'cover-ups'. For many ufologists WWII is the time when the cover-up really began and there are intimations in many writers\' books (Keel, Fawcett, Good for example) that both the US and UK governments were involved in separate studies of the foo-fighter phenomenon. These subjects are several articles long in themselves and we won\'t go into them here, but for the record so far there is no documentary evidence of a cover-up of WWII UFO sightings, or even much interest on any government\'s part. No, what we are trying to get to here are the facts surrounding one particular case of a WWII foo-fighter sighting, the cover-up implications and how ufology has dealt with it. So, as the walls melt and voices become fuzzy, let me take you back, back, back ... OK, it\'s October 14th 1943 and you\'re a bomb aimer in a B-17 going in amongst the flak for the final run over the ball-bearing factories at Schweinfurt in Germany, a trouser filling experience which us young folk can\'t even begin to imagine, but for this particular bomber wave they had more than flak to contend with. According to Martin Caidin who wrote Black Thursday(1960) which deals exclusively with the Shweinfurt raid: 'During the bomb run of several groups, starting at about the time the Fortresses approached the Initial Point, there occurred one of the most baffling incidents of World War II, and an enigma that to this day defies all explanation.' 'As the bombers of the 384th Group swung into the final bomb run after passing the Initial Point, the fighter attacks fell off. This point is vital, and pilots were queried extensively, as were other crew members, as to the position at that time of the German fighter planes. Every man interrogated was firm in his statement that 'at the time there were no enemy aircraft above.' 'At this moment the pilots and top turret gunners, as well as several crewmen in the Plexiglas noses of the bombers, reported a cluster of discs in the path of the 384th\'s formation and closing with the bombers. The startled exclamations focused attention on the phenomenon and the crews talked back and forth, discussing and confirming the astonishing sight before them.' 'The discs in the cluster were agreed upon as being silver colored, about one inch thick and three inches in diameter. They were easily seen by the B-17 crewmen, gliding down slowly in a very uniform cluster.' 'And then the `impossible\' happened. B-17 Number 026 closed rapidly with a number of discs; the pilot attempted to evade an imminent collision with the objects, but was unsuccessful in his maneuver. He reported at the intelligence debriefing that his right wing 'went directly through a cluster with absolutely no effect on engines or plane surface.' 'The intelligence officers pressed their questioning, and the pilot stated further that one of the discs was heard to strike the tail assembly of his B-17, but that neither he nor any member of the crew heard or witnessed an explosion.' 'He further explained that about twenty feet from the discs the pilots sighted a mass of black debris of varying sizes of clusters of three by four feet.' 'The SECRET report added: `Also observed two other A/C flying through silver discs with no apparent damage. Observed discs and debris two other times but could not determine where it came from.\'' 'No further information on this baffling incident has been uncovered, with the exception that such discs were observed by pilots and crew on missions prior to, and after, Mission 115 of October 14, 1943.' Caidin\'s account of the events of 14/10/43 has since been cited, quoted from and faithfully reproduced with not the slightest hint of analysis in over 20 UFO books. Tim Good\'s Above Top Secret uses the case to back up an as yet fictional WWII study of UFOs by one General Massey, and it is used both to support the \'UFOs were around in WWII\' school of thought but more so to hint at the birth of official cover-ups. Why? Well because in Caidin\'s book the account is footnoted '1 Memorandum of October 24, 1943, from Major E.R.T. Holmes, F.L.O., 1st Bombardment Division, Reference FLO/IBW/REP/126, to M.I.15, War Office, Whitehall, London, SW (copy to Colonel E.W. Thomson, A-2, Pinetree)', leaving us in no doubt that 'they' knew all about this UFO sighting and had full documentation (at least two copies, not to mention any subsequent memoranda). But did they really? In fact, did the event ever really happen at all? I\'m not so sure it did. When I first discovered the account I began to see what could be found out about it -- it\'s obviously well-referenced and so should be easy to check out ... A letter to the M.O.D at their Air Historical Branch 5 came to nothing, suggesting that either of the documents may be held at the Public Records Office at Kew, London. A professional researcher was despatched to try to find the document. She searched all relevant Air Force records available (some are still bound by various `rules\' with embargos on viewing of up to 100 years) but could find nothing, despite the help of staff there and noting that 'the reference FLO etc. does not correspond with any references at the record office.' In the USA, Dennis Stacy (MUFON Journal editor) had taken an interest in the case and followed up several leads, aided by the Freedom of Information Act. Firstly the A.F. Historical Research centre at Maxwell AFB searched their 8th A.F. files but could come across no documentary record of the event (interestingly enough I tried the same source and whilst they gave me squadron histories of the 415th Night Fighter squadron and their documented foo-fighter sightings, they could provide nothing on the Schweinfurt raid -- odd if the Schweinfurt events were real). The National Archives (Washington) searched their files but drew a blank. A letter written to French researcher J. M. Bigorne from the National Archives stated 'A search in records of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS), European War, Target Damage File, 11a (2606), Schweinfurt, failed to disclose any documentation or information regarding little flying discs by B-17 pilots.' All this presents us with a quandary. If the Archives are quite free about some foo-fighter info why, if it exists at all, should they be that bothered about concealing the Schweinfurt material? So far three independent researchers over the past ten years have had the same answer -- none of the flight records for that day record the event in Caidin\'s book. As I have seen other pilots\' logs which mention unusual UFO-type sightings during missions it would be inconceivable for at least a few aircrew on that raid to have mentioned it even in passing - especially as in this case it was obviously something of an item at de-briefing. Letters in numerous aircrew magazines (UK & US) requesting info on the raid were placed and despite many replies no-one knew anything. Aviation writers Martin Middlebrook and Chaz Bowyer who have written many highly detailed books about the air war, and have interviewed thousands of aircrew, wrote to say they had never heard of the incident, despite having had foo-fighters mentioned to them in other contexts. If the account wasn\'t a hoax and the government archives (all of them) were either lying or hiding material pertaining to the event the only way of proving it seemed to be getting a fresh first-hand report of the incident. Dennis Stacy contacted the 384th Bombing Group survivors association and with no account of the UFO sighting forthcoming from them (even stranger - perhaps survivors associations are in on the cover-up too), was put onto General Theodore Ross Milton who led the raid that day and went in first with the 91st Group Formation. He wrote; 'I don\'t recall seeing black discs or hearing about any strange phenomena from any of my group,' was his reply to the questions Stacy posed him. Are we really to believe that the guy who led the raid didn\'t hear anything about the phenomenon? Or is he part of the cover up too? Martin Caidin, originator of the rumour also presents problems. His book Black Thursday was first published in 1960 and yet quotes an alleged SECRET report. How did he get hold of it then and why has it not been seen since? As for Caidin himself, several people have tried to get in touch with him without success. Both myself and MUFON Journal editor Dennis Stacy have tried to track him down via his publishers and a UFO magazine he has written for, but to no avail. He last appeared in the dodgy US magazine UFO Universe where he was featured on the front page as having \'chased bogies at 20,000 feet,\' (an astonishing spectacle no doubt!), but whilst the article gave details of UFOs he\'d seen post-WWII, government film of UFOs, cover-ups, and you name it (along with mucho promotion for his many books, including UFO based novels) the Schweinfurt raid was never mentioned. Funny that, really. So unless and until Caidin himself comes out of the woodwork with the original document to which he refers, or until someone who was on the raid can verify the sighting, or until other evidence about the event comes out, the discs mentioned by Martin Caidin seem to be nothing but a rumour -- a rumour which like so many others has distorted UFO literature for many years. On a more hopeful note, if the sightings did take place the event still has no real place in ufology, especially in the way it has been used. Remember from the original account the objects were only one inch by three inches which is stretching the small alien interpretation somewhat. In an air war context I would suggest that anything which is small and metallic and in clusters is some kind of 'window' or radar deflecting device, or some other war related artefact. Caidin\'s account also mentions that pilots saw 'a mass of black debris of varying sizes' in conjunction with the discs, suggesting that they came from some explosive shell casing or damaged airplane. Note also that at least one plane was alleged to have flown through clusters of the discs 'with absolutely no effect,' suggesting that, like radar deflecting strips and their ilk, there was very little weight or mass to them. All this is pure speculation however. Finally, whilst this case is often included in `foo-fighter\' round-ups it really has no business there, being atypical of the general `foo-fighter\' morphology and behaviour. You may think I\'ve been a bit pedantic here with this case but, it is very significant and the available facts need to be made known. If people are going to talk about sightings then let\'s at least be certain they happened. If `cover-ups\' are to be invoked, let\'s see some non-anecdotal evidence. As with the other foo-fighter cover-up case from Germany (Project Uranus -- a hoax generated by French ufologist Henry Durrant to see how far it would go -- it went all over the place!), the Caidin account has been repeated ad nauseum by UFO writers each trying to use the material for their own ends without looking into the source material -- crap researchers the lot of `em! If the document Caidin alludes to turns up -- fair enough, but until then the case which launched the WWII cover-up idea seems to be on very shaky ground indeed.source and references:http://www.project1947.com/articles/arwwr.htm', 'UFO Sightings over France, 1990Fair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

He shot a photo showing 10 objects in the sky while on a hike near Santa Isabel. The man claims his picture... is the best UFO photo ever taken.It was in the hills above Santa Isabel In July of 1990 that Mike Orrell snapped a photograph that changed his life forever.'The sun was setting to the west, at about 3:30 or 4 in the afternoon,' he explained.Mike was hiking near the Inaja Memorial Picnic Grounds.'It was on this block that I set my Canon camera -- I put it on maximum zoom lens,' he said.Mike snapped a single photo of the landscape. When he got the prints back, he noticed something strange.'Soon as I saw the four-by-six picture, I saw the dots.'Ten dots in the sky. But they were so small, it was hard to make them out.'Even at this distance I could not see the objects until the photograph was enlarged,' Mike said.Mike had the photo blown up -- again and again -- until the small dots were clearly visible. There were nine objects on the left, and one on the right. They looked like they were flying, but they did not appear to have wings.'Unlike birds or planes that would have wings or appendages, these objects were uniform in density and size,' Mike said.The objects were acorn shaped and triangular, and similar to other UFO photos taken around the world, that Mike has posted on his Web site.'I have labeled this the best UFO photo ever taken, and there are other people who believe it is because the pattern I found in one of the objects is duplicated in three other separate UFO photographs,' he said.Could it be? Flying saucers over San Diego\'s East County?News 8 took Mike Orrell\'s original negative to the experts at Chrome Photo in Sorrento Mesa, and asked for their opinion.'They\'re irregularly shaped, though, sort of triangular,' one staff member said.The Chrome Photo staff took a close look at the negative. They were able to rule out dust on the lens damage to the negative, or mechanical defects with the camera.'The negative itself was intact,' staff member Dennis Reiter said. 'There was no damage, no machine type damage in the process.'Next, they put the negative through a high-resolution scanner, and blew it up on a computer screen. So, are they UFO\'s?'I would agree with him -- they are flying objects and they are unidentified,' Reiter said.The objects were actually in the sky that day, but the experts could not say for sure what they were.'If you\'re asking me if they\'re alien space craft, there\'s absolutely no indication they are alien space craft,' he added.If you\'re still skeptical about Mike Orrell and his UFO photo, his story doesn\'t end there.'I had no idea the day I was here, that right behind us is an alien rock face,' he said.That\'s right. Two weeks after mike took his UFO photo, he returned to the same spot only to find a rock formation in the shape of an alien face 15 feet from the spot where he took his photo. Mike says he knows it\'s a natural rock formation, and not made by aliens. On the other hand... his relationship with that rock is a bit unsettling.Mike says he\'s never seen another UFO since his close encounter 16 years ago. But he\'s still waiting for that day when the UFOs will come again. Orrell also has discovered other rock formations in the shape of human faces. One on El Capitan Mountain near Lakeside, and in La Jolla Cove.'

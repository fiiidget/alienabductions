1979,'April 1979, Soviet Cosmonaut Sees Close-Up of UFO  'It followed us during half of our orbit. We observed it on the light side, and when we entered the shadow side, it disappeared completely. It was an engineered structure, made from some type of metal, approximately 40 meters long with inner hulls. The object was narrow here and wider here, and inside there were openings. Some places had projections like small wings. The object stayed very close to us. We photographed it, and our photos showed it to be 25 to 29 meters away.' - Cosmonaut Victor Afanasyev commenting on a UFO sighting that occurred while en route to the Solyut 6 space station in April of 1979. Cosmonaut Adanasyev made a drawing of the space ship he witnessed from aboard the Soviet orbital vessel. (shown above)  Victor states, 'I think we are not alone, something of extraterrestrial origin has visited Earth.' The alien craft turned toward ours, followed us and flew formation 25 to 29 meters away. We photographed the metallic engineering structure that was around 40 meters long. The film was later confiscated.(Source: Rense.com & Filer\'s Files )', 'Sheriff Blinded by Light from UFO; Minnesota-1979We were contacted by researcher Guy Westcott, of UFOR, who investigated the Val Johnson case. He worked for NOAP and CCUFOS at the time of the incident, and has been kind enough to send us some great material pertaining to the case, and we offer him much thanks for this. All of the material below came from him.', 'Close-up Sighting of Structured Metallic UFO in Santa Clarita Valley, CA-1979 Date: July, 13, 1979  Sighting Location: Santa Clarita Valley, California, United States  Summary: Close up sighting of extraterrestial craft by wife and I.  Date Reported: 5/1/2005 Sighting Time: 09:00 Day/Night: Nighttime No. of Witnesses: 2 Duration: 45 seconds No. of Object(s): Single Urban or Rural: rural Size of Object(s): 75-100 feet in diameter Distance to Object(s) & Altitude: 50-75 feet Shape of Object(s): disk Color of Object(s): silver/white metallic Full Description & Details It was one warm summer Friday around 10:00 PM in the evening in California\'s Santa Clarita Valley. I was brushing the swimming pool with a long pole and attached brush so that the kids could swim the following day. The pole requires you reach up to push down. I was standing on a high platform next to and overlooking the pool and about 4 feet over the rest of the pool area. As I reached to upper end of pole, I saw a craft approaching the house from about 1-2 blocks away and from the West and heading South East. I knew right away that it was not a helicopter or plane. It seemed flatter and wider and with lights in a circumference of the main frontal area. I ran towards the house and called my family to see it. Only my wife came out. By that time it was directly over our house and pool. It was approximately 75-100 feet above us. We stood along side of the pool deck. It made no sound whatsoever, and it was at a complete stopped over us for about 40 seconds. The only motion was a slight wobble and when it moved and tilted downwards at an angle. I took this as some form of acknowledgment. During the entire time, we were frozen in disbelief. It is a strange sensation knowing that what you are seeing is not supposed and very foreign. It was like seeing a Greyhound Bus floating over your house! The craft was about 75-100 feet in diameter. It had small porthole and lights around it in the upper dome section, it was solid, metallic and shiny. There was a dome in the upper section attached to the body with no visible separation, as if it were molded as one solid craft. The under section was concave towards the center and had two rectangular shapes along side each other and the length of the concave under-section. The rectangular shapes were about 7-10 feet in width and as along as the craft\'s concave underside center. I also noticed ski like devices on the front and on each side of the front leading edge window. What caught my attention was that the devices were not in the center or the 'center of gravity' for the craft\'s length and design but very forward. The skis were S shaped with the top of the S facing forward but a design I could not replicate. Upon the craft leaning in a downward motion we could see a window or cockpit like glass that was situated in the underside, it was on the front lower edge of the round craft. The rectangular window was approximately 4 feet in height and possibly 12-15 feet in length. There was a glow of soft orange and blue lights from the inside but we could not see anyone or any controls. It remained at a forward and downward angle for about 10 seconds. We both had the sensation of being watched. As it was angled, I noticed that light was emanating from the upper section that was not facing the swimming pool lights. Thus, it seemed to generate light through skin of the craft as the lights that first attracted me faced forward and were much lower than the upper section of the craft. My wife and I did not say anything to each other during the experience but she kept saying 'oh my God' over and over again. The craft then left slowly at 30-40 MPH. I jumped on a wall around our property to continue seeing for at least 7-miles. I instructed my wife not to discuss it, to draw what she saw and then we would compare drawings. They matched, although mine had more detail and accuracy. My background include Group Propulsion Systems and later as an executive with several major computer companies. What we saw was close, real, solid, and a beautiful designed craft. I know from my aeronautical engineering background that mankind has no such technology Eyewitness-ED TOWERSWitness Background Certified in Group Propulsion Systems, Studied Aeronautical engineering, degree in business management.

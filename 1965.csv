1965,' Flying Disc Lands on Highway, Pretoria, South Africa, 09-16-65 This case was first reported by the Associated Press,  Johannesburg, S. Africa, Sept.17, 1965, and first published in the United States by NICAP. The first information was related by UFO investigator and writer Richard Hall. This case, though not heavy in detail, features a vehicle encounter, UFO landing, and physical traces, along with official secrecy.The events occurred as Constable John Lockem and Koos de Klerek were doing routine patrol on the Pretoria-Bronkhorstspruit road. It was just past midnight when to their utter amazement, the lights on their police van lit up an object ahead of them on the road. Sitting right on the highway was a disc-shaped object. The object was not anything they had seen before.With the object lit up from their headlights, it appeared to be of a copper color, and was about 30 feet in diameter. After only a few seconds, the UFO began to rise above the road, and quickly sped away,  throwing flames from double tubes of some type on the bottom. The two men must have been in awe, wondering from where the strange, unknown object had come from, and where it was going. Later as the men reported their unusual encounter, Constable Lockem stated: 'Its lift-off was quicker than anything I have ever seen.' Flames from the asphalt road had shot up into the air about 3 feet, according to the witnesses. The heat was so intense that the fire lasted for a time, even after the object had zoomed away.Further investigation indicated that parts of the road had caved in, as if from a heavy object resting on it. The gravel had been separated from the tar in an area severely burned about six feet in diameter, indicating the center underneath of the UFO. An official investigation into the incident was carried out by  Lt. Col. J.B. Brits, District Commandant of Pretoria North.In an interview for a local newspaper, Brits told reporters that the case of the UFO landing was considered 'as being of a highly secret nature and an inquiry is being conducted in top circles.' Samples of the damaged road material were taken by a scientific agency for analysis, but the results were never released to the public. Because of the location of the event, and its age, it is unlikely that more information will be forthcoming. The case remains unexplained.original report by Richard Hall Source: UFOs: A New Look (NICAP 1969); Associated Press, Johannesburg, S. Africa, Sept.17, 1965.

This sighting, which occurred on the William Butcher dairy farm near Cherry Creek, N.Y., involved three members of the Butcher family and a fourth witness.  Here is their report: At 8:20 PM, Harold Butcher, 16, was operating a milking machine in a dairy barn housing 17 cows.  A portable radio on the wall was turned to a newscast, when a sudden static-like interference drowned it out.  Then the tractor which ran the milking machine abruptly stopped.  A moment later, a Holstein bull secured outside began to bellow and pull at a steel bar to which it was chained.Young Butcher ran to a window and saw a large elliptical object near the ground, a fourth of a mile away.  A reddish vapor could be seen underneath, and he heard a steady beep-beep sound.  The UFO was on the ground only a few seconds, then it shot straight up, disappearing in low clouds.   When the other witnesses came out, after Harold Butcher phoned the house, they noticed a strange odor, also a greenish glow in the clouds where the UFO had vanished.  Meantime, it was found that the bull had bent the steel bar in his efforts to get loose.     Half an hour later, when the strange craft reappeared, circling the area, Mrs. Butcher called the State police.  Two troopers investigated, notified the AF.  Next day, Capt. James Dorsey, Operations Officer, 4621st AF Group, arrived with four AF technicians.  When they examined the ground, an odd, purplish liquid substance was discovered at several places.  Small unexplained marks, two inches wide and two inches apart, also were found, along with patches of singed grass and foliage.     After the AF team left, NICAP member Jeffrey Gow obtained samples of the purplish substance and singed foliage, and samples were studied by the Kawecki Chemical Co., whose president is a NICAP adviser.  Spectrographic analysis showed the main elements of the liquid to be aluminum, iron and silicon.  Some phosphorous was found in the weed samples, which the analyst said might cause a phosphate smell, explaining the odor.     On the night following the Cherry Creek incident, State Trooper Richard Ward, a few miles from this area, watched an object with eight circular lights in line flying twice as fast as a jet.  It emitted a faint, unfamiliar, purring sound.     Dr. Fred C. Fair and John Maxwell, of NICAP New York Subcommittee No. 2, carefully checked the Cherry Creek site and questioned the witnesses.  On the basis of present evidence, they believe the report is genuine.  Dr. Fair has confirmed that two state troopers who investigated also seem to be convinced.Animal Reaction Feature:A 3-year-old Holstein bull was secured to a steel bar outside of a dairy barn containing 17 cows. About 8:20 PM, Harold Butcher, 16, was operating the milking machine when the radio had static-like interference and the tractor motor running the milking machine cut off.  The bull made a noise “like I have never heard come from an animal before.” Harold looked out the window at the bull, which was trying to get lose, and he saw an elliptical object nearing the ground with a “beep-beep” sound about a quarter of a mile away (1320 feet). After hovering briefly on or near the ground, the object shot up into low clouds.  As the object rose, the noise pitch increased to a level approximating a sonic boom.  The cows produced only one can of milk that evening rather than the normal 2 ½ cans.  Later examination of the bar to which the bull was secured found it bent.Joan Woodward, Animal Reaction Specialist:The object was metallic-looking, football shaped, and estimated to be 50 feet long and 20 feet thick.  A reddish vapor was emitted from the bottom area and when the object rose, the red vapor shot toward the ground and bounced back toward the object. The clouds had a greenish glow where the object had vanished.  At 9 PM, the object was seen again by several people at the farm.  It now had a glowing yellow vapor trail.  The clouds still appeared to have a green glow.  State police were called and investigated and the Air Force investigated.This incident involved EM effects.  A tractor motor shut down, the barn radio and house radio had static-like interference, but a telephone between the barn and house apparently worked.  Physical traces included an odor, ground marks, a purple liquid, and grass bent over and singed.Physiological effects included Harold and his younger sister having upset stomachs, and the cows giving less than normal amounts of milk.

He had planned to spend several days there. On the night of the 14th his hunting dogs took after a deer. Later, hearing a sound like a gunshot, Flynn started up his swamp buggy and headed off in search of his dogs. One of his dogs had returned, which he had placed in its cage, and it accompanied him on his search for the others. Around 1 a.m., on Monday, March 15th, Flynn spotted something unusual that he judged to be slightly over a mile away. Whatever it was, it was hovering, shaped like a broad, upside-down cone, an estimated 200 feet in the air above some cypress trees. After a while it began flying off toward the Northeast. After some 2 to 3 minutes, it returned to the same place, and hovered again, this time for an estimated 5 minutes. Then it took off toward the Southwest at a high rate of speed. Soon, however, it returned to the same location again. At this point, Flynn was only about a quarter of a mile away, and the object seemed to come down among some trees into a small knoll. Flynn figured, up to this point, that he was observing a helicopter of some sort, but then he began to study it through a pair of binoculars and he realized that he wasn't looking at a helicopter at all. Then he began to suspect that it was some secret craft from Cape Canaveral. Flynn described the object as some 25 feet high, and twice that in its diameter. Up near the top were four tiers of two-foot-square square window-looking sections that emitted a yellowish glow. The thing was metallic, and seemed to be made of four-by-four plates that appeared to be held together with rivets. Around the base there was an orange-red illumination that seemed to cast a glow on the ground some 75 feet around its rim. Sometime later he regains consciousness. Finding himself initially blind he lays there for a long while until he recovers a small amount of vision in his left eye. By this time, the sun is shining and its Tuesday morning. Flynn gathers up his dogs and makes his way to the home of Henry Osceola, a Seminole Indian who lived there in the Everglades swamp.It isn't until noon Wednesday that Flynn returns home. He and his wife go immediately to pay a visit to ophthalmologist, Paul R. Brown. Dr. Brown finds Flynn’s vision 20/800 in his right eye, 20/60 in his left eye. He notes a slight bruise over his right brow. The left eye appeared normal, but in the right eye he could not see the retina. Flynn complained of hearing reduction and numbness in his arms and hands following the encounter. Under careful observation and treatment by Dr. Harvie J. Stipe, a physician who had known Flynn for 25 years, Flynn was treated, and soon those symptoms disappeared. On March 26, Flynn, Dr. Stipe, and two others, returned to the encounter site in the Everglades, and there found a burned circle some 72 feet across. The circle looked like it had been swept clean of leaves, twigs, limbs -- normal forest debris. Eight cypress trees were scorched from their tops down to about halfway from the ground. In October 1966, in a phone interview with Arizona physicist James E. McDonald, Flynn stated that the UFO was probably, he figured, some secret aircraft of ours, and that if he could ever prove it then somebody would pay for the good eye he used to have. In July 1996, Flynn made a rare public appearance at Port Charlotte, Florida, where he stated: “I'm waiting for the day someone turns up the truth about this thing. I hope I live that long.”Reference: The UFO Encyclopedia, The Phenomenon from the Beginning, Volume 1:A-K, by Jerome Clark. Omnigraphics, Inc., Penobscot Building, Detroit, MI 48226. 1998.

', 'UFO Landing & Aliens-Brand\'s Flats, Virginia, January 19, 1965 William Blackburn, a resident of Waynesboro, Virginia, was working at the Augusta County Archery Club off Route 250, near Brand\'s Flats, when at approximately 5:40 PM,  on January 19, 1965, he saw two objects in the sky. One of these UFOs, the smaller of the two, descended to the ground and landed approximately 18 yards from the witness. From it emerged three beings of extraordinary appearance, each about three feet high. They were dressed in clothes of the same shiny, peculiar color as the object. One had an extremely long finger on one Band. The beings\' eyes were particularly penetrating: according to the witness, 'they seemed to look through you.' As the creatures approached the witness, to within 12 yards, he froze in fright, a double-edged axe in his hand. After uttering some unintelligible sounds, the beings turned and reentered the object through a door that appeared to 'mold itself into the ship.' The object then ascended and disappeared. Following the appearance of Blackburn\'s account in the local press, the witness told of being visited by members of a government agency whom he would not identify, although he said he was told not to say anything further about his sighting. In an investigation conducted by Richard Hall and several NICAP staff members, strong evidence was found to support the witness\' report of being silenced. In spite of this, the investigators were able to secure some additional details on the sighting. The area of the reported sighting is close to Fishersville, Va., the site of another landing (but with no reported occupants) which had occurred less than a month before. source:http://www.nicap.org/newlook/section_VII.htm', ' 'UFOs,  The Eye and the Camera'Adrian Vance, a former Editor of Popular Photography, wrote the book, 'UFOs, The Eye and the Camera' that contained a series of photos similar to George Ritter\'s in Ohio. On July 5, 1965, a Barry Andersson took the photo below on the Russian River near Anchorage, Alaska at 6 AM, with his 35 mm camera of a disc shaped craft that he estimated to be 30 feet in diameter.  Adrian Vance writes, 'This picture, with a focal-plane shutter, shows that the disappearance-reappearance mechanism is one that takes place in stages, and that the object begins to appear in the new location while it is still dissolving in the old location or locations.  We use the word \'locations\' since the Andersson photograph also shows that the device can be in several places at one moment, i.e. part in one spot, part in another and so on.' (Page 41). He goes on to speculate that, 'The fact that this machine can dissolve in space and spread itself over several locations indicates that its operators have a very high degree of technology.  This picture demonstrates that the process proceeds from one side of the object to the other, and that in the interval of the Anderson photograph, 1/125 second, the object was in six places.  The fact that they have picked operating cycles that are just beyond human vision indicates that they understand the process in a war, and in terms, that I have not read about before this writing.'  (Page 49).', 'Patrol Car Illuminated by UFO, Damon, Texas, 1965The Damon, Texas sighting took a second seat to the more celebrated  Exeter, New Hampshire case  which occurred on the same date... I could find no other UFO reports on this date of any note. Could the unknown objects which were seen earlier on the same day in New Hampshire have flown southwesterly down the Eastern coast of the United States, and moved over the Texas town of Damon?After a few seconds, with the strange object hovering almost directly overhead, they fled the scene and headed toward Damon 'as fast as we could go,' making speeds of up to 110 miles per hour. McCoy kept watching the object out the rear window of the car. For 10 to 15 seconds, the UFO continued to hover above the pasture. Then it abruptly shot back in the direction from which it had come. 'After arriving at approximately its original position,' McCoy reported, 'it went straight up in the air and disappeared at 25-30 degrees above the horizon.' Back at Damon, the shaken officers calmed themselves, and then decided to go back and investigate again. This time they drove down the Damon-West Columbia road, but saw nothing. Finally they returned to the area where they had first seen the lights, and once again spied the purple light on the horizon, and again saw the smaller blue light emerge with a strange two-step motion and float upward. Fearing another close encounter, they again fled the area. Goode and McCoy continued on their shift until three or four in the morning, then stopped for breakfast at a cafe. Goode noted that his alligator bite was no longer sore, and when he unwrapped the bandage he discovered that the swelling had gone down and that the wound was nearly healed. Next day, the wound showed virtually no scarring. The deputies reported the sighting to Ellington Air Force Base, and Major Laurence Leach, Jr., arrived on September 8, 1965, to interview McCoy and Goode and take a statement. Leach\'s report to Project Blue Book headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base reflected his puzzlement. 'There is no doubt in my mind,' he said, 'that they definitely saw some unusual object or phenomenon... Both officers appeared to be intelligent, mature, level-headed persons capable of sound judgment and reasoning.'

Go to: NASA- Kecksburg documentsWhat exactly soared through the late afternoon skies of Canada, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania on December 5, 1965? Eye witnesses described the unknown object as a 'fireball,' but it seemed to be under some type of intelligent control, as it veered somewhat in Ohio toward the Quaker State. One of the first official reports of that day came from Frances Kalp, who phoned in her experience to radio station WHJB in Greensburg at 6:30 P.M. She related seeing a fiery object crash into a wooded area near her home in Westmoreland County. Kalp and her children had approached the site within a half-mile, and there they saw an odd object resembling a 'four-pointed star.' Radio station employee John Murphy immediately phoned in the report to the Pennsylvania State Police Department. The Police phoned Kalp and arranged to meet her in Kecksburg. Murphy also raced to the site of the alleged crash. He interviewed Kalp and her children for his report, while the State Police searched the woods for the crashed object. Murphy eagerly awaited the return of the searchers. When they finally completed their search, Murphy was unable to get any clear information from either Carl Metz or Paul Shipco, who headed the search. They only stated that they were calling in the Military to handle the case. Undaunted, Murphy made phone contact with Captain Dussia at State Police Headquarters in Greensburg. Murphy was instructed to visit the office to receive an official statement on the search party results. Upon arriving at headquarters, Murphy noticed that the Military had already arrived in force. Murphy was startled when he received the 'official' statement; 'The Pennsylvania State Police have made a thorough search of the woods. We are convinced that there is nothing whatsoever in the woods.' By this time, Murphy was convinced that there was a cover-up of some kind. If there was nothing in the woods, why would the Military be in force at Pennsylvania\'s Police headquarters? After turning in his report to the radio station, Murphy overheard one of the policemen involved in the search describing a 'pulsating blue light' in the forest. Murphy was told that Officer Metz and the Military were going back to the woods, and to his surprise he was given permission to join the second search. Murphy\'s excitement soon turned to disappointment when after accompanying the party to the outskirts of the woods,  he was kept from going any farther. Murphy was an eye witness to the Military sealing off the area, and banning all civilians from the scene and its immediate surroundings. The story of the crash soon made newspapers and television, and the area was quickly overflowing with people wanting to get first hand information on what could possibly be a historic event. What had actually crashed into the woods? Was it just a fragment of a comet? Or space debris reentering the Earth\'s atmosphere? If the explanation was so simple, however, why had the Military cordoned off the area? Could it have been a secret Military craft? Or something far more mysterious?It soon became common knowledge that some eager, interested civilians had made a trip into the woods before the Military gained control of the area. These few individuals were interviewed by Stan Gordon, and told an amazing story. They stated that they saw a copper-bronze colored, saucer-shaped object crashed in the woods. This craft was anywhere from 9-12 feet in length, and bore a gold band around its bottom. Some of the witnesses described writing on the craft which resembled Egyptian hieroglyphics. These few witnesses were quickly whisked away when discovered by Military personnel. Later that night, witnesses claimed that they observed a flatbed truck toting a large object, covered by a tarpaulin. Shortly after the departure of the flatbed, many of the Military personnel vacated the search area. Could this have been a craft from another world being taken down our highways? An extremely intense day of activity was followed by a quiet morning, and it seemed that what had occurred was just a dream. The Air Force concluded their investigation with the 'official' statement that a meteorite was responsible for the report of a glowing craft, and subsequent crash in the woods. The media as a whole accepted this explanation, and the matter seemed for all intent and purposes, closed. Had it not been for a 1990 television program, the Kecksburg crash would have been just another fancied report by a few overly excited witnesses. The area of Kecksburg would again become a beehive of controversy after a dramatization of the events on 'Unsolved Mysteries' in 1990. The citizens of the area seemed to be equally divided on the value of airing the segment, with some accepting the 'official' explanation, and others claiming 'cover-up.' Even before the segment aired, some protesters promoted a petition to stop the network from airing the Kecksburg story. The actual witnesses of the event prevailed, stating that the petitioner\'s list did not include any eye witnesses to the original event. Opposite sides were also taken by those officially investigating the facts of Kecksburg. After the television show ran, two new witnesses came forward. One was a USAF officer at Lockbourne AFB (near Columbus, Ohio). In the early hours of December 10, a truck arrived by the little used back gate of the base and he was ordered to patrol it. It was a flat-bed with a large tarpaulin on the surface covering a conical object. He was told to shoot anyone who tried to get too close. He was advised the truck was bound for Wright Patterson AFB, which is the reputed home of other crashed saucers. The other witness was a building contractor who was asked two days later to take a load of 6,500 special bricks to a hangar inside Wright Patterson. When he sneaked a look inside the hangar he saw a bell-shaped device, some 12 feet high sitting there. Several men wearing white anti-radiation style suits were inspecting the object. After he had been escorted out he was told that he had just seen an object that would become common knowledge in 20 years time, like Pure Garcinia Cambogia which was tested in 1998 and popular until recently. Investigator Robert Young, for one,  became an advocate of the Military\'s official explanation. Stan Gordon, on the other hand, believed the eye witness accounts, and the cover-up theory. Gordon took his findings to the next level, producing a 92 minute documentary video of his findings, titled 'Kecksburg: The Untold Story.' As to be expected, alternative theories were put forward by skeptics and debunkers, such as the reentering of the Russian VENUS probe, but this scenario was rejected by the American and Russian governments. One interesting footnote to this haunting tale came from the widow of John Murphy, who shortly after his death, publicly stated that her husband had been one of the first on the scene, and had actually photographed the strange craft. Supposedly, these valuable snapshots were confiscated by Military officers, and Murphy was instructed not to discuss what he knew, unless he wanted to suffer severe consequences.  In January 1980 UFO investigator Clark McClelland interviewed the assistant fire chief of Kecksburg, James Mayes, and Melvin Reese, another fireman. They reported that their team had come within sixty meters of the object. They had seen an object on the ground that had smashed its way through the trees. Mayes explained how the military had cordoned off the woods and had established a temporary base, complete with telecom link. Fire chief Robert Bitner would later confirm this story. He also said he had seen an object that was about 6 feet high, 6 feet wide, and some 15 feet long, clearly not an aircraft. It was resting at an angle on the ground as if it had impacted nearly horizontally. Another fire officer, \'Pete\', stated he had seen a ring of bumpers around it into which were described some pictorial symbols. In 1990, researcher Stan Gordon from the Pennsylvania Association for the Study of the Unexplained, traced an apparent first-hand witness,  James Romansky. He recalled seeing the object on the ground some 25 years previously, when he was an 18 year old fire fighter.  He had been called to duty that night following concerns that an airplane had crashed. He described the object as bronze coloured and shaped like an acorn-some 12 feet long and 25 feet in diameter;  it had slightly raised 'blunt' end and strange markings. 'It had writing on it, not like your average writing, but more like ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. It had sort of a bumper on it, like a ribbon about six to 10 inches wide, and it stood out. It was elliptical the whole way around and the writing was on this bumper.It\'s nothing like I\'ve ever seen, and I\'m an avid reader. I read a lot of books on Egypt, the Incas, Peruvians, Russians and I\'ve never to this day come across anything that looked like that.' On 08-29-05, the UFO Casebook received this information from a person who was an eyewitness to the object that soared over Kecksburg.B J, I was on some site about the Kecksburg sighting. It told the story and asked if anyone had an opinion about it. Well, I lived in Pittsburgh at the time that this occurred. Brian Vike wrote about his experience, and when I read it I was floored.  I had forgotten about this ever happening until I watched the Brian Gumbel special. Brian Vike also said he recalled the incident. His sighting and mine are so similar. I was at a drive-in movie that night with my boyfriend. He wanted to get there early to get a good spot. I can\'t remember how long after we arrived there when it happened.  All of a sudden the sky lit up. 'What the heck is that I asked?'The sphere or the ball like object was very low in the sky and was burning and had a long firey tail. The color to me had a greenish color to it. I would say it was in my view for at least 4 seconds, maybe 5 seconds. But of course in those days we thought it was only a meteor. And the next day it was confirmed on the radio it was.  After all these years that have passed it\'s truly amazing to me how much of it I can still remember. Thank you B J,  and getting this computer is wonderful. And know I can relate what I've seen, and hope what I will see in the future  I can relate them to you, and everyone else out there that is interested in the UFO phenomenon.FrancineThe Kecksburg crash, in many ways similar to the Roswell case, remains an extremely interesting one, and is still considered 'unsolved.' (B J Booth)', 'Valensole, France Landing, (Masse), 1965 In July of 1965, In Valensole, France, a farmer named Maurice Masse claimed that he saw two children standing in his field. Masse was attempting to find a solution to why his lavender crop had bare spots of ground. As Masse approached the 'children,' he noticed an unusual object close by. Now with a much closer view, the children were not children at all, but 'strange looking beings.' Masse described them as having large, bald heads, pasty faces, and huge, slanted eyes that stared out at him. He also related that they were wearing coveralls of some sort, and one of them was holding a tube-like device, standing by an odd-looking craft. Masse swore that as he approached the object,  he was hit by some sort of ray, which disabled him for a time. When he awoke, he saw the object flying off into the sky. Fearing ridicule, he was reluctant at first to report his incident, but in time, he came forward with the facts.During an interview, Maurice was shown a drawing representative of an object that had landed in Socorro, New Mexico, the previous year. The object had been seen by policeman Lonnie Zamora, who later made a sketch of it.  Masse remarked, 'Someone else has seen my UFO.' According to the farmer, he was not able to grow anything in the area of the incident for years to come. Neither the Masse nor Zamora case proves the existence of extraterrestrial life, but especially in the Zamora case, there is no doubt that some type of unusual craft with occupants did land, and take off again. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who interviewed Zamora on more than one occasion, believes every word that Zamora said, however, offers no explanation for his sighting. In Hynek\'s own words; 'There is much more evidence to indicate that we are dealing with a most real phenomenon of undetermined origin.'If what Zamora saw was not of extraterrestrial origin, then where did it come from? Why did it land? Who were the strange occupants? (B J Booth)source: Dr. J. Allen Hyneksource: www.nicap.org', ' Flying Disc Lands on Highway, Pretoria, South Africa, 09-16-65 This case was first reported by the Associated Press,  Johannesburg, S. Africa, Sept.17, 1965, and first published in the United States by NICAP. The first information was related by UFO investigator and writer Richard Hall. This case, though not heavy in detail, features a vehicle encounter, UFO landing, and physical traces, along with official secrecy.The events occurred as Constable John Lockem and Koos de Klerek were doing routine patrol on the Pretoria-Bronkhorstspruit road. It was just past midnight when to their utter amazement, the lights on their police van lit up an object ahead of them on the road. Sitting right on the highway was a disc-shaped object. The object was not anything they had seen before.With the object lit up from their headlights, it appeared to be of a copper color, and was about 30 feet in diameter. After only a few seconds, the UFO began to rise above the road, and quickly sped away,  throwing flames from double tubes of some type on the bottom. The two men must have been in awe, wondering from where the strange, unknown object had come from, and where it was going. Later as the men reported their unusual encounter, Constable Lockem stated: 'Its lift-off was quicker than anything I have ever seen.' Flames from the asphalt road had shot up into the air about 3 feet, according to the witnesses. The heat was so intense that the fire lasted for a time, even after the object had zoomed away.Further investigation indicated that parts of the road had caved in, as if from a heavy object resting on it. The gravel had been separated from the tar in an area severely burned about six feet in diameter, indicating the center underneath of the UFO. An official investigation into the incident was carried out by  Lt. Col. J.B. Brits, District Commandant of Pretoria North.In an interview for a local newspaper, Brits told reporters that the case of the UFO landing was considered 'as being of a highly secret nature and an inquiry is being conducted in top circles.' Samples of the damaged road material were taken by a scientific agency for analysis, but the results were never released to the public. Because of the location of the event, and its age, it is unlikely that more information will be forthcoming. The case remains unexplained.original report by Richard Hall Source: UFOs: A New Look (NICAP 1969); Associated Press, Johannesburg, S. Africa, Sept.17, 1965.

Broadcasting stations, police, and other agencies had been flooded with reports for hours. Television cameraman Robert Campbell was out with Patrolman Peter McCollum, interviewing witnesses and watching the objects for themselves. Campbell took a still picture of the hovering UFO[footnote 1 - a two minute time exposure while he and the police officer watched the thing. The picture was overexposed, possibly due to the brilliance of the UFO...'[footnote 2   '... I investigated \'on-location\' at Sherman, TX... was photographed by television newsman Bob Campbell... He had been monitoring police calls on his radio and he left his home at 3:00 AM, armed with a 4x5 Speed Graphic and Tri-X film, to photograph the strange light he had heard reported on the police radio... '[footnote 3   'Shortly after midnight a news photographer for a local television station, heard on his short wave radio, two police highway patrols discuss reports of an UFO tracked on radar and streaking towards the Texas border. 'The photographer took his 4x5 Speed Graphic camera and drove into town, where he met the Chief of Police. Together the two men searched for the object, and soon sighted it hanging stationary thirteen miles east of Sherman, on Highway 82. 'Its outline was clearly defined in the north-eastern sky, and the photographer set up his camera. He took four exposures, two minutes each at three-minute intervals. The negatives have been carefully examined by Air Force scientific advisers and by astronomical experts. No acceptable explanation has been found for the object recorded on the negatives. It must be considered a UFO.'[footnote 4  'The remarkable aspect of this particular incident is that, having been alerted by the same radio broadcast, several other individuals were also watching the object. Campbell and McCollum were one mile east of Bells, OK. Highway patrolman Bill Quires was watching from Durant, 30 mi north of Bells, and Department of Public Safety Dispatcher Jim Faglia was watching from a point seven miles south of Sherman, thus precluding the possibility that the object could have been a planet or a star.'[footnote 5 The object\'s shape was a cylinder with 'Mercury capsule' shape at one end, possibly rounded at other end. Several distinct bands around diameter of cylinder, with disc shaped 'bosses' on surface. Bands of luminosity. An extrusion of luminosity from one band, and an ejection of an unknown material accompanied the object.  Footnotes: 1. Actually, there are at least 2 photos.   2.

1976,'Return to UFO CASEBOOK HOME PAGEOne of the most bizarre reports of unusual phenomena occurred in 1976 in the Spanish Canary Islands. Although the case features a most extraordinary description of aliens and their craft, the occurrence is extremely reliable in that it includes multiple witness reports which agreed in all aspects of the case. The phenomenon began on the night of June 22, 1976, as residents of Tenerife, La Palma, and La Gomera began reporting the sighting of unusual lights in the sky. These lights and their maneuvers were different from anything residents of the area had seen before. Newspaper headlines the next morning proclaimed that 'thousands of people' had witnessed a 'spectacular phenomena' which lasted 'twenty minutes.' The most sensational aspect was the sighting of the aforementioned 'sphere' occupied by strange alien beings.Three days later, the Commanding General of the Canary Island Air Zone named an 'Investigative Adjutant' to make sense of the events. His findings were forwarded by a Spanish Air Force General to journalist J. J. Benitez in 1976, and the details of the case quickly reached beyond the scope of the Islands to the outside world. Benitez\'s investigation would be the basis of his book, 'UFOs: Official Documents of the Spanish Government.' The case would regain momentum in 1994, when files of the investigation were released as part of the unveiling of Spanish records, a type of 'Freedom of Information' act. The 1976 report was massive, containing over one hundred pages of testimony, evaluations, drawings, and more.The official Air Force report of the incident was headlined by depositions of fourteen witnesses. A type of standard was established with witness reliability based on social status. A doctor\'s report was considered a high priority, whereas a common laborer\'s report was given little, if any, weight. In this particular case, this unfair standard did not take away from the acceptance of the facts, since all involved were in full agreement as to what they saw. The report was very detailed, and presented chronologically.The initial report of the Canary Island UFO came from the Navy\'s armed escort ship, the 'Atrevida.' The ship was located off the coast of Fuerteventura Island. The ship\'s captain gave a detailed report of what he and his crew observed at 9:27 P.M. on June 22. The entire crew saw an extremely bright yellow-blue light moving from the shore in the direction of the ship, located three and a half miles at sea. Several of the crewmen at first thought they were seeing a conventional aircraft with its landing lights on. The lights soon faded, and a type of beam began to rotate, similar to a lighthouse effect. Afterwards, an intense halo of yellow and blue could be seen from the fantastic craft. Amazingly, the crew watched the craft for a full forty minutes. The craft seemed to be playing tricks with its lights, as they constantly changed from one form to another. Even though the light show was observed for a long period of time, no signature was evident on the ship\'s radar of any flying craft. Actual transcript-Captain of Atrevida.'At 21:27 (Z) hrs. on 22 June, we saw an intense yellowish-bluish light moving out from the shore towards our position. At first we thought it was an aircraft with its landing lights on. Then, when the light had attained a certain elevation (15 - 18 degrees), it became stationary. The original light went out and a luminous beam from it began to rotate. It remained like this for approximately two minutes. Then an intense great halo of yellowish and bluish light developed, and remained in the same position for 40 minutes, even though the original phenomenon was no longer visible.'Two minutes after the great halo, the light split into two parts, the smaller part being beneath, in the center of the luminous halo, where a blue cloud appeared and the part from which the bluish nucleus had come, vanished. The upper part began to climb in a spiral, rapid and irregular, and finally vanished. None of these movements affected the initial circular halo in any way, which remained just the same the whole time, its glow lighting up parts of the land and the ocean, from which we could deduce that the phenomenon was not very far away from us, but was close.' Only a few minutes later, this same object was seen by residents of Canary Island proper. The bulk of the sightings were by citizens of three villages; Galdar, Las Rosas, and Agaete. A cross section of professions were involved;  medical doctor, schoolteacher, farmer, taxi driver, and housewife, among others.A thorough search of records by the Investigator Adjutant determined that there were no reports of 'aerial traffic or military exercises at the time of the reports' that could possibly account for the sightings of the unknown object . The Adjutant, for the sake of clarity, divided the investigation into two different categories. One was the larger craft observed by ship crewmen and others, and the second the smaller globe with the aliens aboard. By his own admission, and consistent with human nature, the Adjutant had no problem believing the reports of the larger craft, but had reservations accepting the orb since occupants were observed which were not consistent with human beings. The Investigator General\'s last word on the subject was: 'The fact that a very strange and peculiar aerial phenomena occurred on the night of 22 June is a true and proven fact, as incredible as its behavior and conditions may seem.'The incredible account of the sphere was submitted by Doctor Francisco Padron Leon, who lived in the city of Guia. His report is the most voluminous of the entire investigation. His background was thoroughly investigated, and he was found to be an upstanding, sane professional, whose word was considered truthful. Padron had been summoned to make a house call, and commissioned a cab to take him to the location; the town of Las Rosas. As they rode along, the doctor and cab driver were engaged in light conversation. Suddenly, the car lights pointed out a slightly luminous object in the shape of a sphere. The object was either landed, or hovering just above the ground. The object was made of a totally transparent and crystalline-like material. The doctor and driver both observed stars through the sphere.The object was bluish in color, with a radius of about 100 feet. The lower part of the orb contained a platform of aluminum-like material with three consoles. At each side of the center there were two huge figures from eight to ten feet tall. They were dressed in red, and always faced each other.The beings were humanoid in shape, with large heads covered with a type of helmet. The doctor, hardly believing his own eyes, asked for confirmation from his cab driver. 'Are you seeing what I am?' he asked. The driver exclaimed, 'My God! What is that?' The cab was only a short distance from the patient\'s house, and upon arriving, the doctor observed a type of bluish smoke coming from a tube rising through the center of the object. The doctor stated:'We were talking about hunting... as we entered the last part of the road, the car lights pointed at a slightly luminous sphere that was stationary and very close to the ground, although I can\'t say for sure if it was touching it. It was made of a totally transparent and crystalline-like material, since it was possible to see through it the stars in the sky; it had an electric blue color but tenuous, without dazzling; it had a radius of about 30 m. [100 ft., and in the lower third of the sphere you could see a platform of aluminum-like color as if made of metal, and three large consoles. At each side of the center there were two huge figures of 2.50 to 3 m. [8.5 to 10 ft. tall, but no taller than 3 m. [10 ft., dressed entirely in red and facing each other in such a way that I always saw their profile.''Then I observed that some kind of bluish smoke was coming out from a semi-transparent central tube in the sphere, covering the periphery of the sphere\'s interior without leaking outside at any moment. Then the sphere began to grow and grow until it became huge like a 20-story house, but the platform and the crew remained the same size; it rose slowly and majestically and it seems I heard a very tenuous whistling.' The sphere grew to an enormous size as it began to ascend into the sky. The doctor ran into the house, and told the family about what he had seen. Running outside, they observed the orb, which was now extremely high in the sky. It reached an enormous speed, accelerating toward Tenerfie. Finally it dissolved into a smaller size, and disappeared. Another witness, a lady who was a relative of the patient, was watching television when suddenly the screen went blank, and her dogs began to bark outside. Running to a window, she saw the doctor\'s cab, and the blue sphere above it. She also noted that the sphere was transparent, with two beings inside. Shocked, she closed the windows and doors, and began to pray.There were several other sightings of a similar nature throughout the year of 1976 on the Island. The final 'official' report was ambiguous at best. The observance of the craft by all who saw it was accepted as genuine, although no 'earthly' explanation was offered for its unique look and behavior. On the other hand, although the witnesses of the smaller orb with aliens were classified as totally reliable,  the actual presence of the beings was questioned. In other words, the witnesses were telling the truth, but what they saw was too far fetched to believe. No other explanation was forthcoming on an official level, and the Canary Island phenomenon remains today as an authentic, well documented sighting of an unidentified flying craft with occupants.sources:Benítez, J.J., OVNIS: Documentos Oficiales del Gobierno Español, Barcelona, Plaza & Janes, 1977.

Bruce, who works for a major media outlet, witnessed the objects, and the jet aircraft that persued them, and who was fortunate to capture one of these objects on film.  A little background on Bruce around the time the incident took place: Bruce was working in the news department at Channel 3, the PBS station in Portales, New Mexico. In addition to working at the PBS station he held a couple of part time jobs with two of the local radio stations as well.  At that time money was an issue due to Bruce being a college student.  Working at the different media outlets it was giving him the experience he needed for his upcoming career in Journalism. One of the overnight jobs Bruce had was in Clovis, New Mexico at KMTY FM 99.1 which was at that time one of the 100 thousand watt radio stations in the country. First Night\'s Encounter With Unknown ObjectsOn January 21, 1976 Bruce received a call from the radio station manager to see if he would mind working as the station was going to do some performance checks on the transmitter. Bruce would stay out at a remote location where some of the station\'s equipment was located. This is how Bruce ended up at the right time, and the right place, to see the events that were about to unfold in front of him in the skies above. A side note to this story is that Bruce was also a storm spotter for West Texas and Eastern New Mexico. Bruce was given a small kit which held a pair of binoculars, a note pad and a bunch of telephone numbers that he could call if a storm was spotted coming through the area. Bruce had spent alot of time at Cannon Airforce Base as he was in the civil air patrol. At that time his senior flight instructor had given him his primary flight lessons. Being on the base, and not in the military, Bruce had become friends with a lot of the base personnel.  Since he worked at one of the local radio stations he would play requests that were called in from the base security and night maintenance.  He got to know them all very well. Bruce mentioned that Cannon was located between the University of Portales and Clovis and it was common to see the F-111\'s and Aardvarks taking off from the base with full afterburners carrying out nighttime flight operations.  Bruce arrived and was sitting in his truck at the location of the transmitter.  While waiting for the phone to ring in the transmitter shack he noticed a number of pin-point lights popping up in the sky which appeared to look like light-bulbs on a string.  Two of them dropped downward until they reached a lower altitude, stopped and hovered. The lights were seen between his location and the Airforce Base at this time. While watching these strange objects Bruce grabbed the pair of binoculars he had with him. He describes the two lower lights as the classic saucer shaped craft and they had a bluish glow to them with a red radiant glow on the bottom side of the craft.  A small dome shape could easily be seen at the top of each of the two objects. In his estimation he believes the objects may have been at least 30 to 50 in diameter. The two objects were hovering parallel to one another and then started to move off at a slow rate of speed in perfect formation heading towards the airforce base. Bruce said he followed them with his binoculars for approximately 15 minutes. The objects flew past a number of buildings which were at the edge of the base and they proceeded to climb in altitude as to where they again looked like a small light in the clear night sky. Bruce said it looked as if the lights on, and in, the buildings were dimming due to the objects being in close proximity. Later after talking to base personnel, this proved to be true, the lights had dimmed, and the objects were noticed by the base personnel.  Bruce usually carried a small camera with him but on this day he had not brought it with him. Bruce called the station as he was excited to talk about what he had just witnessed. Some of the other people at the station had also been watching the events unfold that night. Through Channel 3\'s connections they heard that the objects were widely seen by many that night and by the state police. An article was written on the objects seen that January.  Second Night\'s Encounter With Unknown Objects.The next evening Bruce had gathered together a few people from the newsroom. Since Bruce was staying in a dorm on campus he knew a good number of folks on campus.  He was able to get the keys for the door to the roof so Bruce and his friends could sit up on top of the building\'s roof to watch the skies just in case something should return. Although a cool night the group stood watching.  This time Bruce did bring the camera.  At approximately 12:45 a.m. four objects dropped down from the night sky and started darting around. (This is where Bruce was finally able to capture an image of one of the crafts on black and white film.)  As the people observed the objects, the Airforce Base had scrambled the F-111\'s jet fighters out of Cannon. The jet aircraft began trying to intercept the objects. As the aircraft got close to the vicinity of the unknown objects, the objects, at an incredible rate of speed, would shoot across the sky making 90 degree turns leaving the fighter aircraft trailing way behind as they just weren\'t able to keep up with the strange craft. As the objects made  unusual turns a plasma type glow could clearly be witnessed by the group of people watching the event.The cat and mouse chase between the objects and jets went on for approximately 45 minutes. Because the witnesses were on one of the tallest buildings in Portales, New Mexico, they could clearly see the flight-line at the Base. One of the men had brought a 150 power telescope which enabled the fellows to see the objects fly at a low altitude over the flight-line. As the objects passed over the lights running down the flight line, all the lights went out. Eventually the objects shot up and were gone in a second, or so, and the F-111\'s were recalled back to the Base and landed safely. Bruce told me that a couple days after the second night sighting of the objects a couple of the Base security personnel had called and explained how the lights went out over the entire base. Of course, Bruce was asking a lot of questions at this point. The security officer from the Base told Bruce that everyone at the Cannon AFB were freaking out as they did not know what these objects were. Also the security officer said that the Cannon base was bringing in new light towers from a SAC base in North Dakota to place on the flight line. The security officer told Bruce to keep an eye on the base as it would be really lit up after the new lighting was installed.  A few days later the AFB was lit up brightly. Bruce talked to another military man from the base who said that the base had radar tape of the objects from both nights but certainly did not want Bruce to mention where the information came from. Because there were others who were there who witnessed the events that took place over the Cannon Airforce Base I will be attempting to contact these witnesses to gather their reports on the event. One other important bit of information to this case is that there is a Freedom Of Information Act document to say that jet aircraft were scrambled out of the Cannon Airforce Base that evening in 1976. Although there has been no explanation as to why, this still gives us a valuable clue that something very unusual took place that night.  Update: After Bruce went public with his story on the Jeff Rense national radio program, he and his family were threatened.  Bruce called me on July 20, 2004, after he appeared on the Jeff Rense radio program with me on Friday - July 16, 2004, when he told what he saw over the Cannon Airforce Base back in January 21, 1976. Bruce told me on the air that he had taken a black and white photograph of one of the objects that had been observed out-maneuvering the jet aircraft which were scrambled from the Cannon AFB. On July 20, 2004 at approximately 1:30 a.m. Bruce had a disturbing telephone call from an unknown person and the report on this is below.  Bruce wanted to point out to me that he does carry two cell phones with him at all times. One is for business, etc.. and the other is for personal business to keep in contact with family and close friends. He stated that no one had his private cell number as it was not listed and the only people that had this number were his wife, children, and some close friends. His children are grown up and now living on their own.  Bruce kept his cell phones on the night table.  His work phone turned off, but the private phone turned on, just in case one of his children might need to contact him in case of an emergency. As I mentioned above, it was around 1:30 a.m., Bruce and his wife had turned in for the night and were sound asleep when his cell phone started ringing.  Knowing that he had his work cell phone turned off he knew it was a call from one of his children, and of course being a parent, he worried as he grabbed for the phone. Bruce answered with a hello and a voice spoke back saying, 'Mr. Bruce (last name). Bruce said there was a very professional sounding gentleman on the other end. The man said he needed to talk to him about a matter of utmost urgency! Bruce still half asleep asked the man who he was, what was this call was all about, especially at this hour of the morning. The fellow said this is about your recent radio appearance and discussion about some photographs that you took back in New Mexico.  At this point in the conversation Bruce said to the man,'you have to be kidding me,' thinking this had to be some kind of hoax, asked who was this. The man said there is no need for you to know who I am. He went on to say, 'it would be in your best interest to discontinue this line of discussion and do away with those photographs.  Destroy them!'  Bruce at this point is in shock about this man.  He looks on the cell phone to see what phone number is displayed and it shows 'number not available'. The man told Bruce that 'this is no joke and \'we\' feel that this would be in your best interest, and for the sake of your family, that all of this go away.' Bruce told the man that if he wasn\'t willing to reveal himself then the conversation would be terminated. The man then went on to tell Bruce what his children were involved in, meaning their daily activities, where they lived, etc.., what Bruce\'s wife was doing, such as personal activities within the family, etc... and said that he could fax Bruce his life\'s history within a few seconds. That was it, Bruce hung up and that ended the call with the stranger. After this incident took place and some weeks had gone by, a neighbor of Bruce\'s caught up with him outside one day and told him that they had been seeing alot of traffic in and out of Bruce\'s property. Cars would pull up and stay for a while and then drive off. Other times the cars would pull into the driveway, stop, and men would get out and walk around the home. Then they got back into their cars and drove off. These cars that were coming and going had government license plates on them. One other interesting fact to this story is that Bruce put together a package for me, Jeff Rense, George Filer and Peter Davenport. In this package there was a copy of the photo he had taken over the AFB. Bruce mailed out the packages to us all and not one of us have received the information. Bruce says he is going to try again and send it through a different means. I hope once I receive the material I can update this story.  So that is where this story stands right now.  I would like to extend my many thanks to Bruce for coming forward with his story.By Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.canadianufo.com HBCC UFO RESEARCH Newsletter At: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HBCC_UFO_Newsletter/ ', 'The Allagash AbductionThe Event: The Allagash Waterway is a series of lakes and canals in the breathtaking mountains of Maine. This lovely area would be the site of one of the most discussed and best documented alien abduction cases on record. A dramatized version was featured on the 'Unsolved Mysteries' television show. The Allagash incident would involve multiple witnesses, four to be exact, twin brothers Jack and Jim Weiner, along with their friends Chuck Rak and Charlie Foltz. The four men had met while studying at the Massachusetts College of Art, and they were all beginning their respective careers. The four artists would turn into sportsmen for what they thought would be an enjoyable, relaxing trip. Their trip to Allagash would be memorable, but not for the reasons they had hoped for.  It would be in August 1976, that the four men began their vacation, and part way through their canoeing, they reached Eagle Lake, padding to it\'s mouth to do some fishing. Not having any luck, and running low on food, they decided to try some night fishing. Before leaving the bank, they built an extremely large campfire to be a landmark light from the water. After a time on the lake, the four suddenly saw a light... a light that seemed much brighter than a star. The glowing orb was hovering over the trees a couple of hundred yards away. The object changed colors as it moved back and forth; red, then green, then a whitish yellow. The massive object was estimated to be about 80 feet in diameter. The object slowly moved across the tops of the trees along the bank, and as it came closer to the four fishermen, Charlie Foltz signaled an SOS with his flashlight. Immediately, the object silently moved toward the canoe.  A guarded curiosity now turned into a frantic dash for the bank. As they paddled as fast as they could, a hollow light came from the object, engulfing the men and their canoe. The next thing the men knew, they were standing on the bank again. Charlie pointed his flashlight toward the object again, but this time it rose up and out of their view, as it showed it\'s beam once more before disappearing into the Allagash sky. Wondering what had transpired, the men were shocked to see their once glowing fire to be nothing but smoldering ashes. This should have taken several hours, and the four friends wondered, 'What happened to the last couple of hours?'Very little was said as the four men packed up their gear and went back to the everyday grinds of their respective careers. In time the night of the UFO would begin to have a profound effect on their lives.Jack Weiner was the first to start having nightmares. In these dreams, he saw beings with long necks, and large heads. He saw the beings examining his arm, while Jim, Chuck, and Charlie sat on a nearby bench, not able to intervene. The beings had large metallic glowing eyes with no lids, and their hands were insect-like, with four fingers. The other three men were experiencing very similar dreams, with short, mental clips of that awful night on the lake. In 1988, out of curiosity, Jim Weiner attended a UFO conference hosted by Raymond Fowler. Weiner met Fowler afterwards, and related his strange encounter. The investigator was excited about Jim\'s story, especially the fact that it was a multiple witness occurrence. Fowler suggested to Jim that he and the others undergo regressive hypnosis. After the sessions, it was revealed that all four of the men had been abducted, and subjected to humiliating physical examinations, including the taking of skin and fluid samples. The men\'s description of the aliens was consistent, and being artists, they were able to make detailed sketches of the entities, the craft, and the examining instruments. Chuck Rak added that the aliens\' test area was similar to a vet\'s office, with a silvery table. He also related a strange fact: he had much difficulty in focusing on the aliens. When he tried, he could not put an exact image to them. He compared it to trying to tune in a fuzzy radio station.After the psychiatric examinations, all four of the men were deemed to be mentally stable, and they all passed lie-detector tests. All of the information gleaned from the detailed hypnotic sessions, and investigative reports provide strong evidence that something 'not of this world' was encountered by these four men on the Allagash Waterway in 1976. This case is still considered unexplainable by conventional scientific means. (Allagash The Event written by B J Booth)Aftermath:When you chat with Anthony Constantino, there\'s always one inevitablequestion: 'Do you believe them?' 'Them' is a group of four friends whowent camping on the Allagash Waterway in northern Maine in the summerof 1976. Maybe you saw them recently on the Joan Rivers Show, wherethey detailed an ordeal in which they claimed they had a closeencounter with a UFO. They are receiving national attention with therelease this summer of 'The Allagash Abductions' written by RaymondFowler of Wenham who is a director of investigations for the MutualUFO Network.Those who are familiar with this case know that the full story, withall its mysterious and harrowing details, wasn\'t revealed untilAnthony Constantino of Beverly placed the four men under hypnosis, andrevealed events that had been pushed into their unconscious.'It was the most intense experience I\'ve had as a hypnotist,' saysConstantino.The conscious part of the story begins on Thursday, August 26, 1976,when the four men - Chuck Rak, Charlie Foltz, and identical twins Jimand Jack Weiner, set up camp on Eagle Lake in Maine, and decided to gofishing in the evening.  They built a huge bonfire to act as a beaconfor their return to camp.Soon after they were out in their canoe, they saw 'a large brightsphere of colored light hovering motionless and soundless about 200 to300 feet above the southeastern rim of the cove,' according to Rak.Foltz blinked a flashlight at the object. Maybe that was a bad idea.The UFO began to approach the canoe, while a cone-shaped beam of lightfrom the object struck the water and began following the canoe. Moreinspired than any Olympic athletes, the four campers began paddlingfor shore.But the beam engulfed them, and the next thing they remembered, theywere in the canoe, near the shore of the lake, watching the UFO ascendand disappear.  The bonfire was now nothing more than embers. Builtwith heavy logs, the fire should have lasted hours. It was the firstindication that more time had elapsed than they could remember, butthey had no conscious memory of what had happened.It was years later before the four men explored that missing periodof time. When Jim Weiner suffered tempero-limbic epilepsy, hisdoctors asked him to report any unusual experiences that might besymptomatic. Weiner described his UFO experience, and variousphenomena that had happened to him and his camping buddies since then.His doctors suggested he contact a UFO researcher.Enter Anthony Constantino. A professional hypnotist from Beverly, whoalso works as an English teacher at Masconomet High School,Constantino had hypnotized Ray Fowler in 1988, helping him to rememberthe details of Fowler\'s own alleged abduction in Danvers.Fowler was leading the investigation of the Allagash abductions forthe Mutual UFO Network, and he wanted Constantino to hypnotize each ofthe four men separately.All four men were willing to participate.'It\'s natural,' says Constantino. 'They wanted to know if somethinghad happened to them -- especially if it were something traumatic.They wanted to know for sure.'In 1989, in the dark den of Constantino\'s Beverly home, each of thefour men separately recounted a tale of being beamed aboard the UFOthat night on Eagle Lake. Under hypnosis, they described the diffuselylit, sterile interior of the spacecraft, the spindly fingered big-eyedbald-headed aliens that Whitley Strieber popularized with hisnon-fiction book 'Communion,' and strange medical experimentsconducted on each man.Constantino says Fowler was cool and professional as he observed the12 hours of hypnosis sessions, but Constantino admits that at times hehad difficulty repressing his own astonishment.'I\'m the one who kept making faces at Ray, like, I can\'t believethis. I can\'t believe what was done to these guys.' Which brings us back to The Question. Constantino conductedthree-hour hypnosis sessions with each of the four men. He heard theirvoices fill with fear as they explained how medical instruments wereinserted into their bodies, and how communication from the aliens wastelepathic. Constantino says he went into the session 'with no preconceivednotions,' nothing more than a healthy curiosity about an unexplainedphenomenon.But was he convinced?'Do you believe them?' Constantino is asked.He pauses and rubs his chin, as if weighing the gravity of the question. He looks up and nods solemnly.'I do,' he says. After working with those guys, I was scared. I stillam. I think it\'s true. I think they were being tagged -- the way wetag and study sharks and bears and then release them. The men werehighly indignant that they were taken (aboard) and these things weredone to them without their permission.(Allagash Aftermath written by Alexander Stevens)This article was taken from the Arts & Leisure section of the North Shore Sundaynewspaper published in Salem, MA  dated September 12, 1993:sources:Ray Fowler, 'The Allagash Abductions.'Return to  Alien Abductions Index  Allagash Abduction, Part 2.', 'UFO Sighting - Colusa County, California, 1976Fair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

On the 19th, the Air Force of Iran began receiving calls from local citizens reporting an unusual, unidentifiable object in the skies.The Air Force duty officer called the Assistant Deputy Commnder of Operations informing him of the situation, and asking for guidance in how to handle the situation. He knew there were no planes flying at the time that could account for the strange reports.At first Yousefit thought the edgy citizens were seeing just stars or the planet Venus, but after even more inquiries, he decided to look for himself.As he checked out the unknown object, he knew immediately that it was no star. It was much larger and brighter. He made the decision to scramble an F-4 jet from Shahrokhi Air Force Base to get a closer look at the unusual object. The plane left the runway at approximately 1:30 AM to intercept the UFO.The plane sped toward the large, bright unknown which lay some 70 miles north of them. About half-way there, the plane began to experience communication problems.Instrumentation was also faulty, so the pilot dropped off course, heading back to Shahrokhi. As the F-4 changed course, instrumentation and communication was suddenly restored.Had the UFO compromised the plane's functions as it approached, and then allowed them again as the plane dropped from its course?Another F-4 left the air base, attempting to identify the UFO. As the second jet approached the UFO, they made radar contact. Crew members stated that the size of the radar return was similar to that of a 707 jet. The actual size of the object was impossible to determine visually because of the brilliance of the glowing object.The jet drew nearer to the UFO.For a time, the F-4 bridged the distance between itself and the UFO, but even flying above Mach 1, the UFO suddenly shot away from the F-4. This incredible burst of speed was confirmed by the plane's radar and also visually.The pilot of the F-4 was not able to gain any ground on the UFO, but managed to pace it as they sped through the skies.The crew of the plane would later say that the UFO had strobing lights arranged rectangularly. The lights alternated from red, blue, green, and orange in color. The plane's crew was astonished to see another, smaller object emerge from the large UFO. The plane and UFO were now flying south of Tehran.The smaller object made a bee-line to the F-4 moving at incredible speeds.Fearing for their very lives, the pilot aimed an AIM-9 missie at the approaching object, but just as he did, the weapons control panel went off line, and he lost all communication. The only course of action left was to dive to try to avoid a collision with the approaching UFO or weapon.The approaching object followed the plane into its dive briefly, but then tailed off, and returned to the larger UFO. All functions were again on line as the UFO left the jet behind.There was never an explanation for what two F-4 jets chased over the skies of Tehran.The crew members stated that the UFO moved at incredible speeds and had the ability to disable the plane's instrumentation. This is one of the best documented UFO / Plane chases on record.(written by B J Booth)'

Testimony of brother, Andrew H.

I went to Martin's house with the sole purpose of viewing the video tape of the first sighting that he had.
When we had finished, we went outside as it was a warm evening. Suddenly, the object appeared again. I didn't want to take my eyes off it, so my brother went inside for some binoculars for me so that I could have a closer look.
What I saw amazed me. It was a very bright and slow moving object which pulsed at regular intervals. We observed it for quite a while, during which time it was approached by a smaller grey object which seemed to fly past it at great speed before disappearing totally from sight.I was a little sceptical before that day, but I now know there is another world out there.
 
Kind regards, Andy H.
 
 
During the following few weeks I managed to film the object two more times and have approximately 1 to 2 hours of video. I have seen UFOs before in Holland (Where I used to live) and in Croatia (On holiday) but didn't have a camcorder until quite recently.


Lancashire has quite a rich history regarding UFOs and just recently I have on 3 separate occasions spotted a different sort of UFO which only seems to appear for a few seconds before vanishing completely... I am going to set up my camcorder to film the area of sky involved and see what develops.

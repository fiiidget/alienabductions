July, 1951-White Sands Radar Visual 


 
White Sands, New Mexico-July 14, 1951.

During the morning two radar operators at a missile tracking site caught a fast-moving object on their scope. At the same time a tracker watching a B-29 with binoculars saw a large UFO near the bomber.  Another observer sighted the UFO and, with a 35 mm camera, shot 200 feet of film. The UFO showed on the film as a round, bright spot. (The film has never been released.)
We are looking for more information on this case.

The St. Clair County Illinois Sightings of January, 2000, 1
Note: This sighting was the subject of a television program by the Discovery Channel. A large part of this program was a reconstruction video of the events by the National Institute of Discovery Science (NISD). This program was shown twice on Discovery, 11/30/00 and 12/2/00. The reconstruction was based on the following criteria.

1) A survey crew was hired to take physical measurements of all locations from the different eyewitnesses. In this way an exact series of measurements regarding the location, direction, and distance of the flying object from the observers was possible. 
2)A professional interviewer was hired who conducted face-to-face interviews with each witness at all locations. Photographs were taken of each location. 
3)A 40 watt Argon laser with steering optics was used at each location with the help of each eyewitness to take the exact flight path of the object as determined from the perspective of each eyewitness. The eyewitnesses each determined the specific placement of the laser beams. 
4)The reconstructed testimony was used to construct a series of 3D aerial grids for each location. Then a 3D CAD package was used to create a rough model of the object as seen by the different eyewitnesses. A second animation modeling software package was used to fine-tune the details. Each eyewitness was consulted on a regular basis to verify the accuracy of the computer modeling process. With multiple iterations, the modeling tools fine-tuned the recreation into a final animation. The computer-generated models were then merged with live footage so that the exact scale, size, and flight path of the object was precisely reconstructed to the satisfaction of each eyewitness.

The Phobos II Incident, January 1989

In the October 19, 1989 issue of Nature Magazine, Soviet scientists
concluded that the craft could be spinning because it was impacted.

It has long been rumored that Mars and its moon Phobos are alien
colonies. The surface of Mars is covered with strange
shapes/buildings that do not appear to be natural such as the
pyramids, square buildings, runways, etc. One structure shows the
face of a man with a helmet looking into space. It can be seen at the
National Space Science Data Center, Viking photo with catalog number
76-A-593/17384 Titled "HEAD."  Another photo is 070-A-13. There are
now eleven Viking photographs (and growing) of this obviously intelligently
constructed monument on the surface of Mars. The "HEAD" and other
artificial features such as the pyramids were combined by electrical engineer and
imaging specialist Vincent DiPietro and a Lockheed computer scientist.
The composite images seemed to show that the features
on the surface of Mars had been artificially sculpted... Just maybe, WE ARE NOT
ALONE!

Tyrone, PA-UFO Emits Beam Of Light - Is Photographed In Flight, 10-20-02  

The witness said that the pulsating effect suddenly stopped, and the beam of light went out. The observer commented, "As far as the form, I couldn't see any craft or object per se, just the bright light itself and the beam that came down from it, as it was pretty dark at the time." The object at first appeared to be circular in shape and orange-red in color. When the object stopped moving and began pulsating it seemed more oval or egg shaped. The object continued to hover in the sky, and the witness ran to his vehicle which was about 100 yards away, to get his Olympus digital camera. The witness took one photograph as the object hovered, then a second picture was obtained just as the object was beginning to move around slowly in a tight circle. As the man prepared to take a third picture, the object, "suddenly shot straight up in the air at fantastic speed and was gone from sight." 
  
The sky conditions at the time of observation were described as partly cloudy. The witness did not detect any sound, or odd smells during the sighting. The witness estimates the total incident lasted about 5 minutes or less.The witness commented that at the location where the light beam appeared to meet the ground, he estimated that he was about 1/4 mile away, or farther from the object, and that it was about 1,000 feet in altitude. The witness also mentioned that there is a large microwave relay tower at the top of the mountain, and, "the beam appeared to be hitting the ground close to the tower." The man couldn't see the exact spot where the beam hit. 
  
In closing, the witness had these comments to make. "I don't know what this thing was, but I know I've never seen anything like it before." and "If anyone else saw this object, please let me know. If for no other reason, so I can stop questioning my sanity."

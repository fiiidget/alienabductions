Airborne Ring Photographed over Salt Lake City, Utah, 2001

The report included here was originally posted on the Coast to Coast AM web site with photographs.  
On 03-01-01, A Salt Lake City truck driver was making a delivery in downtown Salt Lake City, when he became aware of a bright flash. As the driver looked for the source of this flash, he saw a ring-shaped object in the sky. Fortunately, he had a digital camera in his truck. He took several photos of the object, one immediately after the other.

The photographs (seen below) clearly show the object as a dark, ring-shaped object. Ultimately, the ring would disappear into the cloud cover. The truck driver was interviewed by Art Bell about his sighting and photographs. There were two additional witnesses to the events, one a truck driver who was driving behind the first truck. He did not wish to be interviewed, and subsequently what he saw exactly is not known.

The third witness was working on Beck St, and saw the ring-shaped object. He was later contacted, but never responded. 

More information: The primary witness and photographer of the object also related to an investigator that he took the photographs with an Aiptek pen camera. He stated that the ring did NOT appear to be smoke, and was clearly seen. This is evident from the photographs.

When looking at the photographs in sequence, the object seems to move from left to right. With the truck moving from right to left looking at the object, at least part of the object's movement could be attributed to the movement of the truck, as the driver took the photographs. 

Another interesting aspect of the photographs is seen in photos 6 and 7. There is a type of hook seen only in these two picture. What this is, is anyone's guess. The ring-shaped object is also strange in that it appears to change shape slightly from photo to photo.

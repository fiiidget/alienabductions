The Public "Roswell Incident"

GEN. RAMEY'S MEMO 
The Air Force claimed in their 1994/95 Roswell Report that a government photoanalysis lab which they refused to identify ("a national level organization") was unable to "visualize" any "details" in the Ramey memo from first generation prints and negative copies even after digitizing (computer scanning) supposedly because of "insufficient quality."  As you look at higher resolution scans readily available to civilians from similar prints, how much "truth" do you suspect was in the Air Force statement?

The Betty and Barney Hill Abduction, Part 1
The National Weather Service later tried to downplay the radar trackings: "There is no relation between the UFOs and the radar tracks," said Dean Gulezian, the weather service's area manager for Michigan. Gulezian said that although the radar did show some echoes, 
one key thing is the eyewitnesses saw these things at tree-top level, while the radar echoes were from an altitude of 10,000 feet or higher." 
(Note above where the first witnesses reported seeing something like a string of Christmas lights "way up in the sky") 

Randee Murphy and her husband, of Ada Township, observed a "huge" shape for about two minutes as it flew slowly about 100 feet over the woods outside their home. "It had four lights," she said, and "made a soft, whirring noise. It sounded like a single jet engine." 

The Michigan flap continued for several days, presumably ending on the 10th. The sightings were never adequately explained.

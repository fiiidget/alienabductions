1965, The Exeter, New Hampshire Encounters

The events at Exeter, New Hampshire were so compelling, that the case was featured in the April 5, 1966, Congressional hearing that led to the Condon investigation. The involvement of two police officers gave it an official stamp that made it a bit harder than usual to dismiss. Attempts to explain it by invoking twinkling stars and planets, advertising planes, or military operations were difficult to jive with the descriptions given. Fuller insisted this constituted "convincing evidence" that UFOs were real and extraterrestrial.

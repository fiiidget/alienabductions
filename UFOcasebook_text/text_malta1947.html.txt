June, 1947,  Near Malta, "Little people on type of submarine."


 
A USO report from MUFOR on the internet as follows:

Witnesses: Pawlu Zammit and others

Location: 20 miles S of Malta

Object: Black submarine, or other type of craft?

Sound: None

Notes: Fishermen on a boat 20 miles south of Malta were raising their nets with a catch of fish when they saw an object floating on the water's surface that looked like a black submarine. The fishermen were frightened because they thought it looked more like a monster than a submarine, so they quickly pulled in their nets and started the boat's engine. At that moment a bright light from the "submarine" lit up the whole area and "little men" began running over the deck of the object. The fishermen couldn't make out much detail from their boat but whenever the light illuminated the "little men," they could see some sort of apparatus around their waist.

When the witness was asked how tall these men were, he replied, "About the size of a 10 year old boy." After a few minutes, the "little men" entered the "submarine" which began to glow so brightly that the fishermen couldn't see the object. It then submerged.

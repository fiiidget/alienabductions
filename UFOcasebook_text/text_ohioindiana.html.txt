 Investigator Comments 




"Whatever this object was, it generated havoc throughout the campground," said the officer. "People were coming to the gate asking what it was." 

When asked if there were any animal reaction to the object, he said that all kinds of dogs were around the area but they did not behave unusual during the episode. 

Thomas said the staff in the area had been 'on edge' due to a helicopter crash around three weeks earlier 

Thomas acknowledges that he is the source for the 'helicopter' speculation. 

"As far as a a helicopter explanation was concerned, that was an assumption made by me because I was the only emergency personnel to see this," he said. not confident that this was a helicopter 

"But I'm honestly not sure what it was, I would not put any money on this being a helicopter." 

He said that he would not surprised if there were other reports on this object. He was aware of reports generated near the Oxford airport, which is directly due east of the campground. 

"Our dispatch was calling for an officer to investigate area for low flying unidentified flying object," he said, "and I think it was called in from Butler County, Ohio." 

When told that another police agency offered the possibility that this was a star cluster, he said: "this absolutely represented nothing of a star cluster."

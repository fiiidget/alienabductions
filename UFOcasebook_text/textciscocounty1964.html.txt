CHILE, June 25, 2005-- Incredible images of an alleged UFO landing in the vicinity of Ultima Esperanza in Chile's 12th region were made known only a few days ago by the  Agrupación de Investigaciones Ovniológicas de Chile (AION). 
This sequence of clips form part of an exclusive video taken in one of the world's southernmost locations and which show the vast amount of UFO manifestations in that territory, which is considered a UFO 'hotspot" by domestic ufologists.   

This video was taken on March 17, 2004 and has been in safekeeping to date by virtue of being considered one of the most interesting items of evidence in recent years in Chile. . 

AION's director, Rodrigo Fuenzalida, will present a series of new documents on UFOs in Chile and the world on July 2, at 1700 hours at the Alameda Art Thater. The most significant events have been recorded in Brazil, Chile and the United States. 

Evidence collected in Chile has also had considerable impact, ranging from the UFO photographed over Termas del Flaco to videos collected in the country's 12th region which are being subjected to analysis. "We are analyzing some interesting UFO video material taken in area which, to our understanding, has the greatest concentration of UFO incidents," notes Fuenzalida. 

The event will take place on Saturday, July 2 at Cine Arte Alameda beginning at 1700 hours. Produced by AION CHILE and  Chilecasting, coproduced by Cine Arte Alameda.

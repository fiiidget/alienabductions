The New Zealand UFO / Airplane Encounter of December, 1978


Startup then turned the plane completely around once more and the object was not visible but Wellington control maintained that its echo was still evident on radar. As the Argosy approached Christchurch, the fuel gauge went haywire but apparently this was not necessarily something unusual and they tuned in on the UFO off Banks Peninsular.  Wellington control now had the object on radar while the aircraft landed at Christchurch.  
  

At 2-15 a.m. 31st December, the aircraft set off on a return flight and very quickly two strange objects came into view. Crockett observed one of the objects through his camera and described a spinning sphere with lateral lines around it and one of the objects appeared on the aircraft's radar for four minutes.  As the aircraft approached the end of its flight, two pulsating lights were observed - one suddenly falling for about 1,000 feet before eventually stopping in a series of jerky movements.   The presence of this object was confirmed by Wellington air traffic control. 

The resultant film taken during these two flights was shown all over the world - the BBC giving it priority on the main evening news programme.  Despite the fact that the filmed events were also evident on ground based radar, sceptics were driven to extreme and strange lengths to explain the filmed evidence, including the lights from shrimp boats, top secret U.S. remote controlled planes etc. It should be noted that the Royal New Zealand Air Force was so concerned about the event that Skyhawk jet fighters had been put on full alert in order to intercept the UFOs.

 
Following the broadcasting of the film by the B.B.C. and the subsequent investigation, the Daily Telegraph (U.K. newspaper - noted for businesslike and scientific observations) remarked:
"The scientist who suggested that all (on the aircraft) were seeing Venus on a particularly bright night can be safely consigned to Bedlam (insane asylum)!

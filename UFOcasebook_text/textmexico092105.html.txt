UFO Sighting From An Airliner with photographs

MÃ©xico, September 21 2005
 
Ing. Carlos Cauich Carrillo shot a video of an unknown object that appeared to accompany the airliner in which he was a passenger for several minutes. The flight was covering the Tapachula-Mexico route on September 21, 2005.  
When interviewed, the witness states that he felt very nervous and that he felt as though "something or someone" had placed him there at the exact moment the sighting was to occur, since he was initially only filming images of the landscape as seen from the air.
 
The video was made with a Cyber Shot DSC-P32, 3.2 megapixels, and has an approximate duration of 10 seconds.
 
Upon reviewing the material, I noticed that this unidentified flying object was performing irregular movements at high speed, vanishing completely out of frame at certain moments. This confirms Ing. Cauich's notion that the alleged UFO was speeding away from the airliner and then returning.
 
This event took place at 14:15 hours as the Mexicana de Aviacion airliner flew over the state of Oaxaca's Salina Cruz region.
 
Ing. Cauich has has sightings prior to this date. His steadfastness in watching the skies and his ability to obtain UFO evidence is noteworthy.
 
As an additional piece of information, I interviewed aviation technician Alfonso Salazar Mendoza, a UFO researcher and writer, who kindly informed me that commercial airliners flying at cruising altitude achieve speeds of 800 km per hour and an altitude of 12,000 meters. This information provides an approximate estimate.

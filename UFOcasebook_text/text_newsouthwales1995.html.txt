Multiple Sightings-Central Coast, New South Wales, 1995-96

During the period from December 1995 to January 1996, a spate of UFO sightings
        had locals from the Central Coast area in New South Wales quite baffled. 

        Many witnesses reported seeing a huge shiny ball-shaped UFO which had
        lights underneath. On occasion the object would hover over various water
        sources and seemingly suck water up into the air and into the UFO.
        Despite enquiries with local airports, air traffic control and the
        airforce, Australian investigators Bryan Dickeson and Moira McGhee could
        not find an explanation for what witnesses had seen. They collected the
        reports and published them in a book entitled the Gosford Files.

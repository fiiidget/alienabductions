On October 27th, l996, Lajos Kosina was visiting his girlfriend's parents' house in the small village of  Erpatak in the county of Szabolcs-Szatmar, Hungary. 
<p>
Lajos’s girlfriend posed for one snapshot in her parents' garden and no one noticed anything unusual in the sky at the time.<p> 
Upon having the photograph developed some weeks later, Lajos was surprised to see a ‘disc-shaped’ object in the sky behind his girlfriend. <p>Although curious, they did not show the photograph in question to anyone for several months.<p>  They were not really interested in it. Eventually, via a friend of the photographer,  the photograph in question found its way to the Hungarian UFO Network (HUFON) who have conducted some preliminary research.<p> 

Further study of the photograph by HUFON revealed that the UFO was not blurred. To them, this indicated that it was either stationary or moving very slow, and was not a model being thrown through the air behind the young lady in the picture.<p> Having questioned the photographer, HUFON could find no evidence to support the idea that he may have hoaxed the photo.<p> 

HUFON researchers were left with the conclusion that this is a genuine UFO photograph, and that a real, flat, disc-shaped object, several meters in diameter, can be seen in the photo, the surface of which appears to reflect the autumn sunshine.<p>

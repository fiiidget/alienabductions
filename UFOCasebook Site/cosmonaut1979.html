"It followed us during half of our orbit. We observed it on the light side, and when we entered the shadow side, it disappeared completely. It was an engineered structure, made from some type of metal, approximately 40 meters long with inner hulls. <p>The object was narrow here and wider here, and inside there were openings. Some places had projections like small wings. The object stayed very close to us.<p> We photographed it, and our photos showed it to be 25 to 29 meters away." - Cosmonaut Victor Afanasyev commenting on a UFO sighting that occurred while en route to the Solyut 6 space station in April of 1979. <p>
Cosmonaut Adanasyev made a drawing of the space ship he 
witnessed from aboard the Soviet orbital vessel. (shown above)<p>
  
Victor states, "I think we are not alone, something of extraterrestrial origin has visited Earth." The alien craft turned toward ours, followed us and flew formation 25 to 29 meters away. <p>We photographed the metallic engineering structure that was around 40 meters long. The film was later confiscated.<p>

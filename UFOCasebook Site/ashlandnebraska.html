An extremely compelling video of an unknown flying object was recently sent to me by my good friend and UFORA member Kim Shaffer, Director of MUFON, Tennessee. The video was taken in Ashland, Nebraska on November 30, 2003.<P> The film shows a dark, oval object which makes some maneuvers that nothing I know of can make today. The report was first filed through the NUFORC, and MUFON made an investigation. Kim has been kind enough to send me the original NUFORC and MUFON reports. I have made a short clip for your viewing. (B J) <p>


The original NUFORC report goes as follows:<p>

<i>"About 12:45 PM my husband yelled for me to come outside, what I saw was shocking and disturbing a very large, dark colored disk shaped object was hovering in the sky just south of my home. The object seemed to move in all directions (swoop from side to side and upside down) at times it looked as if it were floating then it would very quickly and smoothly fly further south and then come back.<P> At one point the object seemed to be on its side with the top facing us while in that position a very bright white light came from the object. After a couple minutes the object slowly moved further up and further south, my husband ran in to get the camcorder and shot approx. 15-20 seconds of footage before the object was blocked by trees and longer in view. We have shown the footage to several people all were shocked and believe what they saw was a UFO."</i><p>

The Phobos program was an unmanned space mission consisting of two probes launched by the Soviet Union to study Mars and its moons Phobos and Deimos.<p>
Phobos 2 became a Mars orbiter and returned 38 images with a resolution of up to 40 meters. Both probes suffered from critical failures.<p>

Phobos 1 and 2 were of a new spacecraft design, succeeding the type used in the Venera planetary missions of 1975-1985, last used during the Vega 1 and Vega 2 missions to comet Halley.<p>

Phobos 1 was launched on July 7, 1988 and Phobos 2 on July 12, 1988, each aboard a Proton-K rocket. They each had a mass of 2600 kg (6220 kg with orbital insertion hardware attached).<p>

The program featured co-operation from 14 other nations including Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, France, West Germany, and the United States (who contributed the use of its Deep Space Network for tracking the twin spacecraft).<p>

Phobos ll arrived in January 1989 and entered an orbit around Mars as
the first phase towards its real destination, a small Martian moon
called Phobos.<p> The mission was flawless until the craft aligned itself
with the moon.<p> On March 28, 1989 an elliptical object was detected
moving towards the satellite seconds before it failed. <p>All indications
were that the elliptical object had attacked the satellite which was
now dead and left spinning out of control.<p>

<P>On March 28, 1989 Tass, the official Soviet news agency stated:<p>
"Phobos II failed to communicate with Earth as scheduled after
completing an operation yesterday around the Martian moon Phobos.
Scientists at mission control have been unable to establish stable
radio contact."

But the next day a top official of the Soviet Space Agency
(Glavkosmos) said: "Phobos II is 99% lost for good." <p> It is important
to note that he stated the entire satellite was gone and not just
contact with it.
<p>
Of great interest to Ufologists was an image captured either on, or above the surface of Mars. Commonly called the shadow, whatever caused this has never been determined. If it was indeed a craft, it was of immense size.<p>
On March 31, 1989, headlines dispatched by the Moscow
correspondents of the European News Agency (EFE) stated:<p> "Phobos 2
Captured Strange Photos of Mars Before Losing Contact With Its Base."<p>
Vremya revealed yesterday that the space probe Phobos II, which was
orbiting above Mars when Soviet scientists lost contact with it on
Monday, had photographed an UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT on the Martian surface
seconds before losing contact."<p>  Scientists described the UNIDENTIFIED
OBJECT as a thin ellipse 20 KILOMETERS LONG!<p> It was further stated
that the photos could not be an illusion because it was captured by 2
different color cameras as well as cameras taking infrared shots.

<P>One controller at the Kaliningrad control center concluded that the
probe was now spinning out of control. It would seem that something
struck or shot the Phobos II Probe.

<P>In the October 19, 1989 issue of Nature Magazine, Soviet scientists
concluded that the craft could be spinning because it was impacted.

<P>It has long been rumored that Mars and its moon Phobos are alien
colonies. The surface of Mars is covered with strange
shapes/buildings that do not appear to be natural such as the
pyramids, square buildings, runways, etc.<p> One structure shows the
face of a man with a helmet looking into space. It can be seen at the
National Space Science Data Center, Viking photo with catalog number
76-A-593/17384 Titled "HEAD." <p> Another photo is 070-A-13. There are
now eleven Viking photographs (and growing) of this obviously intelligently
constructed monument on the surface of Mars. <p>The "HEAD" and other
artificial features such as the pyramids were combined by electrical engineer and
imaging specialist Vincent DiPietro and a Lockheed computer scientist.<p>
The composite images seemed to show that the features
on the surface of Mars had been artificially sculpted... Just maybe, WE ARE NOT
ALONE!

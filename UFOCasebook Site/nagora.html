On May 23, 1971 at about 12:30 P M, one of the most convincing photographs of a UFO was taken by one Rudi Nagora, a Munich musician. Nagora, along with his wife,  were vacationing near St. Lorenzen, Styria, Austria.<p>

After finding a suitable place to park his car, Nagora left his wife inside the vehicle while he scouted the general area before the two of them ventured out. <p>Suddenly, he heard a "whizzing" sound coming from above. Looking up, he could clearly see a shining, silver disc which was between him and the cloud plane. <p>The object was moving in a zig-zag pattern. He ran back to  his car, told his wife what he had seen, and grabbed his camera.<p>

Pointing his Agfa-Click camera at the object, he took a full roll of 12 exposures, capturing several stunning images. Now out of film, Nagora could see the object come even closer, and then shoot straight up, disappearing through the clouds.<p>

After the approximately 5 minute sighting and film taking session, Nagora took his film back to Munich. <p>UFO researcher Engineer Adolf Geigenthaler heard about the photographs, and began an investigation into the sighting. After careful examination, Nagoras photos were deemed legitimate by several reliable experts. <p>The photos have never been debunked, and still testify today that we are not alone.<p>

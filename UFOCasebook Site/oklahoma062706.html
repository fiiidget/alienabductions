FLAGLER -- On June 27, 2006, five of our grandchildren were fishing in our pond about 3:00 p.m., when they saw a big splash on one side of the pond. Everything became still, and the pond became like glass as the object sank. <p>Then they saw a whirlpool in the pond about 8 to 10 feet across that moved very fast across the pond towards them. When it hit the water there was steam that went up from the object then the object disappeared to reappear in another area. <p>

One of the children got on a boat that was at the bank, and she could see lights around the sides and the object looked like metal. Two other children said they saw the lights, but two of them said it looked yellow under the water. <p>

Two were still watching it when they saw the water and grass around the pond next to them start to move violently, so they got scared and ran to the house. They were very disturbed by what they saw, and it took three hours before they would tell us what had happened. They range from 7 to 13 years old and all had the same story. <p>

The next day we drove around and found truck like tracks that led towards the pond, but stopped before they got to the pond. There was a circle where the grass had been bent down in an arc shape at the edge of the pond as it splashed into the pond. <p>They said there was a cloud over them that was swirling. The older children thought it might be a tornado that sounded like a muffled lawn mower. I asked the OSU Extension Agency to check for contamination. They informed me there had been two other similar incidents.

1952 - Warrant Officer D.C. Newhouse, USN, obtained 16 mm color movies of
a group of UFOs which he and his wife observed visually near Tremonton,
Utah. At relatively close range, UFOs appeared flat and circular "shaped
like two saucers, one inverted on top of the other."<p> Mr. Newhouse unpacked
his Bell and Howell Automaster camera, with 3-inch telephoto lens, from
the trunk of his car and obtained about 1200 frames of the UFOs on Daylight
Kodachrome film.<p> During the filming, Mr. Newhouse changed the iris stop
of the camera from f/8 to f/16. The film was submitted to Navy authorities,
who forwarded it to the Air Force at ATIC in Dayton, Ohio, where it was
studied for several months.<p> According to Mr. Newhouse, frames of the movie
showing a single UFO moving away over the horizon (hence providing some
ranging information) were missing when the film was returned.<p> The hypothesis
that the objects were out of focus sea gulls was considered by the Air
Force, but could neither be confirmed nor denied. The report of Photogrammetric
analysis by Dr. Robert M.L. Baker, Jr., Douglas Aircraft Corporation (which
included a study of the 1950 Montana film) also examined this possibility.
He states: <p>"The motion of the objects is not exactly what one would expect
from a flock of soaring birds, not the slightest indication of a decrease
in brightness due to periodic turning with the wind or flapping."<p> Dr.
Baker reports that no definite conclusion could be reached, but "the evidence
remains rather contradictory and no single hypothesis of a natural phenomenon
yet suggested seems to completely account for the UFO involved."&nbsp;

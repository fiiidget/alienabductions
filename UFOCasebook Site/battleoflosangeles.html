<b>The Battle of Los Angeles, Part 1</b><p>

Case and point: A UFO event of mass proportion: a giant Alien spaceship 
hovering over one of our major cities, threatening our very existence. A 
scenario from "War of the Worlds," "Independence Day," or "The Day the 
Earth Stood Still"? <p>NO! it is NOT science fiction, it has ALREADY happened. 
When? February 25th, 1942 in the Los Angeles area.  <p>

Many believe that the "beginning" of the UFO era was in 1947, when 
Kenneth Arnold sighted flying disc-like objects over Mt. Rainier, coining 
the phrase "flying saucers." This term was already common military 
jargon by the time of the Roswell event of the same year. <p>Preceding these 
landmark UFO events was the mass sighting of a large flying disc in the 
Los Angeles area in February 25th, 1942. <p>Coming at a time of heightened 
security and anxiety following the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor only 
a few months before, this invasion would become a major UFO event, and 
possibly an omen of things to come. In Ufology, this is commonly referred 
to as:<p>

The Battle of Los Angeles<p>

The early morning hours of 2-25-42 would bring the first alerts of an invasion. Naturally, the first thought in the minds of everyone was that another wave of Japanese planes was attacking America on its own soil. Citizens of Culver 
City and Santa Monica would be the first to witness the surreal sight of a giant unknown object hovering over the suburban areas of Los Angeles. <p>

Immediately, an air raid siren shattered the peaceful sleep of the residents, 
and volunteer Air Raid Wardens grabbed their gear, and headed to the streets,
affecting a total blackout.  <p>Army's 37th Coast Artillery Brigade swung into action, lighting up the clear, black skies with their massive spotlights. What they saw 
was beyond belief. With the Japanese planes still flying in their nightmares, 
another menacing flying machine was now right on top of them.<p>


In a matter of a few short minutes, the entire southern area of California was
looking to the skies, watching the intense spotlight beams converging on the
giant invading UFO. The 37th's anti-aircraft guns helped light up the night, 
firing volley after volley at the large craft. <p>Many eyewitness reports would 
state that the large object took many direct hits, but appeared undamaged.
The 30+ minute barrage would send fragmented shells over homes, 
businesses, and citizens. In the aftermath six individuals were found 
dead from the spent and fragmented artillery shells.<p>

It was reported that hundreds upon hundreds of rounds were fired at the giant
UFO, yet it appeared unaffected. Eyewitness accounts described the object as
a "surreal, hanging, magic lantern." The object was especially visible as it
hovered over the MGM studios in Culver City. <p>There are a number of newspaper
articles of this event, and an astonishingly clear picture of the object as it
was under its heaviest attack. The object eventually made its way over Long 
Beach, before it silently disappeared from view. The cannons were now silent.<p>

Some of the most intriguing testimony of the UFO comes from a woman 
who was a volunteer Air Raid Warden. She lived like many others, in fear 
of another Japanese attack. <p>Nothing, however, could prepare her for what 
she so clearly witnessed the night of the giant UFO. Shaken awake by a call 
from her supervisor, she was briefed on the situation. Living not far from
Santa Monica, she was told the object was close enough for her to see
from her window. <p>Peeking out of her window, she was shocked at the sight
of the massive UFO above. She described the sight as follows:<p>
<Img align="left" Src="http://ufocasebook.com/californianewspaper.jpg" width="400" height="206" hspace="10" alt="Los Angeles Times Headline">

 "It was huge! It was just enormous! And it was practically right over my 
house. I had never seen anything like it in my life!" she said. <p>"It was just hovering there in the sky and hardly moving at all." <p>


"It was a lovely pale orange and about the most beautiful thing you've ever 
seen. I could see it perfectly because it was very close. It was big!" <p>

  
"They sent fighter planes up and I watched them in groups approach it and 
then turn away. There were shooting at it but it didn't seem to matter."<p>


"It was like the Fourth of July, but much louder. They were firing like crazy but they couldn't touch it."<p>


"I'll never forget what a magnificent sight it was. Just marvelous. And what a gorgeous color!" she said <p>



As the giant UFO moved away, things began to get back to normal, as 
normal as things could get, considering the times. The military clampdown
on Japanese citizens, and security restrictions on its native populace made
this an unusual time. <p>Had it not been for America being at war, news of
this event would have gained more momentum. The lesson to be learned
from this is simply that we must be ready at all times to defend our country,
and our globe from any invading force that would take our freedom as we know
it from us. <p>

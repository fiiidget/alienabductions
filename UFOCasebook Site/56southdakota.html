The Bismarck Tribune; Friday, November 16, 1956. <p>
REDFIELD, S.D. -- A young truck driver who said he "never held any stock in flying saucer stories" told Wednesday of seeing a huge object in the sky that changed colors and moved with tremendous speed. 
  <p>
Others, including three newspapermen, also reported seeing the object at great distance. 
  <p>
Marlen Hewitt, driver for a dairy here, told this story of wacthing the object as he drove a tank truck from Pelican Rapids, Minn., to Redfield: 
  <p>
"It was about 1:15 when I first spotted it as I drove along. At first I thought it was a star, I've never seen a star that bright. There were other stars out at the time, and only a few high clouds in the sky. 
  <p>
"As I went on down the road toward Graceville, it changed colors a couple of times. Near Graceville, it changed colors four times. 
 <p> 
"I thought my eyes were playing tricks with me. I stopped, turned off the lights and got out of the truck to stretch my legs. As I rounded the back of the truck, this thing swooped down about a half mile to the east of me and stopped about 1,000 feet up. 
  <p>
"I was very frightened -- I was terrified. 
  <p>
"If it had been on the ground, it would have covered about a square block. It looked to be about 12 feet thick. It was a slate gray color, and from the distance looked like it was metal. It was round, and at the base was an opening about 1/10th the size of the object from which a very brilliant light was shining. 
  <p>
"It would tilt around and back and forth, gaining maybe 3,000 or 4,000 feet in the flick of any eye. 
 <p> 
"Around the edge of this thing was a lighted outline. I couldn't tell if there were windows in the lighted part or if there was exhaust coming out all around it. 
  <p>
"It would change colors from a blue-white to orange to red. I wanted to get out of there, so I jumped back into the truck and turned on the lights. 
  <p>
"When my lights went on, the thing turned a bright cherry red and shot up into the high clouds. It moved faster than anything I ever saw. 
  <p>
"As I drove toward Ortonville, it dropped down and went to the southwest at a tremendous rate of speed. Then it stopped and hovered. 
 <p> 
"I could still see the light in the cloud when I got to Ortonville, and some editors who were going hunting came out of an eating place and watched it with me. 
  <p>
"After I got to Big Stone City, it came down out of the clouds again, further away but still changing colors." 
  <p>
Hewitt said the object disappeared about five hours after he had first spotted the bright light in the sky. He had traveled about 150 miles in the meantime. 
  <p>
He said the roads were "very deserted" at the time and that as far as he knew the only others to see the object were those at Ortonville. 
 <p> 
Hewitt said the object mde no noise. He added there was a little wind at the time the object was at its lowest level and it seemed to move into and away from the wind with equal speed. 
  <p>
Among the hunters who saw the object at Ortonville were three newspapermen, Lem Kaercher of the Ortonville Independent and Don and Dick Olson of the Marshall Messenger.

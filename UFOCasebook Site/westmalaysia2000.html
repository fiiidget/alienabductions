TANAH MERAH, KELANTAN: A large object emitting rays of light was reported to have landed on a piece of marshland here three days ago, holding some 1,000 people of Kampung Gobek in a state of high suspense. 
 <p> 
The residents said yesterday they saw the shining object land at 3am. 
 <p> 
"The lights from the object came in intervals, similar to lightning, but there was no sign of rain," Mohamad Mat Diah, 51, said. 
 <p> 
"The light from the object was very bright and the rays bathed the inside of my house. 
 <p> 
"I suspected something was happening outside and looked out and saw the object hovering over the marshland for several minutes," he added. 
 <p> 
Mohamad said at daybreak he went over to the area some 100m from his house and saw a 'Y' shaped depression measuring 15m by 5m which could have been caused by the unidentified flying object (UFO). 
 <p> 
Near the depression was another crescent shaped 3m deep hollow and three holes, one metre apart and each one metre in diameter, he said. 
 <p> 
"I was accompanied to the area by two others who initially were afraid to come with me," he said. 
  <p>
Another resident Saupi Salleh, 28, said he was awakened by the bright light. 
  <p>
"I clearly saw the light from the object," he said. 
  <p>
"I thought it was lightning but when it prevailed I realised it was something else." 
 <p> 
He went to see the depression and concluded it must have been a heavy object. 
 <p> 
Many residents were seen inspecting the landing site of the UFO.--Bernama

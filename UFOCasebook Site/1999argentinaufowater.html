<p>
Argentina: A UFO Stole Water from a Military Base in Santa Fe. An effort was made to conceal the case for years, but the proof is undeniable
<p>
The case emerges 11 years later and makes manifest the strange repetition of events related to Ufology that are intentionally concealed from the public. The episode occurred on the evening of 24 November 1999 at an army base located in the provincial capital of Santa Fe. A strange “imprint” appeared on the ground. <p>The official story suggested a gag among army officers, but research showed that several witnesses directly observed the presence of a 40-meter-long flying object. But that isn't all, because no one was able to explain the reason why the water tank and two water cisterns that supply the troops were left completely empty.
<p>
The exciting story of the event and its subsequent investigation was made known by Grupo Vision OVNI resulting from field work by experts Luis Brussa (general research), Ariel Maderna (photography) and engineer Fabian Rossi (calculation and diagrams).
<p>
“After having learned of the event, I decided to go to the base to carry out investigations. Ten days had elapsed. I invited two researcher friends – Ariel and Fabian – to come along. So we grabbed our gear and went out to conduct field research, which is unquestionably the most pleasant and interesting aspect,” says Brussa regarding the origin of the event.
<p>
A Search for Truth
<p>
“Upon arrival, we were greeted by two soldiers. We told them that we were researchers of the subject and wanted to carry out some studies. They whisked us off to a superior officer, to whom we had to explain matters in greater depth, why we were doing it and what we would do with our conclusions. Permission was granted,” states the researcher.
<p>
He later explained that “the soldiers themselves led us to the impression, located in the remotest area of the base, which covers six blocks. We started by looking at the imprint and other facilities, such as sheds, the water tank, trees, wires and the cistern, which supplies water and has a depth of 15 meters and a diameter of 2.5 meters.”
<p>
The first clue emerges here. According to the story that Sgt. Carlos Villano told the researchers, “the cistern was practically drained the night of the event.” The officer also stated that the morning following the event, the principal of the primary school that operates on the base’s premises called him to report a lack of water in the school’s rest rooms. “I was sent to the cistern to see what was going on, thinking that the fuses had blown, but they were fine,” said the officer. At the same time, he found that the cistern and tank were both out of water, while noticing the circular impression for the first time.
<p>
Direct Witnesses
<p>
Another witness was Claudio Chena, the water basin’s custodian, who was 25 at the time. “He said that he was a professional photographer and showed us pictures taken of the event. He also explained that he was playing soccer with his cousin in the base’s soccer pitch, which is in the front of the base, facing Avenida Freyre,” comments Brussa.
<p>
“Claudio said that after 9:00 p.m., they saw a bright light toward the water tank, and that the lights went out throughout the district, but not the street lamps, which remained on. They paid little mind to the situation, thinking the lights were from a truck driving along Calle San José, behind the district,” states Brussa in his account.
<p>
The researchers canvassed the base’s neighbors, and came across Marta. “This woman said that on that evening, they were watching TV with the family and suddenly became aware of a persistent, even buzzing sound, a sensation similar to that of an earthquake, which Marta had felt in Córdoba, and she compared it as being alike. She stated that the TV set and the household lights experienced at least two brownouts, although power was not entirely lost,” says Brussa.
<p>
Another key witness was Aidé, who already knew of the imprint. Aidé is Colombian and is married to a renowned rural doctor. Her son is an architect. On the night of the event, she was standing in the doorway facing Calle Salta around 8:45 p.m. when she saw “a light having a circular shape, with a luminosity similar to that of a fluorescent bulb, and it flew at low speed. <p>The treetops concealed it. It didn't give off sparks or lights, smoke or any wake at all. It didn't change shape, nor did it blink or explode, or even accelerate. It just moved on a fixed course, maintaining its brilliant light and shape.”
<p>
“She only saw a single object, which in her estimation, was between 30 and 40 meters wide and at a distance of some 150 to 200 meters. She added that at that time se felt a sense of tranquility and total silence during the approximately 12 second duration of the event,” states Brussa’s report.
<p>
Characteristics of the Imprint Found at the Base
<p>
Shape: Circular. Measurement: 5.30 meters: Interior: 1.2 meters. Characteristics: the inner print was not perfect. The external print presented a shape with hexagonal edges, not very defined, toward the south. Organic vegetable matter: grass. Size: 3 to 4 cm. tall.<p>
Color: Natural green at the center of the print; dark brown within the print itself. The virgin soil surrounding the grass was similar to that at the center of the print, natural green and regular height. <p>Complementary Data: The print was seven meters distant from the water tank. Ten meters away on the left is a shed containing two water cisterns which provide water to the tank. Water comes from the street network and fills both cisterns. <p>An electrical pump sends water to the high concrete tank. Water was missing from the cisterns the day after the event. They [the cisterns] have a diameter of 2.5 meters and a depth of 15 meters. The cistern panel connected to the electric pump did not short-circuit.
<p>

Barely noticeable in one of the 1947 photos and clutched in Gen. Ramey's left hand is a slip of paper (boxed in red).  Probably unwittingly, Gen. Ramey had the text side facing towards the camera, allowing the text on this paper to be photographed. <p> 


When blown up and analyzed, it tells a remarkably different story of events from the one Ramey or contemporary Air Force counter-intelligence wants you to believe.<p>

The message turns out to be a telegram from Gen. Ramey to the Pentagon and 
Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg, the acting AAF Chief of Staff at the time.  Ramey is providing Vandenberg an update on the very fluid situation in-the-field at Roswell.  <p>


The first paragraph describes what had been found.  Ramey starts by acknowledging "THAT A 'DISK' IS NEXT NEW FIND." He then adds that  
"THE VICTIMS OF THE WRECK" and something else (possibly just "A WRECK") had also been found near the recovery "OPERATION AT THE 'RANCH'."  At the end it states that "YOU" (i.e. Gen. Vandenberg) had ordered the "victims" and/or the wreckage "FORWARDED" to "FORT WORTH, TEX."<p>


In the second paragraph, Ramey describes how the situation was being handled.  Ramey first states that something "IN THE 'DISC'", probably the bodies of the "forwarded" "victims"  (and possibly termed "AVIATORS") would be flown by a B-29 Special Transport or C-47 to the "A1" (personnel director) of some "8TH ARMY****" division, most likely the head flight surgeon at Fort Worth given the context.  Wright Field, Ohio, home of the AAF's aeronautical labs, was to assess the Roswell crash object  (possibly referred to as an "AIRFOIL").<p>


Finally Ramey outlines how the situation was being treated publicly and how they were going to cover it up.  First he assures Vandenberg that the earlier highly inflammatory Roswell base press release (referred to as the "MISSTATE MEANING OF STORY") was the work of an Army counter-intelligence team ("CIC/TEAM"), but that the "NEXT SENT OUT PR" (Press Release) would be 
"OF WEATHER BALLOONS." <p> Ramey finishes with the statement that the  weather balloon story might be better accepted if they also added weather balloon radar target demonstrations.  This apparently was the impetus for the national debunking campaign  using the devices that followed over the next few days.<p>

There is no question that Ramey's message, even when greatly enlarged and then enhanced by computer, is a very difficult read because of fuzziness, film grain noise, uneven development, photo defects, paper folds and tilt, shadows, and text obscured at the left margin by Gen. Ramey's thumb.<p>


This will inevitably prompt comments from die-hard skeptics that a full "take" on the Ramey message is strictly one's own interpretation.


However, there are various keywords and phrases that can be readily seen by anyone, even in lower resolution scans of the message first analyzed in 1999 by a number of people.  These keywords and phrases unambiguously prove that there is no truth whatsoever to the various Air Force "explanations," be they the original 1947 "weather balloon" story, or the Air Forces updated "Mogul balloon" and "crash dummies."<p>


Far and away the most important word of the entire message is "VICTIMS" on the third line (part of phrase "THE VICTIMS OF THE WRECK").  If there were "VICTIMS", then this was no Mogul balloon crash.  As the Air Force Roswell report itself noted (using splendid circular reasoning) reports of bodies being recovered couldn't be true because the crash was of a Mogul balloon, which had "no 'alien' passengers therein."<p>


Of course Ramey's mention of "VICTIMS" in 1947 also disproves the already preposterous "crash dummies" theory.  The only way these 1950's crash dummies could be "victims" is if they also time-warped back to 1947.<p>


Another easily seen keyword and phrase is "DISC" and "IN THE 'DISC" on the fifth line.  Ramey is clearly describing the crash object as a "DISC", not as a "weather balloon", or a "Mogul" or a "radar target" or a "RAWIN" (jargon term for a radar wind target), or any other word or phase that in any way suggests some sort of balloon or balloon paraphenalia.  In fact, the only mention of "weather balloons" and "RAWIN" targets comes at the very end of the message in the context of issued public statements and damage-control.<p>


(The word "DISK" is also used on the first line in reference to what had been found, but this  instance of the word is not so easily seen.) <p>


Furthermore, the message refers to the subsequent shipment of something 
"IN the disc."  Neither balloons nor the two-dimensional, flimsy radar kites had anything "inside" that could be shipped.  If Ramey had been referring to some  piece of balloon payload equipment, then the phrase should have begun with "attached to" or "suspended from", or  "with", etc.  


In speaking of "THE VICTIMS OF THE WRECK",, using the word "DISC" for the crash object, and shipping something "IN THE DISC", Ramey is clearly referring to something other than a balloon crash.  The simplest interpretation is to take the words literally.  There is no reason for Gen. Ramey to be describing events abstractly in a secret communication to his superiors.  This was the actually crash of a so-called "flying disk" craft with a dead crew found on the inside, as corroborated by the testimony of military and civilian witnesses.<p>

Ramey is quite explicit about the existence of bodies and the crash object being a "disc."  The only thing not made explicit in the message is the exact nature of the bodies or "disc."  Ramey probably does not refer to the bodies as "nonhuman," "alien," or some similar term.  Nor does he use terms like "spaceship," "craft of unknown origin," etc. to describe the "disc."<p>


Among the theories about the Roswell incident is that this was the crash of some highly secretive government experimental craft piloted by a human crew. However, nobody has ever presented evidence that such an experimental disk-like craft ever existed  or was tested in New Mexico at that time.  It also seems highly unlikely that even a highly secret craft but with half-century-old technology would still be kept secret. <p> 


Further, it makes no sense that the government would be completely unaware of the crash of one of their own craft until some sheep rancher came into town to report it.<p>


The same logic applies to the crash of something more conventional, such as a bomber carrying nuclear weapons (another theory sometimes proposed).  The military would not wait for a local rancher to tell them about it nor would there be any need for continued secrecy into the present day.  (Similar nuclear accidents have been declassified and are now in the public record.)  And why would Gen. Ramey call it a "disc"?<p>


Finally, both the Air Force and General Accounting Office (investigating on behalf of Congressman Schiff) in 1995 reported that air crash records revealed no plane crashes in that area during that time frame that could possibly explain the Roswell incident.  In brief, there is simply no evidence for the crash of any conventional or experimental aircraft.<p>

Roswell Case Overview <p>
The Public "Roswell Incident"<p>

GEN. RAMEY'S MEMO <p>
The Air Force claimed in their 1994/95 Roswell Report that a government photoanalysis lab which they refused to identify ("a national level organization") was unable to "visualize" any "details" in the Ramey memo from first generation prints and negative copies even after digitizing (computer scanning) supposedly because of "insufficient quality."  As you look at higher resolution scans readily available to civilians from similar prints, how much "truth" do you suspect was in the Air Force statement? <p>

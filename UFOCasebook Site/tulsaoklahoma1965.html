Tulsa, Oklahoma; August 3, 1965. The Tulsa Oklahoma photographic case is an extremely interesting one in that we have one excellent photograph of a multi-colored object which fails to resemble any known flying object, past or present. The events leading to the taking of the picture were as follows:<p>
At about 1:30 AM, Mr. A. L. Smith, accompanied by his 14 year old son Alan, and three other witnesses , were captivated with watching an unusual, multi-colored UFO. Mr. Smith was a turbine engine specialist, working with American Airlines.<p>
The unknown object seemed to be slowly moving toward the five witnesses. Still some several hundred yards away, it paused briefly and hovered. <p>At that precise moment, Alan snapped a photograph with his inexpensive camera, using ASA 64 film. Alan decided not to try for a second shot. He took his camera inside the house, and ran back outside just in time to see the object rapidly flying away into the night sky.<p> His picture was extensively analyzed, pronounced authentic, and later published by Life magazine and many newspapers.<p>

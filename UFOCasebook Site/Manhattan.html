<b> The Manhattan Abduction (Linda Cortile Napolitano)</b>
</font>

<font><font color="white">
An extremely compelling and controversial case of alien abduction is that of
 Linda Napolitano, (originally aliased as Cortile) which was researched by the well-known and respected Budd Hopkins. Napolitano  claimed that she was abducted by the so-called "greys," who floated her from a closed bedroom window into a hovering UFO. The craft was waiting for her above a Manhattan apartment building at about 3:00 A.M. November 30, 1989. Linda's experience, though intriguing, was hampered at first by memory loss. She could recall only bits and pieces of the abduction. She could remember vividly the actual kidnapping and the room where she was examined, but the transportation process itself was totally lost to her.
 Further details of the case would be forthcoming via the passage of time, other witness statements, and through regressive hypnosis. <p>

Hopkins, as to be expected, has been ridiculed by many of his peers, but has been steadfast in searching out the consistent, underlying themes that run through alien abduction cases. Napolitano's case is remarkable and unique in itself, although following the general abduction pattern on some points. More than a year after Cortile's experience, Hopkins received mail correspondence from two witnesses, (known as Richard and Dan) who claimed to have actually seen the abduction.<p> Doubtful at first about these witnesses, their claims would ultimately be a building block of the case itself. Agreeing perfectly with Linda's account of the abduction, the two men were bodyguards of a senior United Nations statesman who was visiting Manhattan. This diplomat would eventually be identified as Javier Perez de Cuellar, who, according to his two bodyguards, was visibly shaken while viewing the surreal scene. These three men encountered an unbelievable sight...the plight of a woman being floated through the air, and not only that...but three entities were also being floated, accompanying her on a short trip to a massive hovering flying craft. <p>

Linda's own words: <p>
<i>
"I'm standing up on nothing. And they take me out all the way up, way above the building. Ooh, I hope I don't fall. The UFO opens up almost like a clam and then I'm inside," said 41 year old (at the time) Linda.<p>
 "I see benches similar to regular benches. And they're bringing me down a hallway. Doors open like sliding doors. Inside are all these lights and buttons and a big long table."<p>

 "I don't want to get up on that table. They get me on the table anyway. They start saying things to me and I'm yelling. I can still yell. One of them says something that sounds like {Nobbyegg}. I think they were trying to tell me to be quiet because he put his hand over my mouth." </i>

The high-level of security clearance and professionalism required for the two bodyguards' positions would be no help in dealing with what they had seen. What they witnessed that night would become a curse to them, having a deep impact on their lives for years to come. <p>They would become irrational and psychotic, and one of them would become to think of Linda as having some unusual, extraordinary power or influence on others. He began to stalk her. Did he somehow blame Linda for his emotional behavior and fear? Or would his involvement be a threat to his livelihood? <p>

The actions of the two bodyguards, whom would later be revealed as CIA agents, presented a strange, enigma to Hopkins.
On April 29, 1991 they kidnapped Linda, bundled her into their car in broad daylight and quizzed her for three hours. Dan became increasingly upset with Linda as she repeated stated that she had no idea why it (the abduction) had happened. Linda would be kidnapped a second time by the men who tried to pry information from her, thinking she had a part in the alien abduction herself, which brought them into the case involuntarily.<p> 

One of the agents, Richard, stated:<p>
<i> "There was an oval-shaped object hovering over the top of the apartment building two or three blocks up from where we sat."  <p>

"We didn't know where it came from. It happened too fast. Its lights turned from a bright reddish orange to a whitish blue coming out of the bottom. Green lights rotated round the edge of the saucer. A little girl or woman wearing a white gown sailed out of the window in a fetal position - and then stood in mid-air in this beam of light. I could see three of the ugliest creatures I ever saw. I don't know what they were. They weren't human."<p>

"Their heads were out of proportion, very large heads with no hair. Those buggers were escorting her into the craft. My partner screamed, 'We have got to get them.' We tried to get out of the car but couldn't. After the woman was escorted in, the oval turned reddish orange again and whisked off."<p></i>

 Hopkins told them that Linda Cortile was the woman they had seen.<p> 


Hopkins' investigation would gain additional momentum when more witnesses to the event would come forward with their stories. <p>As was the usual, Hopkins kept the details of his case private until they reached a certain level of credibility. The additional eyewitnesses stated that they too, had seen the abduction that night from the Brooklyn Bridge. The witnesses (one of which
was one Janet Kimbell?, or Kimble) thought they were watching the filming of a scene from an upcoming Sci-fi film. She was a retired telephone operator. Soon, Hopkins could not keep the lid on the Napolitano abduction any longer.

The case would take a dramatic turn when Hopkins finally discovered the identity of the United Nations representative, or the "third man," as Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former Secretary General of the United Nations. Naturally, Hopkins' dream would be to get Cuellar to go public with his acknowledgment of the facts of the abduction, which would bring the case and the entire alien abduction question to a sensational level of acceptance within the public's eye, and the scientific community. <p>Although Cuellar corresponded with Hopkins and verified the abduction, he explained to Hopkins that he could not go public for obvious reasons. Cuellar went even as far as to meet privately with Hopkins to discuss details of his observations that night, but demanded that he remain anonymous.

The Linda Napolitano affair is without question one of the best documented alien abduction cases in UFO history. Most of these cases are related to authorities and investigators by a single person. It is extremely unusual to have multiple witnesses, especially those totally unknown to the experiencer,  to validate the facts of an alien abduction. Hopkins did an exceptional job of holding together the case, despite some unusual twists and turns. <p> Skeptics, as you would expect, dismiss the case without offering any evidence to support their theories, except the commonly used statement, "it can't happen, so therefore it didn't."  <p>

In a recent French magazine, La Gazette Forteenne, Issue # 2, 2003, Linda gives an interview that does add some new facts about her case. She mentions a new witness, a New York Post truck driver, who saw the abduction from the Brooklyn Bridge. No name is given<p>

There had also been rumors of the abduction causing a small traffic jam on the intersection between South Street and Catherine Slip. Now, there is a witness who saw the stopped traffic at approximately the same time as the abduction. Linda says:<p>
<i>
"At the New York Post complex, a well-known journalist leaves a nearby bar. Too drunk to drive, he asks one of the drivers if he can drop him home. The driver answers that the lorries cannot move because there are several limos blocking the street. He even suspected that the big boss could be paying a visit to the newspaper." </i><p>

Supposedly, the lead limo was the one carrying Dan, Richard, and Cuellar. Hopefully, more information will be forthcoming in the near future. <p>

 On July 8, the pilot and passengers of a Cessna 172 Skyhawk were approached by a UFO over Warren, Ohio about 10:20 p.m. Two brothers, Richard and Ken Montgomery, with Elizabeth Soverns and Rosalind Rians as passengers, were flying at about 4,000 feet over Warren; Richard Montgomery was at the controls. <p>

"I noticed an object coming toward us from the direction of Youngstown to the southeast," he related. "I swung over... to get a closer look when the object headed directly toward our airplane. <p>It stopped and hung motionless in the air... momentarily, and as our aircraft came closer, it moved swiftly upward and came back at us from another angle." 
<p>
Montgomery said the UFO appeared metallic and had a light beaming from its underside. He estimated it was from six to ten feet in diameter and from 16 to 20 feet tall. 
<p>
The pilot maneuvered the plane several times, but the object kept following at a distance of from 150 to 200 yards. Then the UFO "suddenly sped in an easterly direction at amazing speed and was quickly out of sight." 
<p>
During this encounter, control tower operators at Youngstown Municipal Airport received calls from area residents concerning "a dogfight between two aircraft in the skies over Warren."

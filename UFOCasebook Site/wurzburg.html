Wurzburg, Germany - March 8, 2009<p>
Last Sunday I had a rather strange encounter with a disturbing object in the sky above Wurzburg, Germany. I was walking along the railroad lines along the river Main to scout new fishing locations. It was already pretty late, it was getting dark, I started to freeze and I wanted to move back towards the city, when I noticed the silence. <p>
There was no car, nothing. I stopped and looked around me. Although it was a pretty bad day to be out, nature had a strange beauty in the fading daylight. <p>Suddenly I got a strange feeling in my chest, like when I was standing on a vibrating platform, but only very faint. Suddenly I felt weak and then I noticed an object in the sky. <p>It was hovering just at the base of the deep hanging clouds and disappeared every once in awhile into the moving clouds maintaining its altitude.<p> There was no sound except some light wind, only the strange humming feeling inside my body, maybe like pulsating electricity, I have no idea, I haven't felt like that before.<p> At first, while it was still pretty close, I didn't move at all. I was like in a shock. But while it slowly moved away I realized that what I was seeing might be quite unique and took out my cell phone.<p> I wanted to take a picture but the display wasn't working right. The images had stripes and pressing the trigger didn't do anything.<p> Only when the object was already pretty far it worked, I shot the attached picture and then, seconds later, the disk was covered in clouds once more and I never saw it again. Here are a few facts: 
<p>
size: can't tell, but I would guess it was pretty big, like 50 meters maybe? The clouds, although deep this day, are still a few hundred meters above ground, so the thing should be bigger than just 10 meters. 
<p>
Shape: flat gray disk with lights at the bottom 
<p>
Height: just below the clouds/ in the clouds 
<p>
Time: around 6 PM, dawn 
<p>
Speed: slowly moving across the sky 
<p>
Lights: three white/bluish and one red, no blinking etc. 
<p>
Duration: very hard to tell, it felt much longer than it probably was, maybe 15 seconds for the whole encounter 
<p>

As I work for the local city administration I cannot give you my real name, nobody would take me serious anymore here in Wurzburg. I never believed in aliens or UFOs, but this thing got me thinking and I actually have no satisfying explanation for it.<p> Maybe you guys know more about this thing, especially because it doesn't look like the typical UFO that I have seen on the many silly photos on TV. 
<p>

Regards, 
<p>

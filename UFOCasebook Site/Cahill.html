<p>
In August 1993, 27-year-old Kelly Cahill, her husband and 
three children were driving home after a visit to a friend's house. Their routine journey would soon become a harrowing trip into an unknown world of strange 
beings that occupied space, but were void of color as we know it.</p>

<p> The 
Dandenong foothills, near Belgrave, Victoria, Australia would have 
its location forever linked to one of the most unusual sightings of a 
strange creature in Ufology archives.</p>

<p> Records from the town of Leicester, 
England in the year of 1928 give an account of another being without color. 
The Cahill family would witness either more of the same, or very 
similar beings in the wee morning hours of August 8.<p>

After midnight the Cahills were on their journey home when
they first noticed the lights of a rounded craft with windows around it.</p>

<p>
It silently hovered above the road. Different colored lights were clearly visible 
on the bottom of the object. The UFO was so close to the ground that 
Kelly thought she could see people through the window openings.</p>

<p> As she 
began screaming to her husband what she was seeing, the craft zoomed off 
to their left, disappearing as quickly as it had made itself known.<p>

Continuing their drive home with a renewed interest in the sky, they 
suddenly came upon a light... a light so bright they were practically 
blinded. </p>

<p>Shading her eyes from the intense light with her hands over 
her eyes, Kelly begged of her husband, "What are you going to do?" </p>

<p>
Her husband now frightened to death by the glowing presence before 
them, replied, "I am going to keep on driving."</p>

<p> Within what seemed only 
a second or two, Kelly was now very relaxed, suddenly calmed by the 
disappearance of the intense, glowing light that had turned night into day 
for a brief few moments.<p>


The first words out of Kelly's mouth were, "What happened, did I blackout?" </p>

<p>
Her husband said nothing, as he had no answer to give his wife. He cautiously 
drove his family home. Upon their safe arrival Kelly could smell a foul 
odor, like vomit, and she suddenly felt as though something was 
missing from their drive home.</p>

<p> Something was missing... an hour or so of 
time had vanished from her and her family's life.<p>

That night as Kelly undressed for bed, she noticed a strange triangular 
mark on her navel, a mark she had never seen before. It must have
been created early this every night. </p>

<p>But how? And why? And most importantly, 
by whom? Kelly suffered from general malaise for the next two weeks, and 
was taken to the hospital on two occasions, one for severe stomach pain, 
and another for a uterine infection.<p>

Kelly would soon begin to remember details of that fearful night, and 
without any outside aid such as regressive hypnosis, or counseling. She 
recalled the object they had seen in a slightly different place than she first remembered.</p>

<p> It was hovering in a gully, and the UFO was big. She estimated 
it at 150 feet in diameter. She could also recall that when the object was first spotted, her husband had stopped the car, and both her and her husband 
had gotten out of the vehicle, and walked in the direction of the massive craft, 
without fear.</p>

<p> It was if they were being subconsciously drawn to the enigmatic, 
otherworldly creation. <p>

To their surprise, they noticed another car stopped on the side of the road. 
As they walked down toward the craft, they saw a creature unlike either of 
them had ever seen before.</p>

<p> It was black, not a black color, but black as if 
all matter was removed where its presence was. Kelly would later describe
it as "not having a soul."<p>

<Img align="left" Src="http://www.ufocasebook.com/cahill2.jpg" hspace="12" vspace="12" alt ="Kelly Cahill Current"><p>


Kelly's words for the alien were "void of color," yet its shape was clearly 
discernible. The black alien entity was taller than an average man, about 
7 feet tall, according to Kelly, and its eyes were large like a fly's, glowing red.<p> Today
After being mesmerized by the sight of the being, she saw more of them. 
"Heaps of them" is how Kelly described them as she stared into the open 
field.<p>

The aliens were out there in the field, beneath the immense flying craft. 
The beings seemed to congregate in small groups, and one group glided 
toward Kelly and her husband, covering a hundred yards in a mere few 
seconds.<p> Another group was approaching the other car which sat motionless 
near the hovering craft.<p>

 

Kelly had a sense that the creatures were evil. She clung to her
husband, fighting the feeling of blacking out. Her great fear and dread would 
cause her to scream at the alien-looking entities to leave them alone.<p> She remembered going unconscious, and then... she was back in their car.<p>

As strange as this encounter seems, it was not without corroboration. 
The occupants in the other car would come forward and tell almost an 
exact story, a story of abduction, mind control, and embarrassing 
procedures.<p>

Kelly recalled through dreams the black alien stooping over 
her helpless, nude body like he was kissing her navel. From all indications 
of the descriptions of the aliens, they were intruding into our dimension, 
taking space in our universe, yet without solid form, though shapes, heads, 
eyes, and arms could be distinguished.<p> Could these strange and eerie beings
simply slipped from a parallel existence into ours? Or were they from a not too
distant future?<p>

The account of Kelly Cahill has been examined and reexamined by many
researchers. Many theories have been put forward, but  
nothing new has been uncovered.<p> Nothing has been proven, or disproved. 
Kelly Cahill was considered a reliable, honest person by those who knew 
her at the time of this strange sighting. Her case is considered legitimate 
by many UFO investigators.<p>

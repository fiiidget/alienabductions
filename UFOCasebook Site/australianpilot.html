1978 - Boats and aircraft found no trace of the 20-year-old Australian pilot who
disappeared with his plane on Saturday night after radioing that he was being
chased by a UFO. <p> Frederick Valentich was on a 125 mile training flight in his
single engine Cessna 182 along the coast of Bass Strait when he told air
traffic controllers in Melbourne that he was being buzzed by a UFO with 4
bright lights about 1000 feet above him.<p>

Controllers said his last message was taped and was: "It's approaching from due
east towards me.  It seems to be playing some sort of game... flying at a speed
I can't estimate.  It's not an aircraft.  It's... It is flying past.  It is a
long shape.  I cannot identify more than that.  It's coming for me right now."<p>
A minute later: "It seems to be stationary.  I'm also orbiting and the thing is
orbiting on top of me also.  It has a green light and a sort of metallic light
on the outside."  <p>Valentich then radioed that his engine was running roughly.<p>
His last words were: "It is not an aircraft."
<p>
The Australian Air Force said it had received 11 reports from people along the
coast who said they saw UFOs on Saturday night, but the Transport Department
was skeptical. <p> Ken Williams, a spokesman for the department, said, "It's funny
all these people ringing up with UFO reports well after Valentich's
disappearance.  It seems people often decide after the event, they too had seen
strange lights.  But although we can't take them too seriously, we can never
discourage such reports when investigating a plane's disappearance."<p>

Some Transport Dept officials have speculated that Valentich became disoriented
and saw his own lights reflected in the water, or lights from a nearby island,
while flying upside down.<p>

Valentich's father, Guio, said his son used to study UFOs "as a hobby using
information he had received from the Air Force.  He was not the kind of person
who would make up stories.  Everything had to be very correct and positive for
him.<p>  "The fact that they have found no trace of him really verifies the fact
that UFOs could have been there."<p> Guio Valentich said he hoped his son hadn't
crashed but had been taken by a UFO.<p>
 <p>
Editors Note: It is a total misconception that UFO reports were only made after Valentich's report. According to the Victorian UFO Research Society, based at Moorabbin, near the location from where the disappearance took place, there had been a UFO wave ongoing for at least six weeks before the date of Valentich's disappearance.

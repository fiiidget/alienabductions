Night Fishing 
<p>
As 77-year-old Alfred Burtoo was fishing the Basingstoke Canal in the peaceful early hours of the morning of August 12, 1983, he saw a brilliant light descend from the sky and settle on the nearby towpath.<p> Thinking it must be a helicopter from the nearby MOD base, he took no notice, and poured himself a cup of tea from his Thermos flask. Then his dog, Tiny, began whining furiously and two figures emerged from the darkness. 
<p>
"They were about four foot high, dressed in pale green coveralls from head to foot," Burtoo told reporters. "And they had helmets of the same colour with a visor that was blacked out." 
<p>
The strangers gestured to Burtoo to accompany them. Calmly setting down his cup of tea, the intrepid pensioner follow them along the towpath towards a saucer-shaped craft. "I was 77 and didn't have much to lose," he later explained. 
<p>
Inside the Saucer 
<p>
Climbing up a set of steps into the saucer, Burtoo discovered that the ceiling was so low he had to stoop. He found himself inside a black, metallic octagonal chamber, which smelt slightly of decaying meat. 
<p>
"I did not see any signs of nuts or bolts, nor did I see any seams where the object had been put together," he recalled. "What did interest me most of all was a shaft that rose up from the floor to the ceiling. The shaft was about four feet in circumference, and on the right-hand side stood two forms similar to those that walked along the towpath with me." 
<p>
One of the beings told the old man to stand beneath an orange light, which appeared to scan him for a few minutes. "What is your age?" asked the entity, in a "sing-song" voice which sounded like "a mixture of Chinese and Russian". When he replied that he was 78, it declared: "You can go. You are too old and infirm for our purposes." Bemused, Burtoo climbed down from the saucer and returned to his fishing spot. 
<p>
"The first thing I did... was to pick up my cold cup of tea and drink it," he recalled. "And then I heard this whining noise, just as if an electric generator was starting up, and this thing lifted up then took off at a very high speed." 
<p>
Apparently unfazed by his bizarre encounter, Burtoo resumed the task at hand. "I got into what I had come out for - the fishing!" Despite his rather curt reception, he later declared his nocturnal adventure to have been "the greatest experience of my life". 
<p>
Quality Control? 
<p>
Alfred Burtoo is not alone in having apparently failed an alien medical test. American abductee Carl Higdon believed that he had been rejected as a guinea pig for a hybrid breeding program because his captors discovered that he had had a vasectomy.<p> Likewise, Luis Oswald, an elderly Brazilian abducted in 1979 by beings who claimed to be from "a small galaxy near Neptune", reported that she had endured a lengthy examination then been told she was "of no use".

Dear Sir, <p>

The included picture was taken by my grandfather in the early 1930s. I 
scanned the image immediately after he gave it to me last week.<p> I wish to 
remain anonymous since I don't want anything to do with any research or 
whatever on this.<p>
 I know it looks like an alien or a Bigfoot and I know my 
grandfather was telling me the truth about him taking this picture. That's 
why I think it should be in the right hands.<p> You are the only one I'm 
sending this to, so please respect my privacy and don't contact me about 
this.<p>
Thanks in advance,<p>

Yours, <p>
(Name withheld)<p>

The only additional information is contained on the bottom of the full size image, which tells us the following:<p>


The picture was taken in the early 1930s by the sender's grandfather, who lived in Alaska. The entitiy was first seen when the grandfather was on his way to a lake. He chased the entity until he got close enough to take this one picture. It was some four months before the photograph was developed, being in in a remote, sparsely populated area.<p> The sender received the picture from his grandfather only last week  His grandfather died the day after giving him the photo, and relating his story.<p>

To say the least, I was intrigued by this mysterious message. What could this image be? I downloaded it, and after looking at it a few moments, I knew it would be controversial to say the least.<p> Little did I know that there would be more than one mystery to solve. As I began the task of selecting and cutting the area around the small creature, I thought to myself: "Wouldn't it be something if this was the real thing, even though it may never be proven as such?"<p> What if this gentleman's grandfather had really filmed a creature from another world, and I was looking at the proof. My excitement was only tempered by the thought of not being able to prove it one way or the other. I would soon be faced, however, with the second mystery.<p>

After doing a couple of trial runs, I was relatively pleased with the results, considering the fact that the scanned image was from a photograph approximately 70 years old.<p> As I looked through several of the cutouts I had made, I thought maybe I saw something... something else.<p> The entity's right lower arm/hand region seemed to be obscured; but by what? So I went back to the original scan, and starting working on that particular area. What I finally saw, or thought I saw was a second, even smaller entity.<p> Is it possible that we had a female with her child? I had done what I could, and the results were inconclusive.<p>
<p>

I thought of the many other alleged photos of aliens, and how they were met with much skeptism. In other words, I have no definite answer as to what we are looking at here. It is one of three things:<p>

1) An outright hoax, (someone in a suit) and all their time and effort was wasted.<p>

2) A single unknown being, origin unknown, and we are without a way to go any further toward discovery.<p>

3)  Number 2, with two beings.<p>

All is not lost, and just like beauty being in the eye of the beholder, so is the result of what we have here.<p>
One final question remains; Which is more important anyway, the final solution of a mystery, or that mystery remaining alive and well?<p>

A USO report from MUFOR on the internet as follows:<p>

Witnesses: Pawlu Zammit and others<p>

Location: 20 miles S of Malta<p>

Object: Black submarine, or other type of craft?<p>

Sound: None<p>

Notes: Fishermen on a boat 20 miles south of Malta were raising their nets with a catch of fish when they saw an object floating on the water's surface that looked like a black submarine. The fishermen were frightened because they thought it looked more like a monster than a submarine, so they quickly pulled in their nets and started the boat's engine.<p> At that moment a bright light from the "submarine" lit up the whole area and "little men" began running over the deck of the object. <p>The fishermen couldn't make out much detail from their boat but whenever the light illuminated the "little men," they could see some sort of apparatus around their waist.<p>

When the witness was asked how tall these men were, he replied, "About the size of a 10 year old boy." After a few minutes, the "little men" entered the "submarine" which began to glow so brightly that the fishermen couldn't see the object. It then submerged.   <p>

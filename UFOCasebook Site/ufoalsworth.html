The information that you are about to read, about a UFO incident, was
  supplied to Vangard  Sciences by Mr.Warren York. This  information was
  obtained through the government Freedom of Information Act.<p>

This UFO incident allegedly occurred at Alsworth AFB in South Dakota, about 7 miles southwest of Nisland, Dakota.<p>
 At 2059hrs., 16 Nov. 1977, Airmen 1C  Phillips,  Lt.  A.Lims  Security
  Control, telephone WSC. reported an O2 alarm activation at L-9. <p>
  Lims SAT  #1,  A-1C  Jenkins  &  A-1C  Raeke were dispatched, (Trip #62, ETA
  2135hrs.)
<p>
  At 2147hrs., A-1C Phillips telephones WSC and reported that the situation at
  L-9 had been upgraded to a COVERED WAGON PER REQUEST OF Capt. Stokes, Larry
  D., FSO.<p>
<p>
  Security Option 11 was initiated by WSC and Base CSC.  BAF (Backup  Security
  Force) #1&&2, was  formed.  At  2340hrs.,  16  Nov.  77,  the  following
  information was  learned: <p> Upon  arrival  (2132hrs.)  at  Site  #L-9.  LSAT.
  Jenkins &  Raeke, dismounted the SAT vehicle to make a  check  of  the  site
  fence line.
<p>
  At this  time Raeke observed a bright light shinning vertically upwards form
  the rear of the fence line of L-9. (There is a small hill approximately 50
  yards behind L-9)<p>

  Jenkins stayed with the SAT vehicle and Raeke proceeded to the source of the
  light to investigate. As Raeke approached the crest of the hill, he observed
  an individual dressed in a glowing, green metallic uniform and wearing  a
  helmet with visor.
<p>
  Raeke immediately challenged the individual, however; the individual refused
  to stop and kept walking towards the rear fence line of L-9. Raeke aimed his
  M-16 rifle at the intruder and ordered him to stop.<p>

  The intruder turned towards Raeke and aimed a object at him which emitted
  a bright flash of intense light. The  flash of light struck Raeke's M-16
  rifle, disintegrating the weapon and causing second and third degree burns
  to his hands.
<p>
  Raeke immediately took cover and concealment and radioed the situation to
  Jenkins, who in turn radioed a 10-13  distress to Line  Control.  Jenkins
  responded to Raeke's position and carried Raeke back to  the SAT vehicle.
  Jenkins then returned to the rear fence line to stand guard.<p>

  Jenkins observed  two intruders dressed in the same uniforms, walk through
  the rear fence line of L-9. Jenkins challenged the two individuals, but they
  refused to stop. Jenkins aimed and fired two rounds from his M-16 rifle.
<p>
  One bullet struck one intruder in the back and one bullet struck one
  intruder in  the  helmet.  Both  intruders  fell to the ground,  however,
  approximately 15 seconds later, Jenkins took cover and the light missed
  Jenkins.<p>

  The two intruders returned to the east side of the hill and disappeared.
  Jenkins followed the two and observed them go inside a saucer shaped object
  approximately 20' in diameter and 20' thick. The  object  emitted  a glowing
  greenish light.
<p>
  Once the intruders were inside, the object climbed vertically upwards  and
  disappeared over  the  Eastern  horizon.   BAF #1  arrived  at the site at
  2230hrs., and set up a security perimeter. Site Survey Team arrived at the
  site (0120hrs.) and took radiation readings, which measured  from 1.7 to 2.9
  roentgens.<p>

  Missile Maintenance examined the missile and warhead, and found the nuclear
  components missing from the warhead.  Col.  Speaker,  Wing Cmdr. arrived at
  the site and set up an investigation.  A completed follow-up  report of this
  incident will be submitted by order of Col. Speaker.<p>
<p>
  FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION: Raeke was treated at the base hospital for second and
  third degree radiation burns to each hand.
<p>
  Raeke M-16 rifle could not be located at the site.<p>

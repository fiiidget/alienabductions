A sighting of a UFO occurred in the 1960s in India.  One of my friend's grandfather had (recently passed away) witnessed the incident. He stated that a total of three villages (Hamlets) witnessed the incident. <p>The total number of witnesses to the incident is around 800-1000. <p>

It is documented at some sites on the Internet.
 <p>
Ijapada Chatterjee was working in his office at the mica mine outside Manbhum that day (he was the manager) when he heard the miners shouting. <p>

Rushing outdoors, Chatterjee "watched a saucer-shaped object descend to an altitude of about 500 feet. The UFO hovered, then soared upwards at terrific speed, causing a tremendous gust of wind."<p>
 
"The object was seen over a mine which has supplied berylium for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission."<p>

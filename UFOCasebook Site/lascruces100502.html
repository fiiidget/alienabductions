Editors Note: Although the sighting report below identifies the object in question as a disc-shaped object, after enlarging and enhancing the photograph, there is no doubt that the object is triangular-shaped, and more than that, one of the best, clearest pictures of a triangle to date.<p>
The following UFO sighting report with photograph was filed with the National UFO Reporting Center on 03-21-2003. The sighting occurred on October 5, 2002 at 16:49 hours. <p>
The witness states that: <p>
I took four pictures of the mountains to the west of Las Cruces, NM. The camera was a Canon G2 digital. The last shot taken at 4:49 pm was enlarged after downloading to a computer. <p>Only then were the images of 2 objects noticed in the sky. One in the upper left was disk-shaped and appeared metallic in luster. A second object, below and to the right of the first, was apparently much smaller and/or further away. A previous shot taken 2 minutes earlier showed no objects. <p>

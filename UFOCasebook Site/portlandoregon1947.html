Original Title: Saucers made no ordinary fireworks <p>
By Phil Stanford<p>
The Portland Tribune, Jul 3, 2006<p> 



What I do know, however, because I read about it in the newspapers, is that 59 years ago today, scores of Portlanders, including pilots, police officers, and just plain civilians like you and me, saw – or at least thought they saw – flying saucers above the Rose City.<p>

According to no less a source than The Oregonian, the first flying saucers, or whatever they were, were sighted directly over Oaks Amusement Park.
<p>
Immediately, the police bureau put out an “all cars” alert, which was answered by three patrolmen who said they saw them, too.
<p>
One of them, Earl Patterson, identified as an “air corps veteran,” said they were traveling fast, “wobbling and weaving,” and in his opinion they were not airplanes.
<p>
The other two, Walter Lissy and Robert Ellis, both civilian pilots themselves, said what they saw were discs, making sudden changes in direction and traveling at a “terrific speed.”
<p>

<p>
Capt. K.A. Prehn, along with two of his men at Harbor Patrol headquarters on Irving, reported seeing several “discs” pass overhead at a height of 10,000 feet.
<p>
They were unsure whether there were three or six of them because of confusing flashes from the objects, which “seemed to oscillate, weave and turn until … sometimes only a crescent was visible.”
<p>
“Captain Prehn described the sight as a ‘wobbling hubcap.’ A regular plane was in the sky at the time,” the news account continued, “but these were not planes, they agreed.”
<p>
Meanwhile, over at state police headquarters on Southeast McLoughlin, Sgt. Claude Cross reported seeing two objects that looked from a distance like “toy balloons, almost pure white, traveling sideways, with no flashing lights.”
<p>
• • •<p>
But lest you be tempted to take the easy way out – which is, of course, that these mysterious objects were actually top-secret CIA weather balloons – there’s the report from a United Airlines plane en route from Boise to Portland that night.
<p>
Or as the headline at the top of the first page of the July 5 Oregonian unmincingly put it:
<p>
“Air Liner Crew Confirms Flying Discs Over State”
<p>
Shortly after takeoff from Boise, World War II veteran Captain E.J. Smith, plus his co-pilot and a stewardess, spotted nine of them. Upon landing, Smith described them as “bigger than aircraft … very thin, very flat on the bottom and … rough or irregular on the top.”
<p>
The discs, which were flying at about the same altitude as the plane, followed them for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing.
<p>
“No object I know of could disappear so quickly,” observed Smith.
<p>
The Oregonian’s headlines the next day read:
<p>
“Flying Saucers Everywhere; New Tales Convert Skeptics”
<p>
They just don’t write headlines like that over there anymore.
<p>
But then, to be fair, we haven’t had a decent UFO flyby in a long time, either.

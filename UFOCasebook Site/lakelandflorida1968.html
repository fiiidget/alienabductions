October 1968 - Lakeland, Florida
Witnesses:<p> <p>
Mr. & Mrs. McMullen<p>
Miss Sharon Burgess<p> 
Two school students
<p>
Report Summary: 
<p>Mr. & Mrs. McMullen, Miss Sharon Burgess and two school students saw a mysterious object heading towards the McMullen home from a nearby hill. 
<p>
The disc-shaped UFO, approximately 13 feet in diameter and 8 feet high, hovered 7 feet above a palm tree,  a 150 feet distance from the house.<p> Two occupants dressed in white, tight outfits and with headgear, were seen through its transparent dome.<p> Prior to the incident and during the twenty minutes the 'saucer' was present,  Mr. & Mrs. McMullen noted audio and visual interference on their TV... also they complained of a smell, like ammonia, that burned their noses and eyes.<p>
<p>
During the excitement, the McMullen's dog knocked a hole in the screen porch in an effort to get away form the UFO.<p> 
Lakeland police were called, but the 'visitors' had left by the time the police cruiser arrived.
<p> 
The case has never had an adequate solution.

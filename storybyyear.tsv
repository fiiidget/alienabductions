2012, ,"['Airbus Narrowly Avoids Collision with UFOGlasgow, Scotland Airport - 12-21-2012Pilot describes moment an Airbus with up to 220 people on board came dangerously close to crashing into \'UFO\' as it came in to land. Plane narrowly avoided the \'blue and yellow\' object at 3,500ft.Drama happened 13 miles outside Glasgow Airport. Nothing else was noticed on the radar at the time. Object passed beneath the plane before crew could avoid it.The plane was less than 10 seconds away from hitting the object as it flew over Baillieston on the outskirts of Glasgow at 3,500ft and prepared to land.Despite an extensive investigation, the UK Airprox Board - which investigates reports of near misses - was unable to identify the \'blue and yellow\' object which passed below the Airbus 320.The pilot was clearly shocked and reported that there had been a \'high\' risk of collision following the incident on December 2 last year.He told his control tower: \'We just had something pass underneath us quite close. Have you got anything on in our area.\'They replied: \'Negative. We’ve got nothing on radar and we’re not talking to any traffic either\'The unidentified flying object passed directly beneath the plane before either of the crew had a chance to take action to avoid it.Both pilots described the object as \'blue and yellow (or silver) in colour with a small frontal area but that it was ""bigger than a balloon"".\'The airline involved has not been identified by the report authors. Several companies fly in Airbus 320 planes from the airport and they can seat up to 220 people - although the number of seats varies.Approach: The plane was 13 miles away from Glasgow Airport (pictured) when it came within seconds of colliding with the unidentified object.The report authors said they had not been able to work out what the object was.They wrote: \'The controller stated that he was not talking to anyone else in that area and that nothing was seen on radar. Search action was taken with no result and the A320 pilot stated his intention to file an Airprox.\'Additionally, a further detailed review of individual radar sources did not yield any conclusive radar data that matched the A320 pilot\'s description of the encounter.Near miss: A diagram in the report which shows the pilot\'s direction of travel and the unidentified object which is marked as \'CPA 1246\'PILOT REPORTS \'UFO\' AS HE LANDS AT GLASGOW AIRPORTThis is a transcript of what the A320 pilot told the control tower.A320: \'Glasgow Approach [A320 C/S]\'Air Traffic Control: \'[A320 C/S] pass your message\'A320: \'Er yeah we just had something pass underneath us quite close and nothing on TCAS have you got anything on in our area\'Control: \'Er negative er we’ve got nothing on er radar and we’re n-not talking to any traffic either\'A320: \'Er not quite sure what it was but it definitely er quite large and it’s blue and yellow\'Control: \'OK that’s understood er do you have a an estimate for the height\'A320: \'Maybe er yeah we were probably about four hundred to five hundred feet above it so it’s probably about three and a half thousand feet.\'…we seemed to only miss it by a couple of hundred feet it went directly beneath us … wherever we were when we called it in it was within about ten seconds\'… couldn’t tell what direction it was going but it went right underneath us”\'Control: \'do you suspect it might have been a glider or something like that\'A320: \'well maybe a microlight … it just looked too big for a balloon.”\'The Air Traffic Control unit\'s own radar replay also showed no surveillance traces in the immediate vicinity of the A320 at the time.\'A passenger plane came within 300 feet of crashing into a \'UFO\' flying over Glasgow, an official investigation has found.Once on the ground the A320 pilot gave a further description of the event to the Glasgow Aerodrome Controller.The pilot said: \'We seemed to only miss it by a couple of hundred feet it went directly beneath us - wherever we were when we called it in it was within about ten seconds; couldn\'t tell what direction it was going but it went right underneath us.\'Asked if he thought it was a glider, the pilot replied: \'well maybe a microlight - it just looked too big for a balloon.\'But the board ruled out any such aircraft and were baffled.\'The board initially considered likely candidates for the untraced aircraft. The A320 crew had not been able to assimilate any information regarding the form of the untraced aircraft in the fleeting glimpse they had, reporting only a likely colour,\' it said.\'Members were of the opinion that, in the absence of a primary radar return, it was unlikely that the untraced aircraft was a fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft or man-carrying balloon.\'It was considered that a meteorological balloon would be radar significant and unlikely to be released in the area of the Airprox.\'A glider could not be discounted but it was felt unlikely that one would be operating in that area, both due to the constrained airspace and the lack of thermal activity due to the low temperature.\'Similarly, The board considered that a hang-glider or para-motor would be radar significant and that conditions precluded them, as they did para-gliders or parascenders.\'Members were unable to reach a conclusion as to a likely candidate for the conflicting aircraft and it was therefore felt that the Board had insufficient information to determine a cause or risk.\'']"
1880, ,"['Poachers sent packing by flying ball! (1880s)  A sighting of a UFO was made in the 1880s by miners-turned poachers at Padeswood, near Mold, who were disturbed by a ""swirling ball of smoke with tongues of flame"". Richard Holland explains... It\'s a common assumption that the UFO is a modern phenomenon belonging to the Space Age, but this is not the case. Strange lights in the sky have been causing conjecture for centuries. According to Buckley historian James Bentley some striking coal miners encountered what today we would call a UFO way back in the 1880s. Mr Bentley heard the story from relatives of two of the eye-witnesses.It seems that, starved of wages and therefore of food, a gang of miners dared to risk poaching on land belonging to one of the mine owners. If they had been caught it would have meant eviction, and possibly transportation which is why the following story was kept under wraps for so long.One dark moonless night the miners crept down to some fields at Padeswood, near Mold, to collect some snares previously left there. Suddenly they felt tense and afraid, as if someone was watching them. Glancing up, they saw a large, purplish-red luminous ball hovering above them! Silently it descended into the next field.At first the terrified poachers hid their heads under their nets but shortly, on feeling a lessening in the tension in the air, one of their number dared to peer over the hedge. A ""swirling ball of smoke with small tongues of flame issuing from the base, was lifting off the ground"".The men ran home and vowed each other to secrecy. Several days later the bravest of the bunch returned to collect the gear they had left behind in their panic.There was no sign of the UFO, but where they had seen it land there was now a wide, black circle of scorched grass...source & references:Reference: James Bentley and the Clwyd Oral History Project http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northeast/guides/weird/ufos/pages/padeswood_ufo.shtml']"
1997, ,"['The Phoenix Lights, 1997, ArizonaPhoenix Lights DepictionThe EvidenceUFO researchers and writers today are tantalized by the increasing reports of alien abduction, possible photographs of alien beings, physical trace cases, and implant removals.In a way we have become spoiled-expecting the sensational. This desire for ultimate proof has caused us to overlook the seemingly mundane, everyday reports of night lights, which were at one time sensational in their own right.With the ever growing technology of our era, pictures and video are often times called into question because of the ease of manipulation and creation afforded computer graphics experts. Called into question, that is, by those who are waiting in the wings to debunk any and all visible proof of UFOs as suspect of being hoaxed.This is especially true in cases with one or two photos taken by one witness. This has always been a pitfall to researchers who scratch and claw for authentication of a particular photograph or video. There are, however, those cases which have multiple photographs of the same object, taken by many witnesses.This type of case carries the heaviest weight for those who remain on neutral ground on the subject of UFOs. One of the best of these is the Phoenix, Arizona lights case of 1997. Supported by many photographs and videos, this fantastic event is still discussed and analyzed today.The Lights AppearEvidence points to March 13, 1997 as the onset of this extremely compelling account of various and sundry phenomenal lights which moved over the state of Arizona. These lights, though referred to as the ""Phoenix Lights,"" were actually witnessed in at least five other cities.Phoenix has the distinction as the first Arizona city to report the unknown light sources, which were initially spotted over Superstition Mountains, east of the city, at about 7:30 PM. The first reports indicated an object of six points of light, immediately followed by a report of eight connected lights, with a separate ninth, which moved in unison with the eight.The formation was seen again over the Gila River just before 10:00 PM. In a matter of minutes, the enormous, lighted structure had made its way over the southern part of the city of Phoenix. At this time, literally thousands of people witnessed the object or objects. It was at this time, that the first photographs and videos were taken.The final sightings of the night were in Rainbow Valley. Witnesses there reported a very distinct ""V"" formation. This sighting occurred at about 2:00 AM on March 14.The MothershipIt is important to note that there are various descriptions of the lights from the Nevada border throughout Arizona. Some witnesses described a very clear ""V"" shape, while others said that the lights were circular or cresent-shaped. It is only common in night light cases for these differences to come to light. Many factors can attribute to these varying descriptions.One specific object can be seen from different angles, with the angle of the object only reflecting part of its light system, depending on atmospheric or weather conditions, or the very way a witness looks at the object can make this difference. It is very possible that two witnesses can see the same object at the same time, and give two completely different accounts.This fact has been proven in scientific studies of eye witnesses accounts in crime cases. Another possibility in the case in point is that there may have been several different objects of different shapes and sizes. In my own research into this case over the years, I have come to the personal conclusion that the main object over Arizona was of a circular shape, and this is corroborated by the various still and video film taken. There were other shapes observed, but it appears that the ""mother-ship"" was circular.Eyewitness AccountsThough the huge lighted formation seemed to move in a tauntingly slow speed over Arizona, it was reported that strange lights had sped from the Henderson-Las Vegas, Nevada area toward Arizona, and seemed to slow down as it entered the Arizona area.Initial reports described anywhere from 5-7 points of light, and ultimately 8 with a trailing ninth. The enormous object was extremely low, and mountainous areas could be seen behind the craft in pictures, therefore giving photographic experts scale to approximate the elevation from the ground, and the distance from the camera.This would enable an estimate of the craft being a whopping one mile or more in length! The color of its lights were described as ""blue-white,"" to ""yellow-white,"" to ""amber."" Again, these differences of description do not necessitate there being more than one object. During the crafts fast moving period, it was estimated to be moving at Mach 2-3. As it slowed down as if posing to be filmed, the speed dropped to an estimated 10-15 MPH.At one point over Sky Harbor, it reportedly hovered for several minutes. The object was also reported to change shapes, speeds, and colors, as it made its way across the skies of Arizona. Phoenix1\t Phoenix6\t Phoenix2\t Phoenix5Various photographs of the Phoenix Lights(click on pic to view larger image)Between 9:00 and 9:30 PM on the 13th, one extraordinary description was made by a family in Mesa. They said that an enormous craft with a distinctive structure flew over their area. They described a triangle-shaped object with lights at the three corners, and another larger light in its center. Amazingly, they could clearly see panels on the craft which were in a grid pattern.There were also, about this same time, several reports of two round objects which seemed to detach from the larger ""V"" shaped object, only to later rejoin the mother-ship. One witness described the ""V"" shaped mother-ship dividing itself into two separate craft as it moved toward the city of Tucson.Another dramatic description of the mother-ship was made by a group of real estate agents who had subdivided property over the northern part of Phoenix. They would also get a close-up view of the gigantic disc.They estimated the craft to be a staggering two miles wide as it flew at a low altitude near Phoenix. They could see dozens of bright lights along the leading edges, and also a row of windows with ""silhouettes of people.""It also seems highly probably that for some reason, the giant craft turned off its lights, as observers could see only the windows with what appeared to be people shadowed in the glow of the inside. Another family got a brightly lit view of the unknown object, and described its color as ""flat blue-black, like the color of a shotgun barrel.""Among the most reliable witnesses of the craft\'s movements that first night were two airplane pilots, one retired from an airline, and another from Vietnam, who was also a U. S. Marshall. Though seeing the object at different times and places, both men described a craft of ""immense size,"" measuring up to a mile long.The Marshall could also see the city lights of Phoenix reflecting from the bottom of the massive object, while it ""blocked out the stars.""One of the pilots also videotaped the UFO, but had the tape confiscated in a ""men in black"" encounter. In a completely separate incident, a group of witnesses had reported a ""huge discoid"" craft which was ""larger than Sun Devil Stadium at Arizona State University.""This object was hovering just above tree tops at the west end of Sky Harbor runway between 2:00 and 3:00 AM about two weeks prior to March 13.Military InvolvementIt was almost inevitable that the United States Air Force would become involved in an event of this magnitude, and the Phoenix lights mystery would be no exception. While driving down Interstate-I-17 from Camp Verde, a truck driver had been seeing two amber colored UFOs moving ahead of him southward for two whole hours.His destination was a materials plant near Luke Air Force Base. Upon arriving there, the two UFOs hovered nearby.While his truck was being loaded, the driver walked upon a pile of materials to get a better look at the two UFOs. He could make out two identical ""toy, top-like amber orbs"" with a white glow to them. A band of red lights pulsated on the craft as it hovered near the Luke AFB runway.Suddenly, two F-16s ""blasted out of Luke with their afterburners on full."" Soon, a third plane followed, and all three made a direct run toward the hovering UFOs.As the first two jets were about to reach the UFOs, the unknown objects shot straight upward, and disappeared ""in an instant."" The two jets flew right through the exact spot the UFOs had previously occupied. A Luke ground crewman later confirmed to NUFORC that the driver\'s account was true.He also stated that upon returning to the base runway, one of the pilots had to be helped from his cockpit. He was visibly shaken from what had just happened.According to Peter Davenport of the NUFORC one of the more intriguing reports was submitted by a young man who claimed to be an Airman stationed at Luke Air Force Base, located to the west of Phoenix in Litchfield Park.He telephoned the National UFO Reporting Center at 3:20 a.m. on Friday, some eight hours after the sightings on the previous night, and reported that two USAF F-15c fighters had been “scrambled” from Luke AFB, and had intercepted one of the objects.Although the presence of F-15’s could never be confirmed, the airman provided detailed information which proved to be highly accurate, based on what investigators would reconstruct from witnesses over subsequent weeks and months.Two days after his first telephone call, the airman called to report that he had just been informed by his commander that he was being transferred to an assignment in Greenland. He has never been heard from again since that telephone call.The Flare TheoryThe Phoenix lights case is not without its controversy, much of which originated from the Air Force. In May of 1997, Luke AFB Public Affairs Office stated that Air Force personnel had investigated the so-called ""UFOs,"" and had solved the case. They claimed that flares dropped from an A-10 ""Warthog"" had caused the numerous reports of night lights. This explanation is totally unfounded for several reasons.First of all, flares do not move in unison, fall toward the ground, and then fly back up into the air, and move across many miles without changing their relative positions. Secondly, many witnesses had made reports of the giant lights hours before the reported time of the launch of the flares.This would not be end of the Phoenix lights. Sightings over the Phoenix area have continued to this day, supported by eyewitness accounts, photographs and video.Article from The Arizona Republic.3-11-98Steve Wilson - Republic Columnist\'Phoenix Lights\' witnesses credible, hard to dismiss:When the ""Phoenix Lights"" were reported last year, I yawned. I didn\'t see them, and breathless TV broadcasts were underwhelming. It seemed easy enough to dismiss the lights as flares or military aircraft. UFOs? You\'ve got to be kidding.Still, as the March 13 anniversary of the sightings approached, I was curious enough to seek out some witnesses. I suspected most would turn out to be UFO devotees. My skepticism was heightened by a New Times story last week that debunked the extraterrestrial theorizing and discredited a leading local theorist, Jim Dilettoso, as a ""quack scientist.""I found several people with credible credentials who witnessed the lights. At the least, their stories are interesting. Even if you regard their accounts dubiously, as I do, they raise legitimate questions.Enough questions, says Peter Davenport, director of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, that what happened that night ""may rank as the most dramatic UFO event in the past 50 years.""First, a little background. The lights were spotted between 7:30 and 10:30 in the evening over a 300-mile corridor from the Nevada line through Prescott Valley and Phoenix to the northern edge of Tucson. Some reports indicate that a single ""V"" formation traveled across the state, while others suggest multiple UFO events. The lights were seen by hundreds of people.Here are four:Dr. Bradley Evans, 47, is a clinical psychiatrist from Tucson. He and his wife, Kris, were driving north on Interstate 10 to a swimming meet in Tempe. They watched the lights for 20 minutes or so move slowly south in a diamond formation and pass over them at an estimated 1,500 feet. Even then, with the car\'s moon roof open, they heard not a sound from the sky. He was ""awed"" by the experience and has no idea what he saw. Kris said she couldn\'t explain it either and guesses it was ""something military.""Trig Johnston, 50, is a retired commercial airline pilot who lives in north Scottsdale. His 22-year-old son was looking for Comet Hale-Bopp that night when he noticed the lights and told his dad.""I looked up and remember saying out loud, ""I\'m going to chalk this up to an illusion.\' It was the size of 25 airliners, moving at about 100 knots at maybe 5,000 feet, and it didn\'t make a sound.I\'ve flown 747s across oceans and not seen anything like I saw that night,"" Johnston said.""I don\'t expect anybody to take my word for it,"" he added. ""This was something you had to see for yourself to believe.""Max Saracen, 34, is a real estate consultant who lives in north Phoenix. He and his wife, Shahla, were driving west on Deer Valley Road when they saw a huge triangular craft. They pulled off the road, got out and watched it pass overhead. ""It was very spooky -- this gigantic ship blocking out the stars and silently creeping across the sky. I don\'t know of any aircraft with silent engines.""Dr. X is a physician who lives near Squaw Peak in Phoenix and asked to remain anonymous for fear of ridicule.Her home has an elevated, panoramic view of the Valley, and she has some of the best known videotape and photographs of the lights. Though she had no prior interest in UFOs, the episode prompted her to begin her own investigation.""I think what happened is mind-boggling,"" she said. ""I\'m trying to be as scientific as I can, and a number of things just don\'t compute.""I\'m not given to an otherworldly answer. But neither do I think these four people and so many others who saw the lights are all exaggerating or delusional.Of all the explanations, a U.S. military operation of some sort, maybe testing experimental aircraft, seems most likely. Mitch Stanley of Scottsdale said he could clearly see several planes when he pointed his telescope at the lights. But if it was a classified operation, why conduct it directly over the nation\'s sixth-biggest city?And if it wasn\'t, why hasn\'t the military simply acknowledged it?You don\'t have to be a ufologist to be puzzled about what lit the sky that night.Steve Wilson - Republic Columnist~end of article~', '1997 UFO Crash VideoFair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

Multiple sightings of UFOs on one night, preceded by several nights of unusual light beams reported over the Great Orme are related to us by well known investigator Margaret Fry. The events of November 10, 1997 center on one unfortunate family who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. For a brief period of time, they entered an unknown realm of other worldly beings.The family was driving along on the Bodfair / Landernog road when all of a sudden their car was engulfed by purple...a purple craft seemed to join itself to their automobile. The next clear memory any of the family had was that the craft was suddenly gone... like it just disappeared into thin air. The family was again driving down the road, resuming their journey except for the feeling of the loss of time.""But they could not account for considerable hours of time lost,"" said Fry. ""The male was having trouble afterwards with a top molar tooth and he had to go to the dentist\'s... and a black unknown object fell out while he was at the dentist\'s - but he had no fillings,"" she said.Shortly afterward, the male driver of the car reported the strange happenings to local authorities. Soon he was visited on two different occasions by Air Force personnel. They warned the man to never speak of the events of November 10, 1997 publicly. These visits are very similar to tales in America of the infamous ""men in black."" The strange purple craft and missing time experienced by the family was told only to a friend, who in turn related the event to investigator Fry. The names of the individuals involved remain anonymous. The case of the alleged abduction is extremely interesting in the light of the reports of the strange light beams and another eerie encounter of the same night.A local business man would corroborate the two other sightings with a bizarre report of his own. The man claimed to see a strange craft on the same road as the abducted family\'s encounter took place. He described the craft as enormous, and the shape of a ""child\'s spinning top."" He was able to draw a sketch of what he observed that night, while stopping to look at a UFO as big as a football field.The UFO, a classic saucer shaped object, was seen hovering over buildings in the village of Llandernog. He claimed that the large craft had a ""myriad of lit windows, ""and was large enough to be a mother ship capable of transporting hundreds of people. What was this enormous ship seen that night, except a visitor from another world? The case has never been explained by any earthly object or conventional means, and remains a mystery to this day.(B J Booth)<!--google_ad_client = ""pub-7518747415195612"";/* 728x90, created 7/4/08 */google_ad_slot = ""5690704701"";google_ad_width = 728;google_ad_height = 90;//-->sources / references:BBC/North East Wales/Margaret Fry Return to :  Alien Abductions Index UFO Casebook Home', 'South Africa UFO Encounter, 1997This sighting took place in September 1997 while travelling home from windsurfing on an inland lake in South Africa. The journey took us past the CSIR (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) buildings on the periphery of the city of Pretoria which we passed on our left. It was dusk and we were travelling in a southerly direction home towards Johannesburg. My son (who is now a military instructor pilot and captain in the air force) and my wife were present while I was driving, with my son sitting on my left. My attention was drawn to what appeared a very tall tower of stacked disks ahead of us, slightly off to the right of the road, this tower conically tapered towards the bottom disk, i.e. the diameter of the top disk was largest and bottom smallest. The time taken from first sighting to passing the tower orthogonally to our right was approximately five minutes at a driving speed of some 120 km/h, resulting in a distance estimate of about 10 km.Each disk was dimly glowing with a reddish evenly distributed light and its equatorial circumference contained several bright orange light sources, about six or seven of these visible on each disk. We mentioned the phenomenon to each other and began to discuss possible explanations. In order to test that this was not due to some internally reflective optical effect (I was reasonably convinced that it could not be, anyway, but wanted to be as objectively scientific in the observation as possible) I opened the driver\'s window and looked at the ""tower"" from outside - confirming that it was an external, ""real"" phenomenon - this was further supported by seeing our progressive approach to it and its growing apparent dimensions in our perspective. We observed that ""disks"" would periodically, at regular intervals, detach from the bottom of the tower and ""fly,"" move off, in different directions - some would take approximately parallel courses, others would vary radically in their relative direction to previous disks. Although we followed the flight of these departing disks in some direct, and thereafter peripheral vision, our primary attention stayed with the ""tower"".We observed somewhere between ten to fifteen disks depart this way but did not feel motivated to make an accurate count - continually we had to balance our sense of ""reality"" against what we were seeing and it was to say the least, an unsettling and surely disturbing phenomenon - it was not easily intellectually digestible. Although the ""tower"" remained apparently stationary, the disks that flew off certainly appeared to be under intelligent, if not pre-programmed, stochastically robotic control.Knowing that four parallel fingers of one hand at arm\'s reach span about ten degrees I measured the apparent height of the tower shortly after sighting at about thirty-five degrees at the estimated ten kilometers - resulting in an estimated height of 7 km - this result did not surprise me due to the enormity of the ""tower"" and the time taken to approach and pass it. The top disk easily spanned four parallel, vertically held fingers, which after some rough trig. works out to an estimated diameter of at least 1,7 km. The bottom disk of the ""tower"" was some ten degrees above ground, which would put it at 1,8 km altitude - and a resulting ""total tower height of approximately 5,2 km. These are of course estimates but I would guarantee them as being within 20% of the true dimensions.No unusual sound was heard that would have apparently emitted from the ""tower"" or individual disks during the entire event. No electronic / electromechanical or physiological disturbance was noted, beyond the induced emotional effects of the sighting.The orthogonal distance to our right as we passed the tower was difficult to judge due to the effect of it seeming to ""float"" and the near-to-medium foreground under the apparent position of the ""tower"" drifting in the opposite direction of our travel underneath it. There was no clear relating landmark or beacon that I could later use as distance reference.We mutually confirmed that we were seeing what we apparently were seeing - during this time the road was quite busy and we could tell from sideways glances, that the occupants of passing cars, and those we passed, were also all looking, and some pointing to the phenomenon - this, believe it or not, was an important objective confirmation to us.I reported this sighting the next day to personnel at the Johannesburg Planetarium (some of whom I knew personally, having done a course in Astronomy and also having bought a 4"" Newtonian reflector telescope from them years earlier) There was little and if any, skeptical interest - further, I did not hear of any follow up, either privately or via the media. I am not interested in publicity at all - but think that responsible reporting and thorough follow-up investigation is vital in such cases. My personal opinion is that reporting subjects should be willing to voluntarily submit to polygraph testing with regard to the reported content of sightings - such not only to support the verity and facticity of their reports, but more importantly to support a body of reliable evidence. I would certainly be willing to submit to any verification supporting procedures.In conclusion it may appear strange that we did not drastically slow our speed or even stop - this was however a high-speed freeway and stopping is not allowed except in emergency; further we wanted to remain in the right-hand lane, incidentally the fastest, as the ""tower"" was clearly going to pass on our right. The apparantly slow speed of our approach to the phenomenon was another reason motivating the maintenance of our road-speed.One emphatically expressed opinion that I will eternally remember being uttered as we passed the tower and we observed another disk departing was: ""My God, it\'s a mothership and those are \'daughter-disks\'..."" Whether that sentiment was anywhere near an accurate assessment we may of course never know.I would be interested if any party who witnessed this specific event as well, or has seen a similar phenomenon, would supply their view and sighting report.Sincerely,Frank ValentynSubmitted to UFO Casebook<!--google_ad_client = ""pub-7518747415195612"";/* 728x90, created 7/4/08 */google_ad_slot = ""5690704701"";google_ad_width = 728;google_ad_height = 90;//-->', ""1997, Swissair Jet Has Near Miss With UFO  February 2000 - Strangely Shaped UFO Photographed   Stinson Lake, proximate to a U.S. army training area, may be an alien or government UFO base, or a focus of investigation or travel by aliens, one reason being possible mining as the area is rich in precious minerals. A mirror ship was photographed directing a beam of light at the hillside. Two questions that come to mind are: What was it? And why was it at an army operations area?   I was given a photograph last night of an object above the snow covered evergreens in the soupy late afternoon February sky of 2000 at Stinson Lake. It is not a painted object such as blue underneath and white on top, or black, or part metal and paint...   It is like a mirror reflecting the milky white sky above and the forest below color for color, tone for tone, hue for hue with intensity above surrounding fields at nearest equator and diminishing below surrounding fields (slightly faded at outer or left and right edges) undeniably displaying a round or roundish shape.   There are no wings and no engines noise according to the photographer. There is a shadow outlining its shape in a clearing below it and the same shadow is on the underside reflection. There's more.   After closely examining the object utilizing digital enhancement techniques, globes are seen underneath with hints of green and white lights, a possible dome on top which almost completely blends in with the sky and globular energy field where there are color shifts in the pixel spectrum where there are no added colors but a reorganization of existing colors suggesting a mirage effect also seen with the Mexico videos. The shifted field forms a perfect globe around the object exactly touching is outer edge no matter the attitude of the craft.   Sitting back a little from a 600% enlargement on the monitor screen, a field 'net' effect is obvious. The field appears webbed like a fish net formed into a globe and transparent white. Further, there is evidence of a beam of light pointing at a dark round spot also in a clearing on a nearby hill.   Above the object is a mushroom-shape distortion similar to the globular energy field but larger, which raises the question of the portal of origin or a second ship. It was so sudden, the photographer never had any indication of what was about to transpire as he shot landscape photographs in the otherwise peaceful environs around him.   The photographer happened to be at the site near where the U.S. Army has historically conducted paratrooper and other training. The Army's conventional presence may well have been replaced by something extremely advanced. But the sightings have not diminished in that remote and tranquil location unlikely to be stumbled upon by any tourist. ""]"
1980, ,"['The Alan Godfrey Abduction, November 28, 1980From United Kingdom Ufologist Jenny RandlesIn November and December 1980, the eastern side of Britain was experiencing a major UFO sighting wave. There were chases of UFOs by police cars near the coast, a UFO that overflew an oil rig in the North Sea, and the wave culminated in the famous events on the East Anglian coast at Rendlesham Forest. Just a month before these landings beside those NATO air bases, one of the most impressive alien abduction cases took place in the small Penninemill town of Todmorden, West Yorkshire, right in the centre of Britain\'s most active window area known locally as ""UFO Alley"". Police Constable Alan Godfrey was on patrol on the night of 28 November 1980. Just before dawn he drove along Burnley Road on the edge of Todmorden looking for some cows that had been reported missing. They were only found after sun-up, mysteriously relocated in a rain-soaked field without hoofmarks to indicate their passage. Giving up his nocturnal hunt, Godfrey was about to go back to base to sign off duty when he saw a large mass a few hundred yards ahead. At first, he thought it was a bus coming towards him that took workers to their jobs in town and that he knew passed about 5:00 a.m. But as he approached, he realized that it was something very strange. It was a fuzzy oval that rotated at such speed and hovered so low over the otherwise deserted highway that it was causing the bushes by the side to shake. The police officer stopped, propped onto his windscreen a pad that was in the patrol car to make sketches of any road accidents, and drew the UFO. Then there was a burst of light, and the next thing he knew he was driving his car again, further along Burnley Road, with no sign of the UFO. Godfrey turned around and examined the spot where the UFO had hovered. The road was very wet as it had rained heavily earlier in the night. But just at this one location was a circular patch where the roadway had been dried in a swirled pattern. Only when back at the police station did he realise that it was a little later than he had expected - although any missing time was probably no greater than 15 minutes from estimates later taken on site. Concerned as to possible ridicule, Godfrey at first chose not to make an official report, but changed his mind later that day when he discovered he was not alone. After breakfast that morning, a driver who had been on Burnley Road three miles further out at Cliviger reported seeing a brilliant white object and contacted Todmorden police. The time matched that of Alan Godfrey\'s. Furthermore, a police patrol from an adjacent force (Halifax) had been engaged in a stakeout for stolen motorcycles on the moors of the Calder Valley and had witnessed a brilliant blue-white glow descending into the valley towards Todmorden shortly before Godfrey experienced his close encounter. Their story, when it reached Todmorden police station, formed a second match. Encouraged by this news Godfrey filed an official report, but was surprised when police chose to release the story to the local newspaper the following week. From here, UFOlogists discovered the case and a lengthy investigation was mounted by a Manchester-based UFO group.  Although Alan Godfrey had no further conscious recall of the missing time, he did have increasingly confused memory of the sequence of events surrounding the sighting (with an unexplained image of seeing himself outside the car during the sighting). There was also puzzling physical evidence. His police-issue boots were split on the sole, as if he had been dragged along the floor and they had caught on something. He also reported a previous history of seeing other strange things and having experienced at least one earlier time lapse as a youth—factors that UFOlogists have come to recognise as common with abduction cases. When sure that all conscious testimony had been recorded, Godfrey agreed to be hypnotically regressed by a Manchester psychiatrist eight months after the incident. He eventually had several other sessions with different therapists, and his recall in later sessions was video-taped. The doctor refused permission to the UFO group for the first session to be recorded. The hypnotic testimony is very odd, and Godfrey was never to be sure what really happened. Under regression he told of the bright light stopping the car engine, causing his radio and police handset both to be filled with static and then to be swamped by blinding light as he lost consciousness. His next recall was of being inside a strange room, more like a house than a spaceship, complete with a most unexpected large black dog. He was studied by a heavily bearded man who telepathically conveyed that his name was ""Yosef"" and whose clothing was very Biblical in nature. Assisting Yosef were several small robot-like creatures ""the size of a five-year-old lad"" and with ""a head shaped like a lamp"". They are reminiscent of the ""Grays"" of UFO lore; although with major differences. Godfrey was supposedly asked questions, told that he ""knew"" Josef, and was promised a later encounter. But apparently he was not subjected to the more familiar indignities of abduction stories (especially from the US), such as bodily fluid samples and rectal probes. Although there were periods of missing memory, the hypnotic recall that did emerge was a curious hybrid of mythic images, UFO case elements and dream like sequences. When asked his opinion as to the reality status of this hypnotic testimony, Alan Godfrey was refreshingly honest. He told me he was certain that the UFO encounter was real, but he could not determine whether the story offered by hypnosis was a dream, a fantasy, reality, or a mixture of all three. Unhappily, Alan Godfrey suffered terribly after this encounter. When I first wrote up the investigation (just before the regression hypnosis began) for Flying Saucer Review magazine in l981, I deliberately changed his identity to help protect him; although this was probably futile because the story had already been featured in the local press under Godfrey\'s real name. However, despite my refusal to assist them, a tabloid reporter traced the witness and devoted a front-page banner headline article to the story — read by millions over the Sunday lunch—which led to the officer being called to explain himself before his superiors. He was forced to undergo medical investigation to determine his ""status"", but was pronounced psychologically fit and healthy. Yet after some years feeling that he would never be allowed to forget his sighting, he took advice to honorably resign over an unrelated physical injury incurred during an incident in which he bravely intervened to avert a crime. Todmorden, both before 1980 and in the years since, has been a hotbed of alien contact activity with several other major encounters having been investigated, including another abduction of a truck driver from Burnley Road only a little further out of Todmorden and on the same highway. written by... Jenny Randles ', 'September 30, 1980 -  Australian Cattle Rancher Encounters Bizarre UFO In the early morning of September 30, 1980, near Rosedale, Victoria,  an Australian cattle rancher was awoken by the sound of his frightened cattle. When he went outside, he was astonished to see a domed disc-shaped object with orange and blue lights,  gliding about ten feet above the ground. It rose slightly in the air, hovered briefly above an open 10,000 gallon water tank, and then landed fifty feet away.The rancher jumped on his motorbike and sped towards the object, which was making a ""whistling"" sound. Suddenly an ""awful scream"" sounded as a black tube extended from the UFO\'s base. With an ear-splitting bang, the strange craft rose into the air. A blast of air knocked the rancher down.The sounds ceased as the object slowly moved to a position about 30 feet away and 8 feet above the ground. Hovering briefly, it dropped debris - stones, weeds, cow dung - from underneath it, then flew away,  disappearing in the east.A ring of black flattened grass 30 feet in diameter marked the place where the disc had landed. When he examined it in the daylight, the witness discovered that all the yellow flowers within the circle had been removed. Only green grass remained. But one a more bizarre note,  the water tank was empty, with no evidence of spillage. Only the muddy residue at the bottom of the tank was left-and it had been pulled into a two foot high cone shape. The witness was sick with headaches and nausea for more than a week afterward.A similar ring was found the following December at Bundalaguah, not far from Rosedale. The water in a nearby reservoir was also mysteriously missing.source:http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/AndyPage/rosedale.htm', 'Continue with  Rendlesham Forest Landing, Chapter 2The spectacular events of late 1980 were kept out of the public knowledge for the most part, at least until 1983. An early UFO magazine article about the events brought only a passing interest, yet the story survived on rumor and speculation until Robert Todd of the Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS) secured a copy of an official report of the events through the Freedom of Information Act in 1983. The paper was dated 1-13-81, and had been sent to the British Ministry of Defense by Halt. The events of Rendlesham have been published in numerous newspapers, magazine articles, and several television shows, including ""Unsolved Mysteries,"" ""Sightings,"" and the British program ""Strange But True,"" among others.The case, in some respects, is similar to the famous Roswell, New Mexico incident in that its investigation involved almost exclusively military personnel. Though the two incidents occurred in totally different countries, both involved United States manned installations, and were close to top secret military bases.  ']"
1978, ,"[' Alien Being Shot Dead by MPs, January 18, 1978 (Ft. Dix & McGuire)More Information: The additional information that follows is taken from the  MUFON Symposium Proceedings, ""THE FATAL ENCOUNTER AT FT. DIX-McGUIRE: A CASE STUDY; Status Report IV."" Copyright ® 1985 by Leonard H. Springfield.Additional details about the case came by phone conversation and letter exchange between Springfield and Morse based on specific questions by Springfield. Description of the Humanoid: At varying times during his patrol duty, Morse was within 40 to 70 feet from the prostrate body on the abandoned runway #5. Never close enough to observe details such as facial features, or its hands and feet, he did recall that, under the glare of truck headlights, the skin of the unclad, hairless body was wet, shiny, and snake-like. As reported in his initial letter, the entity was about 4 feet in height with large head, slender torso, thin arms and legs, and overall, of grayish-brown coloration. Unquestionably not human, it was however of humanoid stature, fitting the anatomical description so often heard from military sources who have made claim to having seen entities at crash sites and as defined, coincidentally, by a medical source who allegedly performed an autopsy on a specimen in the early 1950\'s. Always pressing for more detail, I once proffered the notion that the McGuire corpse could have been that of a wild animal, a deer perhaps or an escaped ape from a military experimentation lab, or a zoo. To this Morse replied, ""No zoo nearby. We did have a problem with deer on the runway, but no one ever made such a big fuss over a deer."" The only other anomaly that Morse attributed to the presence of the body was the strong smell of ammonia in the cold night air, and, I note here that the same odor has been present at other crash sites. The Retrieval Operation. It was maximum security, said Morse who, alone, in his patrol car, received word by radio that a state of alert was in effect at McGuire as a result of the shooting incident. He was ordered to Gate #5 to answer the request of a state police officer who had been ""running code"" with the MP during his encounter at Ft. Dix and wanted admission to the airbase. Morse was ordered to ""comply,"" but when the trooper wanted to get closer to the runway he was not allowed to do so, and he was angry. On orders by radio, Morse was told that all personnel - including he and other members of his security police unit - were restricted from entry into the roped-off zone. Taking command was a new and unfamiliar team of Blue Berets that suddenly descended onto the scene, just moments after the runway had been cordoned off. With speed and efficiency ""they took over"" he said, ""and when asked who they were we were told nothing and ordered to stay outside the ropes."" Perplexed by this covert action, he noted that all of them were staff sergeants and up, wearing fatigues without patches or insignia. And for headgear, he said, ""they wore blue berets just like mine."" In one letter Morse vaguely speculated they were ""undercover cops"" and, by phone, he said he felt certain ""they"" were stationed somewhere at McGuire to account for their quick deployment to the runway. In support of this, when asked if helicopters were seen or heard overhead or landed on or near the scene, his reply was negative. This, it seems, would rule out any notion that they had been transported from an outside base. It also strengthened his belief, and mine, that a UFO had not crashed or been disabled nearby requiring close tactical air support. But, what of a landed craft, perhaps one that touch-landed earlier at Ft. Dix? Could it have deployed one or more of its kind to perform a duty, forever unknown, at one or both of the adjoining military installations? The book, ""Clear Intent"" by Lawrence Fawcett & Barry Greenwood (Prentice-Hall, 1984) relates many reports of UFO surveillance over airbases in 1975-76 and I know of many more hidden under the lid of secrecy. At McGuire, once the sensitive area had been roped off and ECP (Entry Control Point) established, a generator unit was brought in for better lighting. At least a dozen men, said Morse, armed with M-l6\'s were assigned to guard at the ropes and no one was allowed to enter except the base commander, the security police squadron commander, 1st Lt. WS of the security police squadron, and a base photographer. While on patrol, Morse watched the Blue Beret specialists spray the corpse from a portable tank and cover it with a white sheet. Before daybreak the body was carefully placed onto a platform and a wooden frame built around it. This was finally placed into a large square silver metal container, about 10 x 10 feet with undistinguishable blue markings Before going off duty, Morse and others watched the silver box fork-lifted into a C-141 which arrived about 7 a.m. from Wright-Patterson AFB (identified by special markings) and, later, at a distance he said he watched the plane and its secret cargo soar aloft into limbo, presumed destination, Dayton, Ohio. For Sgt. Morse and others of the Blue Beret regulars at McGuire, it was far from over when the C-141, with corpse, took off. Two days later he and three others he named were also on a C-141 on orders to report to Wright-Patterson, the base of many sancta. The setting at Wright-Patterson was like that of a court martial, a table and chairs in an unadorned room which Morse describes as follows: ""While there we were all together except for actual interrogations. Mine had two men, one apparently a civilian with pipe and beard who never spoke. At one point there were three men. One played nice guy, one mean guy, and, of course, the silent civilian. All they wanted to know was the nature of the incident, what I knew and then told me about my duty to keep my mouth shut... I signed a form and it is supposed to bind me for life.""   Never once, as Morse recalls, did any of the interrogators offer information or an explanation of the incident. Nor did anyone ever refer to the retrieved dead body or suggest that it may have been of extraterrestrial origin. Said Morse, ""they beat around the bush, all references to it were indirect."" The day after the interrogation, Morse returned to McGuire, was debriefed by his Commanding Officer, Lt. Col. FM, and released for normal duty. The incident, he said, was not discussed again by anyone as though it never happened. Latest Information:This last section compiled by Springfield / HallThe former Air Force security policeman who claims to have witnessed a UFO incident on January 18, 1978, involving military police at McGuire AFB, New Jersey and adjacent Fort Dix, and New Jersey State Police, recently visited the Washington, D.C., area from overseas, where he is employed and met with the authors. The Fund for UFO Research sponsored a mini-conference to bring Stringfield from Cincinnati, Ohio, and have representatives of the Fund meet  the witness to form their own impressions of his credibility.  The Fund-sponsored mini-conference took place on January 24, 1987, at a large shopping mall in the Washington, D.C., area suburbs. In addition to the authors and Morse, Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee (Chairman of the Fund) and William H. Hall (electronics engineer and brother of Richard) were present. Dr. John B Carlson, Univ. of Maryland astronomer and Fund Board Member, was to have been present, but a postponement caused a schedule conflict and he was out of town on the date of the conference.  William Hall. a former technical consultant to the National Investigations Committee an Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), substituted since he had a number of things in common with Morse (including military police background and overseas duty stations) and would be able to judge Morse\'s credibility as he talked about his activities .  By prior arrangement Morse remained incognito, using only his first name, but talked freely and responded to questions by Maccabee and William Hall. (The authors know his full name, employment status, past biography, etc.) During the questioning and review of the alleged incident, Morse filled in details that were missing from his previous account, but offered no startling new information. A number of questions were clarified, and some new information (including claims that can be checked and proved or disproved) were offered. However, the authors were again impressed by Morse\'s straight forwardness and lack of embellishment.  The most significant new information related by Morse, briefly, was his claim that on a trip to the United States to visit his family in October 1986 he had been ""detained,"" while in California, under obscure pretenses. Outraged, he filed a lawsuit against the California-based authority and notified Stringfleld by letter that he would return to the United States in January 1987 for court appearances and, at that time would be willing to meet him and Dick Hall and a couple other well-trusted friends to discuss the matter. But, during Morse\'s layover in the States he could learn nothing about the cause or reason for his detainment, nor the identity of the source who dictated the ""pick up and hold"" order. His legal probes, for some inexplicable reason, had been stalled in a tangle of red tape.  Among other things discussed at the mini-conference was the entire question of alleged harassment of UFO crash/retrieval witnesses, apparently in an attempt to intimidate them into silence. If Morse\'s story is credible, he is potentially an important witness who would tend to undermine the official cover-up. Unfortunately, this makes him vulnerable to retaliation (which may account for his detainment) and inhibits his ability to lead a normal life.  Skepticism about crash/retrieval reports may be fully justified and entirely understandable on the part of UFO ""believers"" and ""disbelievers"" alike unless they have met Jeff Morse or one of his many counterparts face-to-face. Morse has now provided many additional leads that we intend to check, and we will report our findings objectively as new information is obtained.  Meanwhile, the authenticity of the ""Incident Report"" form Morse supplied to Stringfleld (reproduced in the MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium Proceedings), obtained from a colleague still on active duty, has been disputed by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) on the grounds that the style and terminology used ""allegedly"" does not follow proper Air Force style and is therefore probably a hoax. One of the key statements made by AFOSI was that pay grades (E-2, E-3...) were given instead of ranks (Corporal, Sergeant...) on the official form.  Aside from the fact that Morse has claimed all along that this was a rough draft ""back room"" copy subject to review and revision, and that minor errors would be corrected by responsible officials before the final report was filed, the AFOSI statement is inaccurate. Pay grades, rather than ranks, are routinely filed in official Air Force reports. Participants of the mini-conference discussed ways of obtaining additional confirmation of the reported 1978 event, and various initiatives will be undertaken to do so. As a result of the mini-conference, two additional persons (B. Maccabee and W. Hall) now have met and talked with Morse and can confirm that he is not a ""fairy tale"" or a figment of the imagination. They are also now in a position to help confirm or disconfirm his story.  See official documents  relating to the Fort Dix, McGuire AFB Case. Article arranged, edited for the UFO Casebook by B J Booth', 'The New Zealand UFO / Airplane Encounter of December, 1978Startup then turned the plane completely around once more and the object was not visible but Wellington control maintained that its echo was still evident on radar. As the Argosy approached Christchurch, the fuel gauge went haywire but apparently this was not necessarily something unusual and they tuned in on the UFO off Banks Peninsular.  Wellington control now had the object on radar while the aircraft landed at Christchurch.    At 2-15 a.m. 31st December, the aircraft set off on a return flight and very quickly two strange objects came into view. Crockett observed one of the objects through his camera and described a spinning sphere with lateral lines around it and one of the objects appeared on the aircraft\'s radar for four minutes.  As the aircraft approached the end of its flight, two pulsating lights were observed - one suddenly falling for about 1,000 feet before eventually stopping in a series of jerky movements.   The presence of this object was confirmed by Wellington air traffic control. The resultant film taken during these two flights was shown all over the world - the BBC giving it priority on the main evening news programme.  Despite the fact that the filmed events were also evident on ground based radar, sceptics were driven to extreme and strange lengths to explain the filmed evidence, including the lights from shrimp boats, top secret U.S. remote controlled planes etc. It should be noted that the Royal New Zealand Air Force was so concerned about the event that Skyhawk jet fighters had been put on full alert in order to intercept the UFOs. Following the broadcasting of the film by the B.B.C. and the subsequent investigation, the Daily Telegraph (U.K. newspaper - noted for businesslike and scientific observations) remarked:""The scientist who suggested that all (on the aircraft) were seeing Venus on a particularly bright night can be safely consigned to Bedlam (insane asylum)!<!--google_ad_client = ""pub-7518747415195612"";/* 728x90, created 7/4/08 */google_ad_slot = ""5690704701"";google_ad_width = 728;google_ad_height = 90;//-->', '1978 - Octagon UFO Reported over Watford City, North DakotaFair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

Coming face-to-face with a UFO creates vivid memories.Amparano\'s sighting is one of the most detailed of the manyaccounts of UFO sightings in the Fresno area documented over theyears in The Fresno Bee and on Web sites.The Fresno resident was working as a Kerman police officer.""It was just a routine patrol,"" Amparano says of the encounter24 years ago.His early morning sweep took him past Kerman High School. At DelNorte and California avenues, Amparano saw ""a circular-typething, similar to a round fireball or a setting sun, about 100to 150 feet off the ground.""He knew local teens had been setting palm trees on fire, and hethought he had caught some young vandals red-handed.""Then I realized there were no palm trees in the area. The fireseemed to be inside of an oak or maple tree. This thing startedlifting up,"" Amparano says.The officer started adjusting the spotlight on his patrol car toget a better look at the object. But just before he turned onthe light, there was a bright blue flash. Then the object made asharp turn and moved away toward the southwest at a rapid speed.Amparano had not left his car. And the windows were rolled upbecause it was a cold evening. He did not hear any other noiseexcept for the engine of his car.The Air National Guard, weather bureau and the Fresno AirTerminal told Amparano nothing unusual showed up on any of theirradar screens that night. The encounter might have beendismissed as an optical illusion, if not for the burns Amparanosuffered on his face and chest.""It was like a sunburn when you fall asleep at the pool. Therewere white blisters on the parts of my body facing that light. Ialso had trouble with sunlight. It was like right after you haveyour eyes checked and they are sensitive to light. That lastedabout a week,"" Amparano says.Doctors at Fresno Community Hospital told Amparano the burnsappeared to be caused by microwaves.An immediate search of the cotton field where the sphere hadbeen sighted revealed no evidence. But for years, nothing wouldgrow in a round area in the field. Today the spot is part of analmond orchard.Amparano went back to work a few days later. The only after-affect of the close encounter was calls from ""a lot of women whowanted to have lunch and dinner with me."" He continued to workin local law enforcement until 1992, when he was hurt whilebreaking up a bar fight.He\'s had more than two decades to think about that glowingsphere. Amparano is certain it was a UFO.""What I am not certain about is whether it was some kind ofgovernment project or something from out there,"" Amparano says.written by Rick BentleySource & References:http://www.fresnobee.com/lifestyle/story/5440245p-6425488c.html(Published Monday, December 2, 2002, 5:55 AM)', '1978 The Cullen Abduction(The 9th Alleged ET Implant Removal By Dr. Roger Leir & Team)Tim Cullen is a hard working cement contractor from Yuma, Colorado. He was raised there, and resides with his wife Janet, and three daughters. Three things happened to Cullen in 1978 that changed his life forever. He suffered a terrible car accident, saw his first UFO, and suddenly realized that both events had appeared to him in dreams well before the actual occurrences. Was he then also psychic? ""The events that have happened to me over the past twenty-seven years have had an enormous effect on my life and what I believe,"" Cullen, a practicing Catholic, told me. ""In a short span of time in 1978 it was revealed to me that we are not the only intelligent life in the universe, and it was also proven to me that God is with us always, without a doubt."" On April 2, 1978 Tim Cullen dreamed that he was in a terrible car accident. On April 9, 1978, he and his friend Ken Ruberg, were driving on Highway 34 when Tim realized he was living out his dream.""I thought about stopping and going back to townbut didn\'t,"" Tim said. Seconds later, he rolled the car five times, breaking his neck on the first roll. Ruberg helped Cullen up out of the ditch, and waved down a passing station wagon. They took Cullen to the nearest hospital. The event was a replay of his dream. While in the hospital, under sedation, Cullen dreamed of an encounter with a UFO. Returning home from a medical check-up in Denver on May 30, 1978, Tim and his wife Janet, a registered nurse, were driving north on Highway 59 near the Vernon Road junction (about a quarter mile north of it).It was dark, after 11:00pm at night. Tim saw a large dimly lit object pass in front of the car, go behind a low hill, and re-emerge then, ""It went out a ways, along side, and as I brought the car down to a stop, it came back toward us a bit. I backed the car up, and the UFO went out to the west of us. It came in under the power and telephone lines and hovered over a pasture. ""It was about a hundred foot long and twenty foot wide, and about ten foot high,"" Cullen relates. ""It didn\'t make any noise. There were two diffused lights that shone at the back of the craft, one a light yellow, and the other red. We couldn\'t see very good. We sat there and stared at it for awhile. After we looked at the two lights for a few minutes I turned to my wife and told her we might as well go on to town."" Janet was five months pregnant with their first child. The Cullens have no memory of being taken aboard the craft, nor of any missing time. ""Now, when I think about it, when I turned and started driving, I did have an odd feeling, but it didn\'t really register with me. I remember coming back to Yuma, but not looking at a clock. I was kind of shocked by the whole thing. I didn\'t really think of looking at a clock,"" Cullen said. Twenty years later in 1998, while setting rebar at a job, Tim Cullen hit his thumb with a hammer. Sometime later, he thought the finger might be dislocated so he went to see Dr. Mark Hubner at the Yuma Clinic. The doctor suggested they take an X-ray. On returning with the film, Dr. Hubner asked, ""Did you know you have a piece of metal in your arm?"" At that moment, Tim Cullen knew what the object was. He knew that he and Janet had experienced missing time on May 30, 1978. In 1980, Cullen experienced another encounter, at exactly the same spot! The craft hovered and two diffused yellow lights came on. Then one started blinking, and he stared at it. ""This can\'t be happening!"" he thought. ""Not right here!"" The craft kept moving in back of, and out from behind a low hill. Then it moved slowly away from him. Figuring they didn\'t want him to see them, he got back in the car and returned to Yuma. Again, in 1994, with his wife and three daughters, they encountered a smaller craft with a strobe light, about forty miles south of Yuma. ""It hovered off the road in front of us, and we stopped and looked at it for five to ten minutes. It moved around for awhile and finally went off to the north,"" Cullen related. ""The girls seemed mystified by it, but they were younger and I don\'t really think they realized the enormity of what they were seeing."" Tim didn\'t think much about UFOs or abduction before his experiences, and had never heard about Alien implants. But after seeing the X-ray, and knowing where the object in the film came from, he started exploring the Internet about the subject of UFOs and abduction. He joined an on-line encounter group, and learned about a man in California, Dr. Roger K. Leir, who removed what were reported to be ""Alien Implants"". He and Leir communicated for over a year. The ninth alleged alien implant was surgically removed from the left forearm of Tim Cullen on Saturday, February 5, 2000. The operation was performed at a medical facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The procedure was performed by a surgical team led by Dr Roger Leir; the surgery by Dr. John D, Matrisciano. ""I know nothing about UFOs or implants,"" Dr. Matrisciano said after the operation, ""but I think that\'s what is needed in this case; to be objective."" Removal of the small, ""melon seed"" type implant went very quickly, and smoothly. The operation was videotaped by The Learning Channel for an upcoming show. Recently, at a MUFON Board meeting, I saw videotape of the object that was removed, which was shot through a microscope. The object was about 7 centimeters long and 4 centimeters wide. It is covered by an amazing reddish-brown membrane and has several long, proceptors (which were connected to nerve endings) on one end. A dark area reveals a metal core. When a magnet was placed a half-inch from the object, it literally leapt to the magnet! As yet, the object has not been sent to anyone for analysis. An appropriate laboratory is being sought, as are funds for performing various tests of the object. Tim Cullen has become very outspoken about his experiences and about the object that was recently removed from his arm. Unlike others who have had implants removed, Tim has allowed his name to be used in the press, has given out his phone number, and has recently established an Email address: ufogoat_2000@yahoo.com. On returning to Yuma, Colorado after the implant removal, Cullen told his story to Yuma\'s local paper, The Yuma Pioneer, and addressed both the congregations of his Catholic Church, and his wife\'s Presbyterian Church. He has also been on the Art Bell Dreamland show with Dr. Roger Leir and host Whitley Streiber. While at one of the church presentations a woman reached out and touched Tim\'s sleeve. ""My husband and I know exactly what you\'ve been through,"" she told him. Tim plans to talk with them. Another man E-mailed Tim and told him of an experience he had had. Many have come forward with stories since his return from the implant removal.""A lot of people around here have seen strange lights in the skies,"" Cullen reports. ""Yuma is an agricultural area. They raise a lot of corn, pigs, and cattle here. Many of the ranchers have reported cattle mutilations, several within the last few months. One lost a prize bull. Understandably, the ranchers are angered and frustrated about these events. They don\'t understand why they happen. Tim doesn\'t like not being able to remember what happened to him when the object was planted in his wrist. He is considering going through hypnotic regression in California to see if his subconscious can reveal any answers, as it has in others. He now admits he thinks he has been abducted. Why is he being so open? Analyses from seven of the eight other implants removed have shown that the membrane surrounding the metal objects seems to keep them protected from foreign object rejection. ""This could be a huge medical breakthrough for doctors who want to use biological, metal, or implants of other materials, in their patients. Several prestigious labs have chemically broken down the make-up of the membrane. With the proper research, funded by large pharmaceutical companies, human body rejection of such implants could save many lives in the future,"" Cullen said. ""I\'m coming forward because someone has to put a face to the alien stories, and cause more people to come forward,"" Tim Cullen told the Pioneer. ""The more people we can find with implants, the more evidence we\'re going to have. We can study things a lot more and get things done; get rid of the stigma around it."" Tim Cullen says proudly.

Near Alicante, Spain-  Date: July 5 1978 Time: 0230A  Businessman Pablo R. was returning from a late meeting on an isolated curvy road when he sees an intense light up ahead and immediately thinks it is another vehicle with its high beams on. Suddenly the light is hidden behind a hill and moments later it again re-emerges, still shiningintensively.   He was surprised at the shade of light which was\'nt whitebut very bright onange in color. The light disappeared againat a curve and then it appeared again, this time very closeto the witness. The witness then slowed down in order to see the light better.   At this point he realizes that the light is shaped like adisc and is huge. The huge bright orange disc was on the left side of the road. The witness then decided to accelerate his car and drive away from the area as quickly as possible. But at that same instant the orange light dimmed and at the same time the car engine began sputtering,his headlights shut off and the car came to a complete stopin the middle of complete darkness. He came to a stop and could not see anything around him, even the orange light was now gone.   Moments later Pablo heard a strange voice calling his name from the darkness. Terrified he began to tremble, it was the only time when he felt fear thinking that he was going to be a victim of highway robbery. But suddenly he realized that the voice was calling him by his name, he thought that it must be someone he knew and in the darknesshe now could see a tall, human like figure, about 1.80m in height, maybe taller.   The figure wore a tight-fitting semi-transparent coverall,which the witness thought was strange since it was very hot.The figure\'s face was normal in appearance except for large luminous slightly slanted eyes. Immediately the witness felta sense of peace and tranquility as he and the stranger established a telepathic conversation. Using the telepathythe tall figure confirmed to the witness that he was indeedan extraterrestrial and meant him no harm and was on earth on a peace mission.   The extraterrestrial told the witness that earth scientists did not know about his planet since it was in a ""dark zone"" in which telescopes or other types of equipment were unable to reach. He added that using our fastest spaceships it would take humans hundreds of years to reach his planet using our outdated technology"". They traveled using a concept that did not deal with speed or distance and was totally incomprehensible to current earthphysics.   The surprised witness then pointed out that the visitor was indeed human in appearance; the extraterrestrial smiledslightly and said, ""Of course, in our planets we are all humans just like you. There are certain anatomical differences but they are slight. However what makes us much difference from earthlings is not the physical matter but the inequality of our evolutions, first mental and then astral and spiritually."" The extraterrestrial added that humans were still evolving in the ""physical plane"" but were in the brink in initiating a mental and astral evolution and then spiritual evolution which will change humanity forever. But he then added that we were still a long way from this threshold.  The witness then asked if there were other different extraterrestrial civilizations, the stranger said, ""Of course there are, many come in peace others to observe andothers are not our friends, since the forces of evil and good exist throughout the cosmos.  Later the extraterrestrial added rather cryptically, ""I am authorized to answer most of your questions, you see my contact with you was very carefully planned, take it with calm, remember the time factor doesn\'t matter, this exchange will take only a few minutes of your time, you can ask all the questions you like, if they are concrete Iwill attempt to answer them.  The witness then went on to ask numerous questions, like why they didn\'t pick some important politician to contact, the extraterrestrial told him that politicians were not in their interest since they did not act in a spiritual manner.He added that his planet was governed by a council consisting of their most adept and intelligent of their species, it was sort of a one planetary government. The witness then asked if they believed in God, the extraterrestrial said ""Yes but we discard the anthropomorphic concept which humans developed. He then insisted that the witness did not ask any more questionsabout God since he was too high up to talk about him. He then added that humans only needed to ""love"" God.   The witness then asked which planets in our solar systemhad life, the answer was that eons ago there had been life on Venus, Mars and even on our moon. There still remain many hidden bases on those planets some of which have beendetected by our astronauts and kept secret.   The stranger also added that there was an advanced civilization on Jupiters moon Ganymede, which was similar to that of Earths and was striving to make contact with humans. He also added that Neptune contained a ""hidden"" civilization which was impossible for humans to see.  There were countless inhabited worlds in the known universe which they knew, they had counted more than 120,000so far, many less advanced than that of the human civilization.   The witness then asked the inevitable question, ""What happens when we die? The answer was surprising, There is no absolute death. The different religions on your planetexplain it very capably, although with essential differences. The witness then asked, Who was Jesus Christ, the answer, ""Somebody who you have not yet totally understood? How can we understand him better? asked the witness. Just try to understand this; his main message wasone, ""LOVE"", which is the way, the spiritual way, was the answer.   The visitor then added, humanity should not fear us, theyshould only fear themselves, thats were the danger lies. At this point the witness insisted in a clarification of the statement but the visitor remained silent.   Upon asking if there were extraterrestrials of differenceappearance from that of humans, the visitor said, that evolution has not been equal throughout the Universe and there exists some marked differences in some species.   The visitor then spoke about his home planet, ""Our planethas been inhospitable for thousands of years now. A thick slab of ice several kilometers thick covers it. But our ancestors managed to survive and under extreme hardshipsovercame the abstractness of matter and cosmic evolution, in that way we have been able to build vast gardens on theice and build huge underground cities, in which there exists neither heat nor cold"". Their main source of energywas a white form of cosmic energy which they called Abuchal.  Finally the witness asked the visitor his name, ""My name is Naazra-Abuc. I am the second in command of the craft thatyou have seen. Forgive us for disabling your vehicles electrical system, it is a simple method which earthling will soon learn how to use."" The witness said that no one will believe his story, but was told by the visitor that only he had to believe it.   Moments later the figure disappeared into the darkness andminutes later the witness saw a large luminous disc rise into the sky and disappear to the witness. The witness\' vehicle then started and he noticed that it was now only 0233 AM.source and references:Source: Manuel Nava Arcos, Los Grandes ContactadosComments: Translated by Albert S. Rosales', 'Australian Pilot Frederick Valentich Disappears1978 - Boats and aircraft found no trace of the 20-year-old Australian pilot who disappeared with his plane on Saturday night after radioing that he was being chased by a UFO.Frederick Valentich was on a 125 mile training flight in his single engine Cessna 182 along the coast of Bass Strait when he told air traffic controllers in Melbourne that he was being buzzed by a UFO with 4 bright lights about 1000 feet above him.Controllers said his last message was taped and was: ""It\'s approaching from due east towards me. It seems to be playing some sort of game... flying at a speed I can\'t estimate. It\'s not an aircraft. It\'s... It is flying past. It is a long shape. I cannot identify more than that. It\'s coming for me right now.""A minute later: ""It seems to be stationary. I\'m also orbiting and the thing is orbiting on top of me also. It has a green light and a sort of metallic light on the outside.""Valentich then radioed that his engine was running roughly.His last words were: ""It is not an aircraft.""The Australian Air Force said it had received 11 reports from people along the coast who said they saw UFOs on Saturday night, but the Transport Department was skeptical.Ken Williams, a spokesman for the department, said, ""It\'s funny all these people ringing up with UFO reports well after Valentich\'s disappearance. It seems people often decide after the event, they too had seen strange lights. But although we can\'t take them too seriously, we can never discourage such reports when investigating a plane\'s disappearance.""Some Transport Dept officials have speculated that Valentich became disoriented and saw his own lights reflected in the water, or lights from a nearby island, while flying upside down.Frederick Valentich by plane Valentich\'s father, Guio, said his son used to study UFOs ""as a hobby using information he had received from the Air Force. He was not the kind of person who would make up stories. Everything had to be very correct and positive for him.""The fact that they have found no trace of him really verifies the fact that UFOs could have been there.""Guio Valentich said he hoped his son hadn\'t crashed but had been taken by a UFO.Editors Note: It is a total misconception that UFO reports were only made after Valentich\'s report. According to the Victorian UFO Research Society, based at Moorabbin, near the location from where the disappearance took place, there had been a UFO wave ongoing for at least six weeks before the date of Valentich\'s disappearance.ACTUAL TRANSCRIPTION OF MELBOURNE FLIGHT SERVICEThe transcript portion of the communication between Valentich and Melbourne Flight Service as released by the Australian Department of Transport follows: (FS - Flight Service, DSJ - Frederick Valentich aircraft designation).1906:14 DSJ Melbourne, this is Delta Sierra Juliet.

Hallstrom of Oxnard, California. Hallstrom had been flying for 37 years, 1712 hours as a Navy combat air crewman and personal crew chief to admirals, including the Commander-in-Chief of the Atlantic Fleet.   Hallstrom had left Oxnard at about 12:35 PM, in a Cessna 170A bound to San Diego via Los Angeles, following a friend, Jim Victor, who was delivering another plane to a customer at Brown Field, San Diego. The plan was for him to transport Victor back to Oxnard after the delivery. The two kept in touch by radio.   As Hallstrom approached Santa Monica at 7,500 feet altitude, the sky was clear except for a smog layer in the vicinity of Los Angeles International Airport. ""At this time I was looking for Jim straight ahead,"" Hallstrom reported, ""when I spotted [the UFO] just on the edge of the haze area above LAX [Los Angeles International Airport] slightly to the east side... I thought it was Jim so I watched it for about a minute because he had just given me his position report, but it seemed to get larger and coming toward me so I naturally realized that it wasn\'t Jim...   ""I started looking to see what it was, but I could see no wings on this aircraft although at this time I could see windows which appeared to be passenger windows in the aircraft. ""As it drew nearer though, I was able to determine that there were no wings or horizontal empennage assembly to the aircraft as a conventional aircraft...""   Hallstrom began wondering if it was some kind of helicopter, but it was approaching at high speed. As the UFO passed about 6,000 feet to his left, he was looking down on it an angle of about 30-45 degrees. Then the true form suddenly became clear to him. There were no rotors, no tail assembly.   ""All of a sudden, I was able to make out the complete form of a saucer shape or round object... I could see the dome, also very vividly clear, including all the windows... ""[I] observed it to be of a very bright metal... it was more of a nickel or highly polished chrome or stainless steel type of metal than aluminum, because it had more of a mellow glow than [if] it was of the type finish on a high finish aluminum.""   About 16 to 20 evenly spaced windows were visible around the circumference of the dome, located just above the base. The dome appeared to be a perfect hemisphere about 20 feet in diameter resting on the base which was about 30 feet in diameter. The UFO continued on a course of about 310 degrees (opposite to Hallstrom\'s course) with no sign of rotation, oscillation, pitch, roll, or yaw. Neither was there any sign of a propulsion system. The sun reflected off the dome as a bright spot as the UFO passed. After about a minute the object disappeared from view behind the Cessna. Hallstrom estimated its speed at about 650 mph. He quickly took notes and made a sketch of the UFO.   Reaching for his radio microphone, he first called Jim Victor to report what he had seen. Then he notified various FAA authorities.   Hallstrom, who was shaken by the sighting, later had troubling dreams, mostly about UFOs and aliens. He had not taken the subject seriously up to this time, but the implications of what he had seen struck home to him. He later reported that the experience had altered his entire life.

The incident began with a phone call from a civilian. At about 10:05 PM, she called from nearby Silver Glen Springs to ask if the installation was shooting off flares. She had just seen something that looked like a flare. The duty officer, SK-1 Robert Clark, assured her no such operation was going on at that moment. A second call came a few minutes later. A man, later identified as Rocky Morgan, said that he and seven other persons traveling on Highway 19 near Silver Glen Springs had just seen an oblong-shaped flying object, some 50 to 60 feet in diameter and ""almost the color of the moon,"" pass over the top of his car. It had a flashing light which was intensely bright at its center. Clark checked with the Jacksonville Air Route Traffic Control Center, which told him no aircraft were in the area. He and the base air controller, Gary Collison, climbed up an observation tower next to a van containing the base\'s radar equipment. Clark contacted external security and directed them to contact TD-2 Timothy Collins, a radar technician. Collins rushed to the tower. The personnel already there were watching a cluster of glowing lights off to the west-northwest. They were at eye-level and seemed to be just above an old Civil Defense tower three miles away. Even though it was a clear, quiet night, the witnesses heard no noise emanating from the lights, which apparently were attached to a single object. After watching them through binoculars, Collins went down to warm up the track radar, which took five minutes, and the acquisition radar, which took 20 minutes. As he waited, he looked for the object with a periscope on the van and saw it again. At around 11:20 radar locked on to the target. The object was located at 0.2 degrees elevation, or just a hundred or so feet off the ground, at the assumed distance: ""treetop level,"" Collins would say. Its image on radar was ""as strong [as] or stronger than"" the image of the tower. The object seemed to be the size of a jetliner. Ten to 15 minutes later it abruptly vanished from both sight and radar. But at around 11:40, the same or a similar object appeared 15 degrees to the north. Collins located it visually, but the second, computer-assisted radar did not track it for some reason. He also saw it through the periscope. A few minutes later it disappeared suddenly from both instrumented and visual observation. Around midnight it, or another object, was seen three miles to the northwest. For five seconds it moved at more than 500 knots on a course, then accelerated for two seconds, and executed a hairpin turn in one second. When it made that turn, it was 15 miles south of the base, which meant it had covered 15 miles in seven seconds; most of that distance was covered in the last two seconds (a speed of 7,700 mph is required to cover this distance in that time). The turn was a radical reversal of direction; now the UFO was shooting northward and toward the observers at the base. Its speed had slowed almost instantaneously to a mere two knots. It was at this point that Collins\' radar locked on to it. After a little more than a minute, the object vanished. The sighting was over. A dozen or so personnel had seen the object or objects. One of them, TD-AA Carol Snyder, told a newspaper reporter, ""We saw three very blurry lights: red, white, and green. We watched them for about 30 minutes. We couldn\'t see how fast they were traveling. We were holding the binoculars, and the lights appeared to be bouncing,"" The Navy conducted an investigation out of the Jacksonville center but came to no conclusions. Allan Hendry of the Center for UFO Studies interviewed several of the witnesses and gathered radar, meteorological, and astronomical data. He considered, then rejected, various prosaic alternatives before declaring this a CUFOS case of ""high merit.""

I was the watch tower guard that night, and there are some facts that were not mentioned. Such as that Jacksonville NAS launched 2 aircraft to intercept. Once they were on our radar, the UFO vanished.They had it locked into their radar as well. Our radar locked onto one of the UFOs. I have never seen a radar act so crazy. Spinning around and around, up and down. I just wanted to add my 2 cents worth due to the fact that I saw the UFO first from the tower. I and airman K.C. woke the Petty Officer of the day, and drug him up the tower to see what we saw. (before any calls were received).That night we were told not to talk to anyone about this by the commanding officer. I have told this story to many of my friends and they all thought I was crazy! I am sure you can check Navy records to confirm I truly was there!Thank youJohn Falkenhagensource:www.ufoskeptic.orgwww.ufocasebook.comEyewitness account, John Falkenhagen']"
1959, ,"['The Disappearance of Private IrwinOne of the strangest, most baffling cases in UFO folklore is the story of one Private First Class Gerry Irwin. On March 2, 1959, he awoke in Cedar City Hospital, and was completely unaware of how he got there. Irwin had been unconscious for twenty-three hours, and during that time was mumbling something about a ""jacket on the bush."" As he regained consciousness, the first thing he said was ""Were there any survivors?""The strange tale of Gerry Irwin came to my attention from the notes of James Lorenzen, who is the esteemed director of the APRO group. The facts will leave one puzzled, and if there was any type of investigation by the Armed Forces, those details remain hidden to this day.Irwin\'s story began on February 28, 1959, as he was driving from Nampa, Idaho back to Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas, where he was a Nike missile technician. Returning from a leave of absence, he reached Cedar City, Utah, and turned southeast on Route 14 when he saw an unusual sight. The landscape was brilliantly lit as he observed a glowing object, which crossed the sky from right to left in front of him. Startled, he left his car to get a better view, and watched the strange craft continue until it was blocked from his sight by a ridge. His first thoughts were that a large airplane was making a forced landing. Wanting to render aid if possible, Irwin quickly wrote a note, left it on his car, and headed in the direction of the supposed crash. The note said, ""HAVE GONE TO INVESTIGATE POSSIBLE PLANE CRASH. PLEASE CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS."" He attached the note to his steering wheel, and using shoe polish, wrote STOP on the side of his car.About 30 minutes later, a Fish and Game Inspector stopped at the sight of Irwin\'s note. He immediately took the note to the Cedar City Sheriff\'s Office. Sheriff Otto Pfief quickly organized a search party, and headed for the sight. Approximately an hour later, Irwin was found unconscious in the area, with no sign of a plane crash. Upon arriving at the hospital, he was examined by Dr. Broadbent, who found that although Irwin\'s temperature and respiration were normal, he could not be awakened. Broadbent\'s initial diagnosis was ""hysteria."" When the frightened Irwin did come to, he felt fine, but was still puzzled by the strange object he had seen. He also was at a loss as to where his jacket was, it not being on him when found by searchers.Irwin was flown back to Ft. Bliss, and put under observation at William Beaumont Hospital for four days. He returned to duty afterward, though his security clearance was withdrawn. A couple of days later, while walking at the base, he fainted. He recovered almost immediately, however. On March 15, he fainted again on an El Paso street, and was taken to Southwest General Hospital. His condition at this time was very similar to his state at Cedar City. Irwin awoke at 2:00 A.M. on Monday, and asked, ""Were there any survivors?"" He thought that it was February 28 again, and was shocked to be told it was some two weeks later. He was again taken to William Beaumont Hospital, and placed under observation in the psychiatric ward. After a month\'s stay, he was released, and deemed ""normal"" by Captain Valentine.The very next day, seemingly without provocation, the Private left the fort without leave, caught a bus in El Paso, and arrived in Cedar City on Sunday afternoon, April 19. Returning to the scene of his strange encounter, he headed straight to an area where he found his missing jacket. There was a pencil in a buttonhole with a piece of paper tightly wrapped around it. He took the paper and burned it, and seemingly came out of his trance. Irwin had trouble finding his way back to his car, and turned himself in to Sheriff Pfief, who refreshed his memory of his first incident. Jim and Coral Lorenzen, hearing of the strange case, contacted Irwin after he returned to Fort Bliss. He underwent another psychiatric examination, with the same results as the first. His case was reviewed by the Inspector General, who ordered a more complete examination. On July 10, Irwin again entered Beaumont Hospital. After being released, he did not report for duty on August 1. A month later, he was listed as AWOL. He has never been seen again. B J Booth', 'September 7, 1959 - Radar Confirmed ""Mushroom"" UFO Chased By Fighters On September 24, 1959, just before dawn, police officer Robert Dickerson was cruising the city streets in his patrol car when he noticed a bright falling object like a meteor. But instead of ""burning out,"" the object took on a larger, ball-like appearance, stopped abruptly, and hovered about 200 feet above the ground. Its glow lit up juniper trees below it.   The patrolman watched the UFO for several minutes, then drove toward it on Prineville Highway, turning in at the airport. The UFO, meanwhile changed color from bright white to a duller reddish-orange color, and dived rapidly to a new position NE of the airport.     The object flew over Redmond Airport, situated southeast of the city of Portland and hovered over the field, where it was observed for several minutes by FAA officials.     At the FAA office, Flight Service Specialist Laverne Wertz had just completed making weather observations minutes before, and had seen nothing unusual. Now Patrolman Dickerson, Wertz, and others studied the hovering object through binoculars. The UFO was round and flat, with tongues of ""flame"" periodically extending from the rim.     At 1310Z (5:10 am. PST) official logs show, the UFO was reported to Seattle Air Route Control Center. Logs of the Seattle center show that the report was relayed to Hamilton AFB. The Seattle log continues:     ""UFO also seen on the radar at Klamath Falls GCI [Ground Control Intercept] site. F-102\'s scrambled from Portland.""     Six F-102 fighters were scrambled from Portland. As they took off, the Air Force radioed the pilots of a B-47 bomber and a F-89 fighter on routine flights nearby, ordering them to join the chase.     As the Redmond Observers studied the UFO, they noticed a high speed aircraft approaching from the southwest. The Redmond log continues:     ""As aircraft approached, UFO took shape of mushroom, observed long yellow and red flame from lower side as UFO rose rapidly and disappeared above-clouds.""     The UFO was seen again briefly, hovering about 25 miles south of the airport. Radar continued to show the UFO south of Redmond for about two hours, at various altitude changing from 5.000 feet to 52.000 feet.   sources/references http://www.chez.com/lesovnis/htm/redmond59.htm Portland Oregon Air Traffic Controller report', 'The Papua, New Guinea Sightings (1) 1959According to renowned UFO investigator, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, one of the most well-documented ""close encounters of the third kind"" occurred in the Anglican mission village at Boianai, Papua, New Guinea, which was, at the time of the incident, still a territory of Australia.The Australian Anglican Church was very involved in missionary work, and ardent in sending its heralds to the island nation.One of these was the Father William Booth Gill.Gill was highly thought of by his co-hearts, and all those who knew him. As far as the occurrence of extraordinary events was concerned, Gill was skeptical, to say the least, especially being a devoted Church worker.The first hint of the events to come, began on April 5, 1959, when Gill saw a light on the uninhabited Mount Pudi. This light, Gill stated, moved faster than anything he had ever seen.A month or so later, his assistant, Stephen Moi, saw an ""inverted saucer-shaped object"" in the sky above the mission. Gill dismissed these sightings as some sort of electrical or atmospheric phenomena.Little did he know, that these events, whatever they were, had drawn their attention to the sky above them, and soon William Gill would have one of the most celebrated UFO sightings to ever be documented, which was validated by a whole group of additional witnesses.This extraordinary event would take place at 6:45 P.M., June 26, 1959. Father Gill saw what he described as a bright white light to the Northwest. Word of the sight spread quickly, and within a few moments, Gill was joined by no less than thirty-eight additional witnesses, including Steven Moi, Ananias Rarata, and Mrs Nessle Moi.According to sworn statements, these thirty-plus individuals watched a four-legged, disc-shaped object approximately the size of 5 full moons lined up end to end. This unbelievable craft was hovering over the mission!To their utter surprise, they saw four human-like figures that seemed to be performing a kind of task. Now and then one of the figures would disappear, only to reappear in a moment or two.A blue light would shine up from the craft at what seemed to be regular intervals. The witness watched the craft and its activities for a full forty-five minutes, until the shining ship rose into the sky, and disappeared at 7:30 P.M.Glued to the sky, the witnesses would see several smaller objects appear at 8:30, and twenty minutes later, the first craft reappeared. This phenomenal occurrence would last an incredible four hours, until cloud cover obscured the view at 10:50. Father Gill prepared a full written report of this event, and 25 other observers signed the document.Papua, New Guinea Map This first sighting, a once in a lifetime occurrence, would incredibly be followed by another sighting the very next night. At 6:00 P.M., the larger object appeared again, with its occupants. It was shadowed by two of the smaller objects.In William Gill\'s own words: ""On the large one, two of the figures seemed to be doing something near the center of the deck. They were occasionally bending over and raising their arms as though adjusting or ""setting up"" something. One figure seemed to be standing, looking down at us.""(In a moment of anticipation, Gill raised his arms and waved to the figure.)""To our surprise the figure did the same. Ananias waved both arms over his head; then the two outside figures did the same. Ananias and myself began waving our arms, and all four seemed to wave back. There seemed no doubt that our movements were answered... ""Gill and Ananias continued to occasionally wave, and their waves were returned. Another witness, Eric Kodawara, waved a torch, and there were acknowledgments from the craft. Gill went inside to eat, but when he came back, the craft was still there, only farther away (smaller).After a Church service, at 7:45, Gill again came outside to look for the craft, but clouds had appeared, and there was no sight of the object. The very next evening, the shining craft would make one more appearance.Gill counted eight of them at 6:45.At 11:20, Gill heard a loud bang on the roof of the mission. Going outside to see what had happened, he spied four UFOs in a circle around the building. These four craft were extremely high in the sky. The roof was checked for damage the next morning, but none was found.The aftermath of the event would bring unsubstantiated explanations. The noted UFO debunker Dr. Donald H. Menzel offered his explanation thus: He claims that Father Gill, who suffered from myopia (nearsightedness), had ""probably"" not been wearing his corrective lenses, and misidentified the planet Venus, which was prevalent in the evening skies during this period.This was NOT true; Gill WAS wearing his glasses, and in either event, what about the other witnesses to the event.Menzel also asserted that the Papuans were ignorant, native people who worshiped Gill, and believed anything he told them. This was a surefire way to debunk the 30+ witnesses.As to the Venus connection, Gill knew where Venus was during this sighting, and had even pointed it out separately to the unknown craft. Gill would be criticized for ""leaving such an extraordinary sight"" to go eat dinner, but his response is that he did not think of the craft as extraterrestrial at the time.He believed that it was an American or Australian craft, and that if it did land, that ordinary human beings would emerge.Gill was scheduled to return to Australia soon, and it afforded an excellent opportunity to get his documentation of the case to the appropriate authorities.All investigators found Gill to be an intelligent, impressive individual. One of the most respected civilian groups, the Victorian Flying Saucer Research Society stated:""Gill\'s reports constitute the most remarkable testimony of intensive UFO activity ever reported to civilian investigators. They were unique because for the first time, credible witnesses had reported the presence of humanoid beings associated with UFOs.""written by B J BoothContinue with The Papua, New Guinea Sighting,Part 2. Page 2 contains video of Gill\'s testimony.The sighting at Papua brought about an unlikely allegiance among UFO research groups in Australia. The groups distributed copies of Reverend Gill\'s report to all of the members of the House of Representatives of Australia\'s Federal Parliament.An accompanying letter urged the leaders of government to request the Minister for Air to issue an opinion on the subject, not being satisfied with their initial, negative reaction. This letter did exact a reply.On November 24, 1959, E.D. Cash, who was a Liberal member of Parliament, asked the Minister for Air, F.M. Osborne, if they had even investigated the sightings at Papua. Osborne\'s response was that they were still waiting for more evidence before making an ""official"" report. In his own words;""Most sightings of UFOs are explained and only a very small percentage-something like 3 per cent-of reported sightings of flying objects cannot be explained.""The response of the Australian Minister for Air was to be taken lightly, considering the fact that they had not even interviewed Gill, until the Minister of Defense requested an investigation into the matter. The RAAF finally interviewed Gill in December 1959, some six months after the sightings.Gill related that the interview consisted of two officers who talked about stars and planets, and then left. He heard no more from the two. The RAAF finally released an opinion on the case... and a negative one at that. Squadron leader, F.A. Lang stated:Gill Drawing of Sighting ""Although the Reverend Gill could be regarded as a reliable observer, it is felt that the June/July incidents could have been nothing more than natural phenomena coloured by past events and subconscious influences of UFO enthusiasts.During the period of the report the weather was cloudy and unsettled with light thunder storm.Although it is not possible to draw firm conclusions, an analysis of rough bearings and angles above the horizon does suggest that at least some of the lights observed were the planets Jupiter, Saturn and Mars.""Since the unusual events of 1959, there have been many ""explanations"" of the event, all by individuals who had not witnessed the event. Most of these are, as you would expect, panaceas for the general reports of sightings. Among these are hoax, planets, stars, astronomical misidentification, Gill\'s myopia, etc.None of these really address the event as it happened. Dr. J. Allen Hynek investigated the sighting at great length, and gave his usual well thought out conclusions.His ""Center For UFO Studies"" research included well-respected Allen Hendry, who was, at the time, the Center\'s top investigator. Their conclusions were as follows:""Though the smaller UFOs seen by Gill could be attributable to bright stars and planets, the primary object COULD NOT. ""its size and absence of movement over three hours ruled out an astronomical explanation.""The inclusion of the Boianai case in the well-known Australian book of fiction, Randolph Stow\'s 1979, ""Visitants,"" would become a double-edged sword. Although it brought the details of the case to a larger audience, its inclusion in pure fiction lessened the appeal of the events as being REAL.Stow was a cadet patrol-officer in Papua, New Guinea, and an assistant to the Government Anthropologist. His novel begins with this sentence, ""On 26 June 1959, at Boianai in Papua, visitants appeared to the Reverend William Booth Gill, himself a visitant of thirteen years standing, and to thirty-seven witnesses of another colour.""The events of New Papua in 1959, at first glance, seem to be too unbelievable to be true. It is just too good of a sighting, compared to hazy photographs, reports of abductions by unreliable witnesses, and the designation of any undefined light in the sky as a ""flying saucer.""To be respectable, open-minded individuals, we must NOT compare one report to another. Each case must be viewed on its own merits. Many of the so-called explanations are by those who never interviewed Reverend Gill, never visited the site, and never read Gill\'s actual reports, but relied on third party explanations to draw their own conclusions.Dr. Hynek and his staff members actually interviewed Gill, they visited the site, they searched weather reports, and they stood in the same spot that Gill stood. They interviewed other witnesses of the events. They followed up initial inquiries with subsequent visits, and interviews, allowing the passage of time to shed its light on the witnesses, and what they had seen.Fourteen years after the fantastic events at Papua, Dr. Hynek revisited Papua New Guinea, Australia, and re-interviewed six of the initial witnesses.They all supported William Gill\'s initial reports, and still believe what they saw to be a REAL craft of unknown origin. The Papua, New Guinea sighting is one of the best documented cases of an unidentified craft of unknown origin in UFO annals.']"
1977, ,"['Fostoria, Ohio, late October, 1977, Close Encounter with a Train  convey_source = ""English""; convey_user = ""bjbooth"";    by Francis Ridge Twice a day the C&O; railroad sent a trainload of 35 to 40 empty box cars north out of Columbus, Ohio, to pick up processed food at the Fostoria Distribution Company warehouse 3 to 3 1/2 miles north of Fostoria, Ohio. The warehouse is located on the north side of Jones Road,  and east of three main line tracks. U.S. Route 23 is located over 200 yards to the west of and parallel to the tracks. A church sits on the east side of Route 23. In order for the train to move the box car load into the warehouse, the front part of the train must operate from the eastern most main line track. In addition to the engineer in the train cab, a conductor is needed to work along side the cars to uncouple the empties and couple up the full cars for the return trip to Columbus. A breakman works at the end of the train inside the warehouse. All communicate by walkie-talkie type radios.On this night, possibly the 21st of October, the engineer who we shall call Howard J. Albert, was sitting in his locomotive cab on the main line track. It was cold and clear. Several box cars had been cut loose and were parked to the south of the switch track to the warehouse. The engine was coupled up to the rest of the cars which were being moved into position within the warehouse. At about 3:20 AM,  Howard saw what looked to be a shooting star to the west; it curved down out of the northwest. He was sitting in his cab facing southbound. The first box car blocked his view in this direction. The light came down in the field toward Route 23 between him and the church. Slowly, at about the speed of a walking man, it came toward him across the field. It was approximately 16 feet off the ground and stopped on the other side of the tracks between four and five box car lengths away - 180 to 270 feet.Howard picked up his radio and called out to his conductor who was about seven or eight car lengths down the track, ""Donald... come up to the engine."" Donald replied by radio and asked what was happening. Howard answered, ""Hey, we got a g- d— UFO up here."" By this time the UFO had moved to within two car lengths of the track.The object was ""birthday cake"" or disk shaped, about 90 feet in diameter, and 45 feet high. It was brightly lit, with banks of nine vertical ""tubes"" separated by a dark void space that reflected no light. Short horizonal tubes ran over the top and bottom of these voids. The bottom of the disk could be seen; it appeared like ceramic and was ""the color of a common kind of knife sharpening stone... gray with a trace of lavender."" No windows, ladders, antenna, or markings of any sort were observed. There was no sound associated with the disk.The disk was slightly tilted and rotating counter clockwise. Both Howard and Donald used their railroad stop watches twice to time the speed of rotation. The speed was 9 rpm. They could not say what was used as a reference point for the timing, but are sure their estimate was accurate.The object glowed yellow. Electric-like energy arcs ran around the disk in a clockwise direction. They were blue in color. As the arc touched the tubes, the tubes lit up. When the center of the tubes were touched, the ends lit up. When the ends of the tubes were touched by the arcs, the centers lit up At one point the tower operator In Fostoria, hearing radio conversation between the three men, called and asked, ""Hey, Howard, you got a UFO out there?"" Howard replied, ""Yes, Merv, we got a UFO up here. He\'s damn close."" Merv then asked, ""Do you want the cops up there?"" The reply was, ""Nol They can\'t drive up to where we\'re at. And if they do get here, they\'ll probably shoot at It. It isn\'t hurting anybody. We\'re playing games with it.""Howard turned on his train cab headlight for a two count and then turned It off. The object lit up very bright for a similar period of time and then dimmed down. Howard turned his light up twice and then turned it off again. The object reacted in kind and then dimmed down. Testing his engine, a General Motors Model 3900, he increased the output to 1500 amps. The engine worked. The object did not respond. The walkie-talkies worked, as did the base radio on the train.After about 22 minutes,  the object started spinning faster and faster and got as bright as it had earlier when it responded to Howard\'s head light signals. Suddenly, without a sound, it took off up and to the northwest until it looked like a yellow star. That is how they last saw it when they returned to work.When the object was close across the tracks something told them that they should stay on the train and not cross the tracks. They also seemed to know that if they blew the train whistle the object would leave. Howard thought that the object\'s occupants were observing their engine, a relatively uncommon model, and in turn were allowing them to observe their craft. The conductor heard the radio description of the object, but only got up to the engine in time to see it as a yellow star-like object high in the northwest sky.MORA', 'Fostoria, Ohio, late October, 1977, Close Encounter with a Train  convey_source = ""English""; convey_user = ""bjbooth"";    by Francis Ridge Twice a day the C&O; railroad sent a trainload of 35 to 40 empty box cars north out of Columbus, Ohio, to pick up processed food at the Fostoria Distribution Company warehouse 3 to 3 1/2 miles north of Fostoria, Ohio.

Nearly all kinds of UFOs were seen; some big, some small, saucer shaped, cigar shaped, luminous or not. They arrived from the North every day, from the sky and also sometimes from underwater, and it lasted for months.Regularly, some Island inhabitants were targeted by the objects, sending strange rays to them, and many were badly hurt, with two reported dead. The Army intervenes, the press follows. 35 people were hurt by the strange rays, and many fled from the Island.The events mainly concentrated on the city of Colares, about 2,000 inhabitants, on Colares Island, which is in the region of Pará, the delta of the Amazon river on the northeastern coast of Brazil. But the whole region was visited by the same phenomenon. Which has brought many ufologists to visit the city.Beginning in August of 1977, in the island of Colares, a strange phenomenon began to occur, that the Brazilian call Chupa-chupa.Strange luminous objects appeared over the few towns of the region. These objects were often projecting thin rays, seemingly of light, directed at the people. The touched people fainted and woke up with a strange anemia. They stated that they felt as if some of their blood was removed by the strange rays.The fisherman Manoel João de Oliveira Filho, aged 44, married and residing at No. 64 rua Carneiro de Mendonça, was strolling towards the beach early one morning with some companions, to spend a day at sea fishing.Before they had arrived at their boats, they saw - above the Rio Novo beach - an object shaped ""like an umbrella"" stationary at about 4 meters from the ground. From its under-part came a vivid white light.No sound was detectable from it from where they were standing. The object then moved away silently towards Machadinho, turning off the light as it went.A carpenter named João Dias Costa (aged 44) and a fisherman, Joao da Cruz Silva (aged 54), both of Colares town, saw the notorious ""luminous spheres"" so greatly feared on account of their ""low skimming swoops"".Another man from Colares town, Sr. Zacarias dos Santos Barata (74) saw the glowing balls on two nights. The first time, the object came from the direction of the Bay of Marajo, and rapidly vanished towards the interior of Colares Island.On the second night another ball, blue in color, flew over the local football field. ""It lit up all the trees around the field and then vanished towards the town\'s center,” said Sr. Zacarias.Sr. Sebastiao Vernek ""Zizi"" Miranda described his experience as follows:""I was there with my wife, Palmira, in front of the church on the sea-front, when at about 8.00 pm, we saw an intensely vivid ""orangish"" light coming in from the sea towards the town. As it approached, it climbed, and then, moving rapidly, vanished towards the inner part of the Island.""The barber Carlos Cardoso de Paula (aged 49), living at Travessa Deodoro da Fonseca No. 231, had a still closer encounter with the ""lights"", as he himself relates:""Everybody else was asleep. I was just still having my last smoke when suddenly a ball of fire entered our house up near the ridgepole of the gable. It started shooting round and round the room, and then finally came right close to my hammock.""It ran up my right leg as far as the knee (without touching my skin). I watched with much curiosity as it then moved across to the other leg. Then I started to feel feeble and sleepy. My cigarette fell from my hand and I came to and let out a yell. The fireball quickly vanished and everybody woke up.""I think it had been searching for a vein in my body but didn’t manage to do so. As its brightness grew, I felt a sort of heat coming from it.""Worker Raimundo Costa Leite, very well known in the town of Colares for his skill in making and repairing fishing nets, described his own experience:""At about 4.00 in the early morning, I went with my pal “Baixinho” (Orivaldo Malaquias Pinheiro) to fish off the beach at Cajueiro. As I recall it, Baixinho shouted, \'Look! There it is!\' and took to his heels, leaving me alone on the beach.""The craft was of the size and shape of a helicopter, made no noise, and was flying very high.""I could have taken a pot-shot at it if I had had a gun with me. I was terrified when the machine shone a sort of searchlight down on the beach. That light was sweeping the ground, illuminating everything! It was a bluish light (sort of ‘cold light’).""It made it easier for me to see this because the craft had several small reddish lights beneath its front part... The craft seemed to be seeking something on the ground.""I was scared that it would touch me and, despite my poor physical condition, I managed to run quite a distance, and then Baixinho returned and helped me. The object had come from the direction of the sea and it headed off into the inner part of the Island.""Actually, so many more people reported being attacked by beams of light from small UFOs in this area that only few of them are mentioned here.On October 20, three women were hit in the breast by the beams of light: ""All three were overcome by tremendous nervous tension and an unknown sort of lassitude as though they were receiving constant electric shocks,"" wrote a newspaper.On the evening of October 29, Benedito Campos and his seventeen-year-old wife Silvia Mara were at home when ""they spotted an oval, silvery object emitting a greenish beam like a searchlight towards the room where they were lying.""Filled with curiosity, they approached a small window and, as they did so, the beam shot in through it, and made straight for Silvia, throwing her into a sort of benumbed trance-like state.""Silvia, who was pregnant at the time, then fainted, whereupon two entities apparently entered the house carrying something resembling a golden torch and ""once again the beam struck Silvia, this time hitting her in the left arm at the level of the wrist.""Her veins seemed to \'rise up out of the body\' so swollen were they by the beam striking them.""Later, while at a neighbour\'s house, Benedito was also briefly paralyzed by a light beam. Fearing a miscarriage, husband and wife were taken at night by boat to the Mosqueiro Medical Clinic, followed all the way by the UFO, which made no further attempt to harm them.They remained there for three days while the wife recovered, but Benedito ""was in a state of severe depression for some days, his motor functions disturbed and, as his mother reports, weeping frequently.""The UFO activity over Colares Island was so intense that the people began to think the ""Chupa-chupas"" were trying to make some sort of contact with them. Such was the view expressed by Sr. Raimundo Ferreira ""Mimi"" Monteiro. He still believes the craft were coming up out of the sea or out of some underwater base located in the Bay of Marajó, possibly in the region of the Caldeirão.Alfredo Bastos Filho, a former town mayor, confirmed this and said: ""Yes, indeed I can tell you, there wasn’t a moment of peace. The populace were terrified by that ""Chupa-chupa"" affair. I even managed to see one of the injured victims myself - Dona Mirota, a lady who was receiving medical treatment at the Health Clinic.""The locals became so frightened that many of the women and children left town. The men that remained lit bonfires to mount guard at night, letting off fireworks and banging tins whenever they saw the Chupa-chupas approaching.Others locked themselves in their homes for fear of the phenomenon. It was mentioned later that the more din people made and the more bonfires and fireworks, the closer the craft came.Colares 1\tColares image 2By November 1977 doctor Wellaide Cecim Carvalho, the physician in charge of the health unit on Colares Island, took care of to some 35 people claiming to have been touched by the strange light.She took blood samples, and concluded that the victims suffered from generalized hypertermia, superficial chronic headache, burnings, intense heat, nauseas, tremors in the body, giddiness, asthenia and presented very small orifices in the skin where they were hit by the rays.She wrote: ""All of them had suffered lesions to the face or the thoracic area."" The lesions, looking like radiation injuries, ""began with intense reddening of the skin in the affected area. Later the hair would fall out and the skin would turn black. There was no pain, only a slight warmth. One also noticed small puncture marks in the skin. The victims were men and women of varying ages, without any pattern.""In describing their experiences with these light beams, most victims claimed that ""They were immediately immobilized, as if a heavy weight pushed against their chest. The beam was about [seven or eight centimetres] in diameter and white in color. It never hunted for them but hit them suddenly.""When they tried to scream, no sound would come out, but their eyes remained open. The beam felt hot, \'almost as hot as a cigarette burn,\' barely tolerable. ""After a few minutes the column of light would slowly retract and disappear."" Most symptoms usually disappeared after seven days. ""At Agulhas Fincadas, Mrs. Maria Lopes, inhabitant of Vila Gorete, to the margins of Rio Tapajós, in the neighborhoods of Santarém (Pará), tells her case involving ""strange devices"" that absorb energy from human beings, known as Chupa-Chupa.""I saw an object to settle quiet in the bushes here close... It had left two men and a woman, who had started to move with two fishing,"" counts Maria.Other people in the place had been paralyzed when observing the scene.Many had hurt themselves when trying to escape one of the strange objects. In many cases, the marks left by the rays on the victims skin were marks that could have up to eight small holes. In these occurrences, the Chupa-Chupa term was proven right as many of them had lost up to approximately 300 ml of blood, from these wounds.This was the case of Claudomira, resident in the Island of Colares. She claims that her family already did not sleep right with fear of the devices.""In one of these days, after midnight, I woke up because of a strong flash, a sort of focussed bright green light ray that came down from the top roof to my left chest. I tried to shout, but my voice did not function. I felt an esquisite heat... Later, that beam of light diminished and I saw that I was burnt.""Claudomira told that she sighted a strange object, much similar to an umbrella, from which a being of clear skin, oriental eyes, and great ears.According to her, the creature was dressed in tight green clothes and had a sort of pistol in the hand, which emitted the luminous beam. At this moment, Claudomira felt perforated as by needles on her breast.""After this, I felt a migraine headache and a great weakness, that left me collapsed for several days.""The next day, she had been directed to the Sanitary Unit of the town, where she was taken care of by Doctor Wellaide Cecim Carvalho, who sent her to the Medical Institute Renato Chaves, in Belém, for backup examinations.Her ill-being and the constant migraines lasted many days, followed by fatigue and weakness. Years later, Claudomira still did not feel cured.""My health never came back to be the same since that night.""She is not the only one to have passed for such situation. Some estimate that thousands of people, also men, had suffered the attacks of the Chupa-Chupa in the years between 1970 and 1980, and they still occur today, though less frequently.""Emotional and physical sequels are very common in these cases,"" affirmed Dr. Wellaide Cecim Carvalho, who took care of Claudomira.Although she was skeptical and she believed that the occurrences of Chupa-Chupa were popular belief or some witchcraft, Dr. Wellaide ended up convinced of the veracity of the cases when she was confronted with their increasing frequency.""With the increase of hurt people, I started to give more attention each time in the existing injuries. I saw things that do not exist in my medical books,"" she said.According to her, the victims of Chupa-Chupa presented strangest burnings, not as those provoked by fire or hot water, as she thought herself, but very similar to ones produced by cobalt irradiation.""The injuries varied in intensity. First it started with an intense reddishness in the hit area, known as hiperemia. Later, the skin of the affected region started to fall (alopecia) and days later the skin peeled off.In this period of development, said Wellaide, it was possible to note holes, similar to perforations by needles.One of the most interesting cases she took care of happened with a lady who had cardiac problems. She arrived at the doctor\'s office very nervous and immediately she showed her left breast, in which were two strange holes.She complained of giddiness, shortness of breath, and weakness - characteristic symptoms already known by people hit by the phenomenon. The doctor tried to calm her and she returned to her home.But at about 03:00 pm, however, Dr. Wellaide was called to the residence of the woman, who had become very sick. Her whole body was still, and she gasped for air, but she did not have fever and did not vomit.Seeing the seriousness of the situation, the doctor took her to a hospital in Belém.Hours later, she received the medical papers and the certificate of death forwarded by the Medical Institute Legal Renato Chaves, which stated a heart stroke as cause of the death.The intriguing fact is that at no time, doctors in Belém had mentioned something about the injuries on her body and did not even say if they had effected backing examinations.Regarding the possible effects of the UFOs on the supply of electricity, Sr. Geraldo Aranha de Oliveira (aged 37) of the C.E.I.P.A. (Pará Electricity Plant) explained:""In 1977 the C.E.I.P.A. sub-station consisted of three Scania 125 kw engines supplying light to the city from 6 pm till midnight. I don’t recall having ever seeing a UFO over the plant. I merely remember that, at that period, lots of lightning conductor rods were burnt out and, at times, some fuses too.""COMAR (Comando Aéreo Regional, the Regional Air Command of the Brazilian Air Forces), arrived in Belém, and made a series of researches in the region, under the project name ""Operation Plate."" (Operation Saucer)Captain Uyrangê Bolivar Soares Nogueira de Hollanda Lima, head of information office, directed all the operations in the region. During the investigations, the Air Force obtained four films and hundreds of photographs of flying disks in the basin of Marajó.They also were a great help to the population, providing psychologists assistance, to eliminate the panic that sized the entire region.The beams of light from the craft were described as being so bright that they resembled those used to illuminate night sporting events. They were ""always sharply defined, directed with perfect precision towards any target – houses, people, boats, trees, even the Brazilian Air Force\'s helicopters deployed over the island during the investigations.""On one occasion, one of these powerful beams is reported to have forced one of the helicopters to land, although the exact technical reason is not given. (Giese, 1996)According to a statement by Sr. Sebastião V. Miranda, former resident of Colares, ""the Brazilian Air Force spent more than 35 days in the town, and installed various devices near the Bacurí beach.""Sra. Alba Câmara Vilhena, a married lady living at 683 rua 15 de Novembro, added: ""At the time of the ""Chupa-chupa"" everybody was scared to sleep at night, and so almost every night we went away to be with relatives. On one occasion some people saw one of the craft. It was round, and all luminous.""Just at that moment, a helicopter of the F.A.B. (Brazilian Air Force) was flying quite near to our house. Then we saw the UFO direct a very powerful beam on to the helicopter, obliging it to land on the São Pedro Airfield. That happened at about 8.00 pm one evening.""Professor Raimundo Sebastião Aranha said: ""At that period I was closely connected with some of the Air Force\'s enquiries. They were seeking more information about the ""Chupa-chupa.""He said the Air Force had with them masses of equipment: cars, helicopters, radio transmitters, cameras, powerful glasses, etc. He recalls that, in addition to the rank and file Air Force recruits, there was a whole group of officers, and he had the impression that there was a foreigner among them.""The helicopters that appeared from time to time, bringing materials and personnel, attempted to chase the UFOs but without much success. Indeed, on the contrary, it was the UFOs that chased them!""One night several months later, on May 24 1978, a journalist and photographer, who had been sent to cover the local UFO encounters, were in their car when despite the heavy rain they were woken up ""by a powerful beam of light which – however unbelievable, it may seem – passed through the metallic structure of the roof of the vehicle.""Not surprisingly they leapt out of the car to see that ""a tube-shaped light beam, about [twenty-five centimetres] in diameter, was coming down from above onto the roof of the car and passing through the metal panelling.""On this and other occasions, they managed to take numerous photographs which they claim that their newspaper later sold to ""a North-American group.""On another night while trying to use flash equipment to photograph one of these craft ""the UFO emitted such a vivid beam of light that it smashed the windscreen"" of their car. (Giese, 1996)Several newspapers started to write that the alleged UFOs were weather balloons, or secrets satellites, although there was no possible reason to think that. Local authorities were of course extremely angry because of such articles. Elói Santos, councilman of the old Enclosure for bullfighting stated:""It is not possible to deny that Belém is, today, a frightened city. We are not technicians, and we do not argue with the conclusion of the authorities. But we did surprise them with declarations of the witnesses who saw light crossing their roofs to penetrate in their skin, removing a little of blood and leaving visible marks of needles and burnings on their epidermis.""Mosquiero 1\tMosquiero image 2During the ""Chupa-chupa"" wave, many new ""sighting zones"" emerged, such as Pinheiro and São Bento in the State of Maranhão, and Viseu and Bragança in the State of Pará. Some areas indeed reached such a \'level of saturation\' that rarely a single night passed without UFO sightings.One of these ""ufological epicentres"" was over the bay called the Baía do Sol (Bay of the Sun) and had a direct effect upon the Island of Mosqueiro. Mosqueiro is one of the most important of the islands, and it is the biggest, belonging to the municipality of Belém.Public concern was immense, all the men banding together at night to organize watches, with bonfires and fireworks, thinking these would deter the craft. But nothing seemed to stop the UFOs, not even the Air Force’s film men and their cameras - and even less the journalists from the Estado do Pará!There were frequent and regular sightings of mother-ships, probes, and flying saucers, all performing incredible manoeuvers over the Bay.A 61-year-old widow, Elisa da Silva, residing on rua do Bacari, was one of the witnesses in that year (1977). One night, from her house, she saw a flying saucer appear. Vivid white light came from small windows or apertures on it. Seen from below, she said, it seemed quite dark and quite flat. It vanished towards the South, in total silence.In the opinion of some of the members of the GUA (Amazonian Ufological Group) based in Belém, there exists, or there did exist for a considerable time, at some point beneath the Baía do Sol (""Bay of the Sun"") a concealed base for extraterrestrial probe craft. Such an idea would account for the constant appearances, in recent years, of unidentified flying objects over the region.In 1981, one woman who had been exposed to the UFO beams in Colares died, although it is not clear that her death was clearly related to the attack.In 1986, not far from Colares, two persons on Crab Island were discovered ""badly decomposed by heat"" amid numerous sightings of balls of fire in the sky; cause of death ""not known"" in either case.Same area, different time: a ""ball of fire"" seriously burned three men out cutting wood on Crab Island; one of the woodchoppers died.One of the two survivors, Edmundo, had a gaping electrical-type burn injury on the side of his chest, an almost perfect replica of the chest burn suffered by Jack Angel in Georgia in 1974.In 1993, again in Colares, a 32-year-old missionary and a 40-year-old domestic worker died, a month apart, as a result of close encounters with UFO; according to Ufologist Bob Pratt, these women were ""both burned on the throat and the chest, as were most of the other people the doctor treated.""Said Pratt: ""I know of about ten deaths that have some connection with UFO close encounters.""According to the USAF, there is not one proof of the reality of UFOs, and there is no evidence that they can be a danger. According to the skeptics... According to the skeptics? To tell the truth, skeptics never express anything in such cases.

He and his partner, Patrolman Jerry Jeter, were definitely impressed.  ""It was three hundred to five hundred meters above us and we could see the whole belly of the craft,"" Jeter said.   The two were members of the police department’s Tactical Squad, men who are specially chosen for their coolness, intelligence and special skills with weapons. Three other members of the squad saw a similar object earlier in the evening but at a greater distance.  “I believe what I saw was an unidentified flying object and I believe it was some aircraft not of this earth,” said Todd, then twenty-nine.   The two men reported seeing the object hovering over a municipal golf course in the southern part of Memphis about three thirty in the morning of May 17, 1977. They got out of their unmarked police van and watched the object for two or three minutes.  As members of the Tactical Squad, they carried special weapons with them. Jeter took a rifle with a telescopic sight out of its case to get a better look at the craft. He said that as soon as he shouldered the rifle and pointed it at the object to look at it through the scope, the object shot off across the horizon in an instant.  It was an awesome sight and marked the end of a strange night for Todd, Jeter and three other officers.  Four and a half hours earlier, three other members of the Tactical Squad – Patrolmen John Birdsong, Michael Davidson and Forrest Bartlett – saw a triangular-shaped object lit up like ""a Christmas tree” as it flew over a police substation in the northern part of the city.TRIANGULAR OBJECT SPOTTED  Birdsong was going off duty at the time and the other two were just going on duty. The three said nothing to anybody at the time about their sighting.  However, later in the night when Jeter radioed the central dis\xadpatcher and said he and Todd had sighted a UFO, Davidson asked them by radio if it was triangular in shape and had multicolored lights.  Jeter replied yes. Until then, neither he nor Todd had said anything on the radio about the object\'s shape or lights and had given no other details. All five officers believe they saw the same object.  Of the two sightings, the one by Jeter and Todd was more spectacular. They had been driving an unmarked police van south on Interstate 240 in the city when Todd spotted something in the sky.  ""I was driving and as we approached the Norris Road exit I observed to my left, which would have been to the east, a triangular-shaped series of lights over some high tension towers,"" said Todd.  ""I really didn\'t know what I had seen. It was a long, triangular-shaped series of lights approximately thirty five to fifty feet above those towers and it tapered down to a narrow point.""  He asked Jeter it he had seen it but Jeter said no.  ""I couldn’t figure out exactly what it was so we went underneath Alcy Road and turned around on the median and went back up to the same location,"" said Todd, then an eight-year veteran.  ""Both Jeter and I looked over those high-tension wires and we couldn\'t see anything at all. So we proceeded northbound on the expressway to South Parkway, turned around and came south and this time we both observed it approximately five hundred feet above the Pine Hill Golf Course, which would have been to the west off the expressway.  ""This was approximately in the same line where I had a seen it before but it was at a greater height and it was on the other side of the expressway. So I drove the van up onto the Norris Road exit, we stopped and got out and watched it for two or three minutes.  ""It was a triangular-shaped object with white, red and green lights on it with a white glow about the silhouette itself.""DEFINITELY NOT A HELICOPTER  Jeter, a police officer for nine years, said that at first Todd thought he’d spotted a helicopter hovering over the power towers.  ""When we both saw it he said, \'There it is again!\' and I said, \'Well, it\'s not a helicopter.’ It was elongated and looked like a triangular type shape. This object made its way over to the golf course and turned and was just hovering or standing still over the golf course.  ""We pulled up this incline and got out and were looking at this object. In my estimation it was three hundred to five hundred meters high and we were at a slight angle from it, not directly under it but a real slight angle and we could see the whole belly of the craft.          ""It had red and green lights flashing alternately on it and it looked like what were either portholes or real dim lights along the side of the craft. I really couldn\'t tell because they were so dim but it lit up the craft so you could see it, and to me it looked like a metallic craft.  ""We had a telescopic rifle sight in the van and I was going to get it out and look at it. By the time I got it out of the case and everything and got it up to my shoulder, this craft turned slightly, two red lights came on on the rear and it just shot out over the horizon.  ""This thing moved at such a speed it was unbelievable. It shot out of sight.""  Todd said that when Jeter shouldered the rifle, the object ""began to move off in a northerly direction at a reasonably slow speed. There was no sound made from the object. The white and green lights went off. They were no longer visible to us but the glow was still visible around the silhouette.  ""Then two red lights came on on the rear of it. Whether they were lights or not I\'m not sure but when those two red lights came on it sped out at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared over the horizon in just a second to a second and a half. We were barely able to keep it in our eyesight.  ""That night the weather conditions were extremely clear. Visibility was fifteen to twenty miles, I would say, because we were at the top of the expressway looking north.""NOTHING ON RADAR  Jeter got on the radio to the central dispatcher. ""Todd didn\'t want to call. He said they\'ll think we\'re crazy. I said, what the hell, let\'s calI. I don\'t give a damn. So I called the dispatcher and said how about checking with the air control tower (at Memphis International Airport) and see if they have any craft in this area.  ""He (the traffic controller) checked and said no, they didn\'t show anything on radar. He said, \'Why?\' and I said, \'Well, we saw what we figured to be a UFO\' and everybody started coming on the air,"" Jeter said, laughing.  ""And the catcalls started,” added Todd.  Jeter said the dispatcher told him to switch to Channel Six so Patrolmen Davidson and Bartlett could talk to them.  \'We didn\'t say what shape it was or anything,” Jeter said, “and they came on and said was this object triangular or pyramidal in shape and we said yes it was. They said they were standing out on the parking lot at the substation and it came streaking over at twenty three hundred hours.”  Both Todd and Jeter said the craft made no noise as it hovered above the golf course nor when it moved off.  ""It was huge,"" said Jeter. \'I would say a hundred meters in length. Tremendous. We went back and looked at those towers after it was over and those towers are seventy-five meters apart. This thing was overlapping them.” Todd described his initial sighting and said, \'It was sitting with the nose off one side of one tower and the tail off the side of the other.  ""My first sighting of it was a side view. It was more of a delta-wing shape. It had a flat bottom with a taper from the top of a flat back which I would say was thirty five to fifty feet high and it tapered down to a small point.  ""When we observed it the second time, when we both observed it, we were looking at it from the bottom and it was triangular shaped. It was a silvery, gunmetal color.""KIND OF BAMBOOZLED  When asked what he thought when he saw the object, Todd replied: ""We were kind of bamboozled but in my opinion it was definitely a flying aircraft from someplace. It was something I had never seen before and it was of tremendous size.  ""Something of that size that could hover the way it was would have to make some type of noise. I don\'t know if the United States has an aircraft that can hover without making noise but I don\'t believe so.  ""When I made the initial sighting it was more of confusion and wonder at what I had actually seen. And then on my second sighting and seeing it cross the horizon like it did, I knew what it was.  “In my opinion I believe what I saw was an unidentified flying object and I believe it was some aircraft not of this earth.""  All five men worked out of the North Precinct on Old Allen Road about fifteen miles northeast of the golf course. It was in the substation\'s parking lot where Patrolmen Birdsong, Davidson and Bartlett spotted the object earlier in the night.  ""We were sitting in the parking lot on the west side of the substation talking,"" said Birdsong. He and Davidson were facing north and Bartlett, sitting on the trunk of a car, was facing them.  ""I looked up and saw an object going overhead and told Davidson, ‘Look, there goes a flying saucer,’” said Birdsong. “I didn\'t know what it was and Davidson looked up and we tried to get Bartlett to look around. He thought we were just kidding.  ""He wouldn\'t look at first and finally he turned around and looked and said, \'It looks like a flying Christmas tree.\' It was shaped like a triangle and it had lights all around it and underneath it. It was traveling at a pretty good speed.""  Bartlett said that when he did look around he saw “a triangular-shaped object just going by. The point of it was to the front and there were multicolored lights. They were a soft yellow to a bright orange with some greenish tint.  HIGH-FLYING OBJECT  “We Just laughed and wondered what it was. Nobody had any real comment or anything because we heard no sound or anything.”  Some time later Birdsong and Davidson heard Jeter and Todd say on the radio that they’d seen a UFO. “We got them to switch to Channel six so we could talk to them and Davidson asked them if it was a triangular-shaped object and had multicolored lights, and they said. ‘Check.\' So then we knew right off it was the same object we had seen earlier.”  The object made no noise, Davidson said. ""It was pretty high up. The lights were more or less like a Christmas tree. It had lights around it and in the center also, different colors. Green, white and yellow were the ones I remember distinctly. They were separate, individual lights. They didn’t blend into each other.  ""We just shrugged it off. We thought it was something from the naval air station.""  A spokesman at the Millington Naval Air Station, located eight miles north of the police substation, said no craft similar to the one the men described was based there. He said the radar at the station is shut down at eleven o\'clock each night and would not have picked up anything at the time the officers spotted the UFO.  Memphis Police Capt. Paul J. Acerra, who was the duty officer the night Jeter and Todd reported spotting the UFO, said: ""These officers are all mature men with good judgment. To get into the Tactical unit you have to be above average. All of them are responsible citizens. They would not make up anything like this. None of them.""  Ed Becton, a supervisor in the Federal Aviation Authority air traffic control tower at the Memphis International Airport, said: ""The next day we had calls from maybe fifty different reporters, radios and TV stations about this. We checked with all the air traffic controllers on duty at the time and they had nothing on radar in the area of the golf course and they saw nothing visually.""', 'RAF Boulmer Reports of UFO Sightings were Hushed Up, July 1977Published: last update - 27 January 2005 12:00 PM Boulmer reports of UFO sightings were hushed up, July, 1977. THE X-Files came to RAF Boulmer as strange flying objects were spotted hovering over the North Sea by a fighter pilot at the base.In a case that would intrigue TV’s Mulder and Scully, bright objects were spotted by RAF staff in 1977. They changed shape as they watched. So sensitive was the sighting that all records of it were hidden from public gaze and have only just been released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOI). It was stored in the Ministry of Defence’s “possible extra-terrestrial contact” department, known only by the code name SF4. It is one of many sightings listed by the Government where credible witnesses, such as military staff, policemen, and airline pilots, have reported UFOs. The drama started in July 1977, when Flight Lieutenant AM Wood reported seeing the objects, saying the nearest was luminous, round, and four to five times the size of a Whirlwind helicopter. The two possible UFOs were seen hovering at a height of around 5,000 feet, and were three miles out to sea. His report is backed by those of Corporal Torrington and Sergeant Graham, who say the objects parted, with one going west and changing shape as it went. The objects, with one then looking disc-shaped, were watched by the three men for one hour and 40 minutes. A radar station at the base also picked up the objects in the same position before they vanished.Checks were made to RAF West Drayton to see if it had spotted them. Flt Lt Wood is described as “reliable and sober” in the report, which adds that radar staff at RAF Staxton Wold also picked up the strange objects. The RAF Boulmer report was deemed so sensitive that instead of being released to the public 25 years later as normal, a further three-year ban was imposed. It is only because of the FOI Act, which came into force on January 1, that the case was reviewed and the details declassified.Other released reports show that fighters were scrambled in July 1976 when a British Airways pilot reported strange, white, cigar-shaped objects over Portugal. Nearer to home, Chief Supt Hobson, of Manchester Police, watched a bright light for two minutes and followed it along the A62 on July 3, 1976. The reports will add to UFO hunters’ belief that governments have deliberately stayed silent on possible visits by space craft over the years.source:http://www.northumberlandtoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=1117&ArticleID;=930633']"
9500, ,"['Canada Releases UFO X-Files to the World by Michael Salla, Ph.D., Honolulu Exopolitics ExaminerThe Canadian Government has authorized open public access to thousands of federal government documents concerning UFOs. A total of 9500 digitized documents spanning the years 1947 to the early 1980s have been made available through the  Library and Archives Canada website. Titled “Canada\'s UFOs: The Search for the Unknown” the files include correspondence, reports, memos and procedures, some of which specifically deal with UFOs. The files come from Canada’s National Defense Department, the Department of Transport, the National Research Council, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.Canada’s release of its UFO X-Files follows closely upon the release at the end of January of Denmark\'s UFO files. Britain continues to release thousands of UFO files through a program of gradual releases it began in May 2007 through its national archives with the most recent being on October 2008. The French Space Agency had earlier announced on March 22, 2007, that it was making public its secret UFO files through a government website.The important difference between the released Canadian UFO files with other country releases is the inclusion of departmental analyses rather than simply reports of UFO sightings. According to Victor Viggiani from Exopolitics Toronto , who has been monitoring the Canadian Government UFO website since its inception, “The Canadian files do not simply list UFO sightings; they describe actions, meetings and inter-departmental memoranda generated by Canadian officials that attempt to make sense of the considerable onslaught of UFO sightings as well as referencing American problems with keeping abreast of UFO sightings.”For example, a September 1967 memo titled ""Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) - Investigations"", was released which stated:A number of investigations of the reports suggest the possibility of UFOs exhibiting some unique scientific information or advanced technology which could possibly contribute to scientific or technical research.Another memo details a UFO sighting at Shag Harbor witnessed by member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and six civilian witnesses on the night of October 4, 1967. The memo describes how “[w]itnesses reported seeing an object 60 feet in length moving in an easterly direction before it descended rapidly into the water, making a bright splash on impact.” The report continued: “A single white light appeared on the surface of the water for a short period of time. The RCMP, with help from local fishermen and their boats, endeavoured to reach the object before it sank completely.”Undoubtedly the most significant documents are those associated with a 1950-1952 classified investigation and analysis of UFOs by a Department of Transportation team led by Wilbert Smith, a senior radio engineer. In his Project Magnet Report, Smith commented extensively on the flight performance of UFOs that were far in advance to anything known at the time:… it is difficult to reconcile this performance with the capabilities of our technology, and unless the technology of some terrestrial nation is much more advanced than is generally known, we are forced to the conclusion that the vehicles are probably extra-terrestrial, in spite of our prejudices to the contrary.""While not all of the information made available through the Canadian archives is completely new to UFO researchers, it does provide a comprehensive online archive for the public and media to scrutinize the Canadian Government UFO X-Files. Canada first began to release UFO files through its archive in October 2007, and these have quickly increased to its present level of 9500 files. Canada therefore joins a select group of countries that have so far publicly released UFO files. As President Obama heads to Canada on February 19, he could take time from his busy schedule to ask Prime Minister Steven Harper for tips on how the U.S. might release to the public its own classified UFO X-Files.']"
1975, ,"['The Official Explanation Northern U.S., October - November, 1975. Over a period of about three weeks in October and November of 1975, several Strategic Air Command (SAC) bases in the northern tier states were placed on a high priority (Security Option 3) alert because of repeated intrusions of unidentified aircraft flying at low altitude over atomic weapons storage areas.The Commander-in-Chief of North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) sent a four-part message to NORAD units on November 11, 1975 summarizing the events. See excerpts follow: ""Since 28 Oct 75 numerous reports of suspicious objects have been received at the NORAD CU; reliable military personnel at Loring AFB, Maine, Wurtsmith AFB, Michigan, Malmstrom AFB, Mt, Minot AFB, ND, and Canadian Forces Station, Falconbridge, Ontario, Canada have visually sighted suspicious objects.""On October 27-28, 1975, Staff Sgt. Danny K. Lewis, 42nd Security Police Squadron, while on duty at the munitions storage area of Loring AFB, Maine, at 7:45 p.m. saw an apparent aircraft at low altitude along the northern perimeter of the base. Other witnesses were Sgt. Clifton W. Blakeslee and Staff Sgt. William J. Long. The craft had a red light and a pulsating white light. A teletype message to the National Military Command Center in Washington, D.C., said: ""The A/C [aircraft] definitely penetrated the LAFB [Loring Air Force Base] northern perimeter and on one occasion was within 300 yards of the munitions storage area perimeter."" Staff Sgt. James P. Sampley, 2192nd Communications Squadron, was on duty in the control tower when he picked up the craft on radar nearing the base. He tried to make radio contact to warn the presumed aircraft that it was entering a restricted area. The craft began to circle in the vicinity of the nuclear weapons storage area at about 150 feet altitude. When it penetrated the nuclear weapons storage area at an estimated 300 feet altitude, Lewis reported it to the command post. The Commander of the 42nd Bomb Wing, Col. Richard E. Chapman, arrived at the weapons storage area shortly before 8:00 a.m. and security police units were ordered into the area. Security vehicles with flashing lights converged on the scene. Col. Chapman implemented a Security Option 3 alert. At 8:45 p.m. Sgt. Grover K. Eggleston was on duty in the control tower when a call came from the command post requesting a radar track on the mysterious craft. For 40 minutes he observed the object on radar circling around, then it abruptly vanished from the screen as if it had either landed or dropped below the minimum level of radar coverage. Witnesses observed the craft flying away toward New Brunswick. Radar tracked it again as it receded from the base until contact was lost in the vicinity of Grand Falls, 12 miles from Loring AFB. Priority messages on the incident were sent to the National Military Command Center in Washington, D.C., the Air Force Chief of Staff, SAC headquarters, and other major commands. Loring remained on a high state of alert into the following morning. Efforts to identify the ""aircraft"" through the Maine State Police, local police departments, and the Federal Aviation Administration office in Houlton, Maine, were not successful. The next night at 7:45 p.m. a similar craft with body lights again approached the base, tracked on radar, and maneuvered around in the vicinity for more than 30 minutes. Its speed and motions were similar to those of a helicopter. The craft would appear and disappear from view. Its lights went off and the craft reappeared over the weapons storage area at 150 feet (45 meters). At about this time Sgt. Steven Eichner, a B-52 crew chief, Sgt. R. Jones, and other crew members spotted an unidentified red and orange object over the flight line. It looked like a ""stretched out football"" (cigar-shaped) and was hovering in mid-air. As the B-52 crew watched, the lights on the object went out and it disappeared, but soon reappeared over the north end of the runway, moving in a jerky, erratic fashion. When it stopped and hovered, Eichner and the others jumped into a truck and drove toward the object. As they turned onto the road that led to the weapons storage area, they encountered the object about 300 feet ahead hovering about five feet off the ground. Its length appeared to be equivalent to about four car lengths. Sgt. Eichner said that it was like looking at a desert scene. ""You see waves of heat rising off the desert floor. This is what I saw. There were these waves in front of the object and all the colors were blending together. The object was solid and we could not hear any noise coming from it."" The object again was tracked on radar as it departed towards New Brunswick. And once again priority messages about the intrusion were sent to higher commands. No explanation was ever found. On October 30, 1975, at Wurtsmith AFB, Michigan, about 10:10 p.m., base personnel saw the running lights of a low-flying craft thought to be a helicopter, except that it hovered and moved up and down erratically near the base perimeter. One white light was pointed downward and two red lights were visible near the trailing edge. Airman Michael J. Myers, an air policeman on duty near the main gate, saw several unidentified lights near the western edge of the base. The object turned north and appeared to lose altitude. Between 10:15 and 10:25 p.m., base security police at the back gate of Wurtsmith reported to the command post that an unidentified ""helicopter"" with no lights had come over the back gate and hovered at low altitude over the weapons storage area. Radar was also tracking low-flying objects intruding into the base, and an incoming KC-135 confirmed seeing two unidentified craft that sped away each time they attempted to close in for identification. A teletype message November 2nd from Loring Air Force Base, Maine, Office of Special Investigations (OSI) detachment to the National Military Command Center and OSI headquarters in Washington, D.C., reported another ""unidentified helicopter sighted at low level over Loring AFB"" over the past two nights (October 31-November 1). It also referred to the intruder as an ""unknown entity."" Capt. Richard R. Fuhs, Operations Officer, 42nd Security Police Squadron (SPS), "" ...advised that there had been three verified sightings of an unidentified A/C [aircraft] flying at low level over and in the vicinity of LAFB [Loring Air Force Base]"" during this period. The initial sighting was made by Staff Sgt. Michael D. Scott, 42nd SPS, on duty at 11:14 p.m. Tech. Sgt. David E. Mott, Flight Chief, 42nd SPS, spotted the object from a position near the East Gate just past midnight, flying from east to west. At Malmstrom AFB, Montana, November 7, 1975, electronic sensors at the Minuteman missile sites triggered an alarm indicating a breach of the K-7 site security at about 3:00 p.m. A Sabotage Alert Team headed toward the site, and from a distance of about a mile saw a glowing orange object over the area. As they came closer they could see that it was an enormous disc, the size of a football field, whose light was illuminating the missile site. They reported this to the launch control facility, and were ordered to proceed into the site. But they refused to do so because they were fearful of the consequences. The object then began to rise and was picked up on NORAD radar at about 1,000 feet. Two F-106 interceptors were scrambled from Great Falls and sped toward the area, but the object continued to rise and disappeared off the radar screen at about 200,000 feet. As noted in the NORAD Commander-in-Chief\'s report cited above, the pilots were unable to obtain a visual sighting. Later investigation established that computer codes in the missile warhead had been altered. Several other UFO sightings at the missile sites later that evening and next day were documented in military records. During the same time period as the SAC base intrusions, civilians, police officers, military officers, and NORAD radar saw and tracked UFOs that alternately hovered and darted around at high speed at Falconbridge Air Force Station, a radar site near North Bay, Ontario, Canada. The sightings occurred between 3:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. local time, November 11, 1975. NORAD regional director logs obtained by Larry Fawcett and Barry Greenwood gave some indication of the events, with times expressed in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) or ""Zebra"" (Z) time. 1205 GMT. ""Unusual sighting report"" made. 1840 GMT. Jet interceptors were scrambled, airborne at 1750Z ""due to unusual object sighting ...UFO report from Falconbridge."" At 0202Z on November 15, 1975, ""Report sent to NCOC Surveillance, referred to Assistant Command Director Space Defense Center, and intelligence. These 3 individuals considered the report a UFO report and not an unknown track report."" A detailed NORAD report on the incidents and a subsequent press release based on it both have been made public. Raymond E. Fowler quotes the NORAD report: ""Falconbridge reported [at 4:05 a.m.] search and height finder paints [radar targets] on an object 25 to 30 nautical miles south of the site ranging in altitude from 26,000 feet to 72,000 feet [appearing visually as like a bright star]. With binoculars, the object appeared as a 100-ft. diameter sphere and appeared to have craters [sic] around the outside... To date, efforts by Air Guard helicopters, SAC helicopters and NORAD F-106s have failed to provide positive identification."" On November 13, NORAD issued a press release in Sudbury, Ontario, containing essentially the same information. The press release added that, ""Two F-106 aircraft of the U.S. Air Force Air National Guard\'s 171st Fighter Interceptor Squadron at Selfridge ANGB [Air National Guard Base], Michigan, were scrambled; but the pilots reported no contact with the object."" Seven Ontario police officers were among the witnesses to the UFOs that were also tracked on NORAD radar alternately hovering and darting around at high speed. Capt. Gordon Hilchie, director of public affairs for the 22nd NORAD Region Control Center at North Bay, Ontario, acknowledged: ""Yes, we saw this so-called UFO at the same time people outside were seeing it too."" Lt. Col. Brian Wooding, Control Center Director, said: ""We get quite a few UFO reports, but to my knowledge this is about the only one we\'ve actually seen on radar, and the only time we\'ve gone to the point of scrambling interceptors. The jets were scrambled because the indications were there was something very evident to a large number of people, and because we did manage to get some sort of radar sighting."" Del Kindschi, spokesman for NORAD headquarters in Colorado Springs, said the UFO was tracked on radar intermittently for six hours, first spotted 25-30 miles south of the radar site. The object zoomed from 26,000 feet to 45,000 feet, "" ... stopped a while, and then moved up very quickly to 72,000 feet."" The first visual sightings were at 3:00 a.m. from Sudbury, Ontario, as brilliant lights that hovered low in the sky, then suddenly shot straight up at tremendous speed. Addendum: On September 27, 2014, the UFO Casebook received information from an eyewitness of the events described above. Here is his account:My name is Garel W. White, Retired USAF and now living in the Seattle Area.  I don’t know if you will get this response, but over the years it has become more clear than confusing about the nature of the Wurtsmith UFO incident in October 1975.  Reading about the incident in the early years suggested I was not telling the truth until I now read that 2 UFOs were in the area and split up while being chased by a KC 135 Tanker. One shot toward Saginaw and the other found its way over to our Capehart Gate Housing Area and Motor pool and Munitions Storage.  This is where I became clear on the incident because even in your current story you key on the Capehart Housing Gate Flyover.  Here is my story.   Garel W. White, Sgt, stationed at the Main Gate, Wurtsmith AFB approx. 1020 hrs.; almost ½ hour of initially being posted there for the Midnight Shift.  I never really noticed the extra activity over the radio because I was busy controlling the small rush of vehicles entering the installation and was normal for that time.  I got a call on the Hot Phone from the Command Post and answered it. The Command Post asked me if I saw anything over the Lake (Lake Huron) just like that! I looked and saw a bright white light that looked similar to the Planet Venus low in the sky. I reported that to the Command Post and they told me to keep an eye on it and they could give me no more information when I asked what was up?  I thought nothing of that and continued to my duty with on-coming vehicle traffic entering the base.  Approx. 10 minutes later the Hot Phone rang again. This time I glanced up and noticed it was not the Planet Venus low in the sky.  It was larger and appeared to be coming toward landfall of the Michigan shoreline. I watched it for about a few more minutes as the traffic coming on base died down and I could pay more attention to it. I noticed another Security Police Vehicle approach with my Squadron Commander Major?  I can’t remember his name but I can get it. The white light was approx. 5 miles away when the Major and I watched it approach.   I noticed some red lights and a slight swooshing sound as it closed in and stopped almost centered over the Main Gate (Less than 100 feet to the right of the Main Gate)  about 150 feet in the air.  It was a piercing white light; so bright you could not see behind it, around it, over it, etc.  I felt it was low enough I could pick up a rock and hit it. At this time no traffic entered the base.  I stepped off the platform of the Entry Control area, walked about 100 feet from the Main Gate directly under the blinding white light. It stayed there for more than 5 minutes; whoosh, whoosh, whoosh in 3 second intervals was the only sound I heard.  The Major walked over and we were both perplexed to what it was.  We were both directly under it.  This was for a little less than 5 minutes. I walked back to the gate and it began to move slowly approx. 2 to 3 mph down the roadway direct line toward the flight line, about 2 miles away from the Christmas Tree Alert B-52s and Alert KC-135 Tankers, illuminating the roadway as it went until approx. 3 blocks away the light went out, then lots of radio traffic. I don’t know where Michael Meyers was, but he did stop by and compared notes with me.  The Major departed after the lights went out to the Command Post.  I was told not to speak of the incident, and I didn’t until I was going to retire at Grissom AFB, INDIANA in 1990.  I told a batch of new 1st year troops of the encounter with a UFO when I was in my first 4 years of service.  They said I was pulling their leg until one of them went to his room and came back with a “TIME LIFE” Book on UFOs and listed under Malstrom AFB UFO was word for word of the UFO account except it only said Capehart Housing and not the Main Gate encounter. I’ve sort of kept my mouth shut until 2003 when I noticed the KC-135 was chasing 2 UFOs in a story starting from Loring AFB and wound up at Malstrom AFB.  (I saw the 2nd one!). Now I feel better about the whole incident. ', '1975, Abduction of Air Force Sergeant Charles L. MoodyA Monon railroad train crew reported seeing a UFO in north central Indiana. It was about 3.20 A.M. on Friday October 3, 1958... freight train no. 91 was enroute southbound from Monon, to Indianapolis. In the cab of the diesel locomotive were three men - Harry Eckman, the engineer, Cecil Bridge, the fireman, and Morris Ott, the head brakeman. Ed Robinson, the conductor, and Paul Sosbey, the flagman, were in the caboose. Cecil Bridge, the fireman, a former air force man with 450 hours of heavy bomber time, begins the story as follows... ""... we had just pulled past a little spot called Owasco. There\'s no town there - just a kind of crossroads. It was there we first noticed four lights in the sky ahead of us. They were moving lights. ""About that time the lights veered west. They crossed the tracks ahead of the train - about a half a mile ahead of us, we estimated. They were moving pretty slowly, too, at no more than about 50 miles an hour, four big, white, soft lights.""""Just the three of us in the engine saw the lights at this time. We were pulling 56 cars - that\'s a little more than half a mile of cars - and because of the angle at which these things were approaching and because they were so low right then, the boys in the caboose probably couldn\'t see them.""""...I talked to Robinson, (the conductor), and told him what we had seen. During the time we watched these things, from Ewasco to Kirklin, we did a lot of talking on that radio. The dispatcher in Lafayette could hear us, of course, but he never cut in. Conductor Robinson continues the story. ""I was sitting in the cupola, looking forward over the train, when Bridge called me on the radio. I had already noticed the four gobs of light but I couldn\'t make out what they were. They were half a mile ahead of the caboose - the whole length of the train. A little bit after he called me the things went away and we didn\'t see them for a few minutes... then all of a sudden they came back.""""I\'d say they were only a couple of hundred feet above the train as they came toward the caboose. And they weren\'t moving very fast - maybe 30 or 40 miles an hour. It was hard to tell - a fellow just doesn\'t notice details like that under the circumstances.""""The freight train is pretty noisy, of course, but I didn\'t hear any other noise, like the roar an airplane would have made. I think they were silent, or nearly silent, at least.""""They flew over us one after the other - big, round white things that looked about the colour of fluorescent lights, kind of fuzzy around the edges. They didn\'t glare and they didn\'t light up things as they went over. They just came back toward us, over the top of the cars, one after the other. Then they went on down the tracks maybe another half a mile and seemed to stop.""""Sosbey and I went out on the back platform where we could see them better, but they were getting pretty far behind us. We could see their lights but I don\'t remember whether they were bunched up or not. They were just there, we know that. We could see them behind us, right over the tracks.Cecil Bridge, observing the same objects from the engine, describes what he and the engineer and head brakeman saw. ""When these things shot back over to the east of us, they lit up much brighter than they were before. They turned in line, going north or northeast and we noticed that they lit up in sequence - the front one first, then number two, three and four. They changed course and came back past the train. They were going in the opposite direction to us when they made this pass. I guess they were at least a mile or two east of us when they did it.""The conductor, Ed Robinson, agreed with this description. He added: ""We didn\'t see them from the back end of the train for several minutes after they went away to the east and turned. But the boys in the engine were still seeing them. I got back on the radio with Bridge. He was watching them right then. They must have circled the train and gone north of us, real low, because the next time we saw them they came rushing up the tracks right in back of us. They were coming a lot faster this time - a lot faster than they had come back over the train the first time.""They were just above the tree-tops along the right of way, and they had changed their way of flying -- their formation. This time they were sort of flying on edge. Two of them were on edge - the two in the middle. The two on the outside were tilted at an angle both in the same direction. The four of them flew like that up the tracks behind the train - a tilted one on the east, two of them straight up and down, then the one on the west tilted just like the one on the east.""When they first came back over the train we could see that they were round things - circular shaped on the bottom. Then when they flew up the tracks in back of us we could see - Sosbey and I - that they were about 40 feet in diameter and maybe 10 feet thick. The two flying straight up and down were approximately over the edges of the right of way and about 200 yards in back of the caboose. If they had been flying flat down instead of edgewise. They would have just about have touched edges so they must have seen somewhere around 40 feet across the bottom.""Fireman Cecil Bridge continues: ""We had flashlights in the engine and in the caboose. Up on the head end of the train - in the engine where I was --we blinked our flashlights at the things and we waved the lights. We thought we might get them to come in closer. They did come down over the train a few minutes later, as Robinson related, but of course, I can\'t say they did it because we flashed the lights at them. At any rate they didn\'t flash any lights back at us.""""In the caboose we had a five cell sealed beam flashlight that throws a pretty good beam a long ways. When the things came down and flew right up the tracks behind the caboose, I grabbed that sealed beam flashlight and shined it on them. As soon as the light hit them they jumped sideways out of the beam. When they got back over the tracks I did it it again and they scattered. They acted like they didn\'t care for that light at all.""From the time Bridge first called us on the radio until the last time we saw them near Kirklin (38 miles northwest of Indianapolis) it was about an hour and 10 minutes altogether. They hung around the back end of the train but after we shined the light on them they didn\'t come in close any more. While we were switching at Frankfort they stayed away back up the tracks, just hovered there, until we moved on. Then they followed us again. When they finally went away at Kirklin, they just zipped off to the northeast and kept on going and we didn\'t see them anymore."" written by Frank Edwards', 'Travis Walton Abduction, Part 1 1975Depiction of SightingThe UFO phenomena is generally given little if any serious consideration by those engaged in credible scientific studies. Without a doubt many so-called UFO sightings can easily be dismissed as misidentified craft, stars, planets, or just plain hoaxes perpetrated by thrill or money seeking individuals.Many books and studies have given us statistics on UFO reports, and roughly about 95% of the sightings can easily be explained away.Considering the great distances between stars, it is very easy to assume that the odds of a visit from another intelligence are extremely low. These assumptions are based, however, upon the extent of our knowledge, and should another race visit us, they would most certainly possess a higher degree of intelligence than we do. We are trying to judge a possibility while handicapped by the limits of what we know today.The 1993 release of the movie ""Fire In The Sky"" was intriguing to many who had waited for a screen presentation of Travis Walton\'s book by the same name. D. B. Sweeny and James Garner offered the film veteran actors. Those familiar with the actual story were less than impressed with the film\'s inability to take the full account to the screen.Those who were not privy to the actual story may have thought it only fiction. There are some great sets, and special effects, but the story is not done justice. My goal in this article, is to present the facts behind the movie; the real story of the abduction of Travis Walton. I ask only one thing of you the reader, reserve final judgment until you have read all the facts.Apache Sitgreaves National Forest This baffling UFO case began on November 5th, 1975, in northeastern Arizona\'s Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. A logging crew of 7 men were working on a government contract, clearing forest. The men loaded into a single pickup truck leaving work for the day. As they started their journey home they saw, not far from the road, a ""luminous object, shaped like a flattened disc.""All of the men agreed that Travis Walton, captivated by the sight, left the truck to get a closer look. While gazing up in awe at the object, suddenly a brilliant, bluish light struck him and threw him to the ground some distance away.This event caused the other crew members to flee the scene in fear for their lives. After arguing among themselves, they decided to go back and see if they could help Travis. Returning to the scene, they found no trace of the craft, or Travis.A personal friend of Travis\', Mike Rogers, was the crew foreman, and driver of the truck. According to Rogers, as the men fled the scene, he looked back and saw a ""luminous object"" lift out of the forest, and disappear toward the horizon. Rogers and the other 5 workers eventually would take a lie detector test. The men passed the examination, save for one inconclusive, and soon the case exploded into the national spotlight.Walton reappeared five days later, confused and scared, with fleeting memories of alien entities, and descriptions of the inside of their craft.He was also subsequently subjected to a number of polygraph examinations. The Travis Walton event would soon become the very first abduction case to be given serious consideration by many credible scientists. His story would force the general public to reevaluate previously close minded opinions on the subject.The six witnesses, Allen Dalis, Dwayne Smith, John Goulette, Kenneth Peterson, Mike Rogers, and Steve Pierce, of this controversial case, described the craft in personal, yet similar terms. Rogers\' description depicts the craft as a ""large, glowing object hovering in the air below the treetops about 100 feet away.""Dwayne Smith described the craft as ""smooth and giving off a yellowish-orange light.""Additional eyewitness accounts added the following: ""unbelievably smooth,"" ""a flattened disc with ""edges clearly defined.""Walton and Rogers both estimated that the craft was about 20 feet in overall diameter.Travis Walton, c. 1975 The details of the event quoted from the investigator\'s report are as follows: As Walton approached on foot across the clearing, the ""UFO began to wobble or rock slightly,"" and then emitted a ""bluish light from the machine... a blue ray shot out of the bottom of that thing and hit him all over,"" ""that ray was the brightest thing I\'ve ever seen.""This light sent Walton ""backward through the air ten feet,"" ""hurled through the air in a backwards motion, falling on the ground, on his back,"" ""flying -- like he\'d touched a live wire.""""The horror was unreal.""Polygrapher Cy Gilson relates from his documents the following:Testimony from Allen Dalis: ""During the pretest interview, Mr. Dalis related the following events that occurred on that day. Mr. Dalis said they had finished work for the day and were heading home. It was almost dark. He saw a glow coming from among the trees ahead of them.As they came to a clearing, he saw an object he called a UFO. Mr. Rogers was slowing the truck down to stop as Travis Walton exited the truck and began to advance towards the UFO in a brisk walk...Mr. Dalis described the UFO as being a yellowish-white in color. He said the light emitting from it was not bright, but a glow that gave off light all around itself.Mr. Dalis saw Walton reach the UFO, stop and look up at it.He said it looked as if Walton was standing there, slightly bent over, with his hands in his pockets.Mr. Dalis said the UFO began to wobble or rock slightly and he began to become afraid. He put his head down towards his knees. As he did so, a bright light flashed that lit up the area, even the inside of the truck.He immediately looked towards the UFO. He saw a silhouette of Walton. Mr. Walton had his arms up in the air... Mr. Dalis turned towards Mr. Rogers who was in the driver\'s seat and yelled for him to ""get the hell out of here...""Sworn testimony by Mike Rogers: ""... he was on the opposite side of the truck from the UFO. He had to bend over slightly to view it in its entirety through the truck windows. He described the UFO to be glowing a yellowish-tan color. He could not say if the light emanated from within the UFO, or was a lighting system outside, that lit up the UFO.He did say he could see the shadows of the trees on the ground, around the UFO. He said it was round and about 20 feet in diameter.He said the UFO was about 75 to 100 feet from the truck...As Mr. Rogers started to move the truck, a brilliant flash of light lit up the entire area, even inside the truck. It was described as a prolonged strobe flash. He did not see a beam of light emit from the UFO and hit Walton.As the flash occurred, Mr. Rogers turned around in his seat to look at the UFO again and saw Mr. Walton being hurled through the air in a backwards motion, falling on the ground, on his back. At this time, Mr. Dalis and someone else yelled to ""get the hell out of here...""Upon returning to the scene, the crewmen searched briefly through the woods, calling Walton\'s name. They then proceeded down to the main road and after some debate, decided to call the police and ask for assistance. They were first met by a Deputy Ellison and subsequently by Sheriff Marlin Gillespie, who would later describe the crewmen as apparently sincerely distressed.The officers and crewmen went back up the hill and searched again with flashlights, eventually calling off the search and making plans for a more thorough manhunt beginning early the next morning.The next several days were marked by unsuccessful searches for the missing Walton, including some use of helicopters and dogs. Temperatures dropped below zero the first two nights of the search, creating fear that, if Walton was injured and disoriented, he may not survive.Meanwhile, law enforcement officials were looking for alternate explanations of the event, including thepossibility that Walton had been murdered.Law enforcement, looking for a more believable explanation than a flying saucer, began a thorough investigation of the facts. All six remaining members of the crew were questioned over and over again. Family members and friends were also interrogated.One fact that colored this questioning was that all of the men were unlearned, everyday working people, noted to be a little ""rough around the edges.""This, of course, is a typical assumption by some that those who have not been successful financially in this world are all liars, cheats, and can\'t be trusted.One common theory at the time was that Dalis and Walton had fought, and that Dalis had either accidentally or purposely killed Walton, and hid his body. The problem with this theory was that if a murder had taken place, why would the other 5 crewmen risk the fires of justice to cover for Dalis.A second theory put forth at the onset was that possibly all of the crewmen had been involved in some kind of brawl or argument, and accidentally killed Travis, hiding his body somewhere in the vast forest.If this was true, why concoct a story involving a UFO abduction, being one of the most unbelievable stories one could put forth.Another scenario offered by some was that since the crew was behind on their government contract, they were looking for an excuse to get out of it. Again, why this most bizarre story?In their initial reports, the 6 crewmen had indicated a willingness to undergo any kind of lie detection test to establish their truthfulness. After the second day of searching, law enforcement officials brought in Cy Gilson, a polygraph examiner from the Department of Public Safety (associated with the state police), to test all the crewman.Five of the witnesses passed this polygraph examination, while for the sixth, Allen Dalis, the test was ruled inconclusive (unable to assign a reading).While the successful tests fueled media interest in the case, the inconclusive result for Dalis put some heat on him personally. While some of the crew members, such as Rogers and Walton, had been friends long before the forest service brush-clearing contract, the others were only acquaintances, and in the case of Allen Dalis, he and Walton were said to have had some personal animosities between them.If Walton had been involved somehow in a conspiracy to deceive authorities, he certainly left his closest family members out of the loop. At approximately 1:30 AM on the morning of Nov. 6, crew members Coplan and Rogers went to notify Walton\'s mother, Mary Kellett, of her son\'s disappearance.Mrs. Kellett\'s calm response upon being awakened and told her youngest son had been kidnapped by a UFO was ""Well, that\'s the way these things happen,"" and then she proceeded to described two instances when she and her oldest son, Duane, had also seen UFOs.Later that morning (approximately 3:00 AM) when Mrs. Kellett told Walton\'s sister, Mrs. Grant Neff, that ""a flying saucer got him [Travis],"" Mrs. Neff surprised Coplan with how calmly she also took the news. The rest of that day was taken up by an extensive search of the area where Walton had disappeared.Curiously absent from the site was any physical evidence of anything happening, in spite of the ""explosive"" force of the blue-green beam. No blood, no shreds of clothing, no evidence of the blast effects was found by any of the nearly fifty searchers involved. Neither was any evidence found of any violent confrontations among the crew members. There was no trace of Travis Walton.For as many UFO proponents there are, there are that many and more debunkers. The authorities tried to keep the scene of the incident for serious forensic examination, but the mass influx of people, not only local, but world-wide, made this an impossibility. The crewmen\'s stories were treated with mixed opinion.Some marveled to hear what they had seen, and some called them ""pranksters"" and ""liars.""Some even went as far as to suggest that the whole account was nothing more than a joke gone bad, and that Travis was hiding somewhere and would suddenly reappear on cue. At this stage of the investigation there was one question on the minds of all involved, whether friend or foe;The last thing that Walton remembered about the incident in the woods was the feeling of going backwards, and then nothing. Nothing that is, until he awoke in pain, frozen in pain, with an overwhelming thirst. Slowly making out the image of some kind of light, he comes to the realization that he is lying on a table of some kind.Still very weak, Walton realizes ""Oh, My God, the hospital, they brought me to the hospital."" Sweating from the moist humid air, he finds that he is uncomfortable because he is still in his work gear, and his jacket is pushed up under his arms. ""I wonder why the nurse didn\'t at least take my jacket off?""Feeling a strange looking device curved around his body, he tries to focus his vision on the blurry figures of the doctors and nurses who certainly had come to his aid. His vision clearing, he suddenly sees who is there; to his shock he is staring into the face of a... horrible creature!There were three of them, gazing right back at him with luminous brown pupils the size of quarters. Travis attempts to push one of them away with what little strength he has at the time. Strangely the creature shoots backward with ease. ""It felt spongy and soft,"" he would later relate. Bringing himself to his feet, Travis readied himself for a fight, like a caged animal. Looking for something to defend himself with, he grabs an unfamiliar looking tube and tries to scare his captors with it.Screaming to the three entities, ""Keep back, damn you!"" they stopped in their tracks. The beings were a little under 5 ft. in height, with a basic humanoid appearance. They were thin, puny, covered with marshmallow looking skin. Their small hands were delicate and without nails. Totally bald, their heads were disproportionately large for their little bodies.The only facial features that didn\'t appear underdeveloped were those incredible eyes! Those glistening orbs had brown irises twice the size of those of a normal human\'s eye, nearly an inch in diameter! The iris was so large that even parts of the pupils were hidden by the lids, giving the eyes a certain catlike appearance. There was very little of the white part of the eye showing. They had no lashes and no eyebrows. Their little mouths never moved. Travis was ready for the fight of his life. Suddenly, inexplicably, the aliens left the room through an open door. ""I have to get out of here,"" he thought.Looking through a curved hallway opening from the room, he saw no one in sight. Frantically searching as he moved, he passed a doorway, and then thought; ""Should I go back, did I miss a chance to escape?"" Cautiously approaching the room, he looked in and saw a circular room with a domed roof, and three rectangular doorways which were shut.The room was empty except for one chair facing away from him. Could someone be sitting in the chair, out of his view? He circled the room, watching the chair, never wanting to see one of those hideous creatures again. Finally convinced that the chair was unoccupied, he began to move toward it.A strange thing began to happen! The closer to the center of the room he got, the darker the room became. Small points of light began to appear on, or through, the wall of the room. He could see stars! Depiction of Sighting, Drawing by Mike Rogers Experimenting with strange looking controls on the chair, he felt afraid that he might draw attention to himself, so the got up, and left the chair. As he walked to the edge of the room, the stars which were once visible faded out, and the surfaces of the wall, ceiling, and floor became visible.Approaching one of the rectangular doors, he searched for some kind of control to open it, but found none. Walking back to the chair, Travis hears a faint sound, a door opens, and standing before him is a human being!This man was over 6 ft tall, and muscularly built. Running up to him, Travis starts asking questions. No sound came from the ""man."" The man took Travis by the arm, leading him down a narrow hallway. Stopping in front of a door that suddenly opened itself, they entered a small, bare room. Again Travis tried to get a response from the man, but his efforts fell on deaf ears.Travis spent only a couple of minutes in the small room, and then another doorway opened. From the opened doorway, nice fresh air came in. Next Travis proceeded down a ramp to a floor. Looking back he could see the craft that he had just exited. This craft was much larger than the one he had seen in the woods. He estimated the diameter at about 60 feet.He had now left the large craft, and entered a large room. Within this room he could see several other smaller saucer-type crafts. Travis was now taken through a hallway to another set of doors, which also automatically opened. Through this door he entered a totally white room with a table and a chair. Travis\' attention was immediately drawn to three other humans in the room.This time there were two men and a woman. These three had similar characteristics to the first human he had seen. All four of them had a family like similarity. Travis again tried to initiate a conversation, but again to no avail. Travis asked a couple of questions along the lines of; ""Would somebody please tell me where I am?"" ""What in hell is going on? What is this place?""The woman and one of the men took Travis by the arm and led him to a table. Travis became frightened wondering what they were going to do. All three of the men gently pushed Travis back on the table. The woman had an object that resembled an oxygen mask, yet no tubes were attached to it, only a small black golfball sized sphere.Travis tried to push the mask away, but suddenly felt weak, and next came nothing but blackness. One thought came to him before consciousness left him; ""What happens next?""Back in town, the investigation of the disappearance of Travis Walton was nothing short of mass confusion. The town of Snowflake had been swamped by newspaper and television reporters from all over the world. Everybody took a side. It seemed at the time that opinions were equally split. One side thought; ""This whole mess will be over as soon as they find his body."" The other side thought; ""Where in the world is Travis hiding, and when will he come back?"" Neither side had long to wait.The continuing search for Travis turned up absolutely nothing except innuendo and theory. All speculation would be put to the test, when 5 days after allegedly being hit with a beam from some sort of unusual flying craft, Travis suddenly reappeared.Travis stated; ""Consciousness returned to me on the night I awoke to find myself on the cold pavement west of Heber, Arizona. I was lying on my stomach, my head on my right forearm. Cold air brought me instantly awake. I looked up in time to see a light turn off on the bottom of a curved, gleaming hull. As I raised my head up, a white light caught my eye just before it blinked off. Either a light had been turned off or a hatch had closed, cutting off the light from inside. I only caught a glimpse as I raised my head; I could not be sure which it was.""Travis continued: ""Then I saw the mirrored outline of a rounded, silvery disc hovering four feet above the paved surface of the road. It must have been about forty feet in diameter because it extended several feet off the left side of the road. It was too large for the highway and it extended past the roadside to my left to clear a cutaway rock embankment on the other side of the highway. It appeared to be about fourteen feet high in the center.""Travis continued; ""For an instant it floated silently above the road, a dozen yards away. I could see the night sky, the surrounding trees, and the highway center line reflected in the curving mirror of its hull. I noticed a faint warmth radiating onto my face. Then, abruptly, it shot vertically into the sky, creating a strong breeze that stirred the nearby pine boughs and rustled the dry oak leaves that lay in the dry grass beside the road. It gave off no light; and it was almost instantly lost from sight. The most striking thing about its departure was its quietness. It seemed impossible that something so large, moving through the atmosphere at such speed, would not have shrieked through the air, or even broken the sound barrier with a sonic boom. Yet it had been totally silent!""""I scrambled shakily to my feet. My legs felt rubbery. I swayed, then caught my balance. I looked around and recognized the deserted stretch of curving road as the highway that wound down the canyon into Heber from the West. I ran wildly down the deserted highway, across the bridge into Heber, stopping at the new building across from the Union 76 service station.No one answered my desperate knocking. No cars passed by. I ran down the highway, over the second bridge, to the row of telephone booths at the Exxon station. I dialed the operator (a dime was not required to reach an operator in our part of the country) and panted out the number of my sister. She was the only nearby relative with a telephone. My brother-in-law Grant answered.""""It was 12:05 A.M. I was in an incredible mental state, difficult to describe. As best I can remember, I shouted something like: \'They brought me back!\' Then I babbled, I\'m out here in Heber, please get somebody to come and get me! My hand shook as I held the cold receiver. Grant was not amused. He took this call to be another cruel joke. Uh, I think you have the wrong number, he replied sarcastically, starting to hang up."" Travis Walton 1998 ""Wait! It\'s me, Travis!"" I screamed hysterically into the receiver. ""Where are you?"" he asked, still suspicious of a joke. ""I\'m at the Heber Exxon station."" ""Okay,"" he replied, almost apologetically, yet still cautious of a prank. ""Stay right there. I\'ll come and get you. Just hang on.""Grant drove the three miles from Taylor over to Snowflake and found my brother Duane at Mom\'s house. He told Duane about the call, and of his doubts it was really me. Duane, too, thought the call might have been yet another example of someone\'s idiotic concept of humor. But they decided they couldn\'t risk not investigating. They set out for Heber, thirty-three miles away.""Lights suddenly shone into the phone booth. Relief flooded over me when I raised my head and saw the headlights of Duane\'s pickup. Duane and Grant got out and came to where I was still slumped in the phone booth. Duane opened the glass door of the booth and helped me to my feet. ""Am I ever glad to see you!"" Grant said. Duane helped me into the warm truck and asked Grant to drive. On the way to Snowflake I tried to tell them about what happened to me, but I just couldn\'t get it all out.""They were awful; white skin; great big eyes...I sobbed in horror. Take it easy, Travis, you\'re all right now. They didn\'t harm you, did they? No . . . but those eyes, those horrible eyes! They just kept looking at me! Just so you\'re okay, that\'s all that counts, Duane said. Everyone has been worried sick about you. If it\'s already after midnight, I must have been unconscious for a couple of hours, I replied shakily. Because I only remember about an hour or an hour and a half inside that thing.""Duane and Grant looked at me strangely. ""Travis, feel your face,"" Duane said.""Good heavens, I just shaved this morning and it feels like a week\'s growth!"" I exclaimed, still not comprehending.""Travis, Duane said gently, You\'ve been missing for five days!""After Travis was found, the first consideration of family and friends was his health. Only a few bruises and scrapes marred him physically. His mental condition? That was a different story. Travis\' older brother Duane tried to protect him, and handle the authorities, but was ill-equipped for what was to come. UFO research groups descended on the family, local and state police were hungry for some answers. Profiteers, racketeers, freaks, debunkers, and skeptics all wanted a piece of Travis and his story.Already angry at thinking they had been hoodwinked, they couldn\'t wait to say ""I told you so,"" ""I knew it was a hoax,"" ""They were all a bunch of loons."" Was this another fraudulent, stupid story of ""little green men""? The collusion of National Enquirer and APRO would have an adverse effect on the case. Did they care whether or not the story was real? Or were they interested only in selling papers? The research group APRO had a reputation of being a fair and open-minded organization, but were not able to investigate all UFO reports.They had to be choosy, and look into the most credible cases only. Not especially overflowing with financial backing, they were put into the position of having to rely on The National Enquirer bankrolling the investigation in exchange for the exclusive rights to publishing it.Rushing Travis to a lie-detector test was a mistake. Still in a state of mental confusion, he was unsure exactly what had happened. He only recalled bits and pieces of information at first, but in time his memory slowly returned. Travis\' first lie-detector test showed deception. Subsequently he would pass 12 others, one as late as 1993, some 18 years after the fact. It would seem incredibly strange that 5 witnesses of an event would pass an examination, with 1 inconclusive, and the victim of the event itself fail. It should be noted that all of the witnesses subsequently passed all lie-detector tests given them.It was also reported that one of the crewmen was offered $10,000.00 to say the whole case was fabricated. Though certainly tempted by the huge sum of money, he stuck to his original assertion. The Dalis test was also tainted by the fact that he was allegedly wanted for questioning relating to a crime, and also had some family problems unresolved, like a fairly large sum of back child support. His name in the papers would most assuredly alert searching family members and authorities to his whereabouts.In my own research for these articles, I have searched through literally hundreds of reports, both pro and con. It is amazing that even some of the larger, more reputable movie and book review sites (not naming names), don\'t even have some of the basic facts of the case correct. I have seen different numbers of crewmen listed, anywhere from 3-7, when the actual police report lists all 7 men (including Walton) with their names, addresses, etc. This is only one area of misinformation. Taking into account all of the information available at this time, there are some facts of the case which are irrefutable;1) Despite allegations of a hoax by many, NO ONE has brought forth any proof to substantiate their claims.2) Despite a massive search by approximately 50 volunteers aided by dogs and helicopters, NO physical trace of Travis Walton was found during the 5 days of his disappearance.3) During the 25 years since the case began, not ONE person has brought forth any information indicating where Travis was, or even alleged a possible sighting of him during the five days.4) Law enforcement officials, though claiming hoax all the while, never presented ANY evidence to put a dent in one of the crewmen\'s statements, which remain the same to this day.5) From a theoretical standpoint, it is highly unlikely that 7 men, common everyday working men, could put together an elaborate hoax, pass lie-detector tests, stand up to questioning, and stick to the same incredible story for a quarter of a century, without a break. The stress of the investigation caused personal problems among the men, yet they still stuck to their stories.6) Though Walton did receive money for his story, it was not until many years later that he gained financially from it. Reviewing all the facts presented to date, it is also advisable to mention that it is easier to prove that something happened, than to prove that it didn\'t. It is also very easy to simply yell ""Hoax,"" without tenable proof.However, in the shadow of all of the crewmen\'s statements to date, it is fair to say that something very extraordinary and unusual did happen on November 5th, 1975 in the remote forests of Arizona. The Travis Walton Story, ""Fire In The Sky,"" remains one of the most intriguing reports of UFO abduction today.""It was many years ago that I got out of a crew truck in the national forest and ran toward a large glowing UFO hovering in the darkening Arizona sky. But when I made that fateful choice to leave the truck, I was leaving behind more than just my six fellow workmen. I was leaving behind forever all semblance of a normal life, running headlong toward an experience so overwhelmingly mind-rending in it\'s effects, so devastating in its aftermath, that my life would never - could never - be the same again.""

1949, ,"['1949, Norwood, Ohio Searchlight UFO Incident     NORWOOD AND PROJECT GRUDGE Could someone help explain if any reference to the 1949 Norwood Searchlight/UFO incident does or does not appear in Project Grudge files?  The Norwood case involves 10 visual sightings by multiple civilian, clergy, police, scientist and military witnesses over a 7-month duration, facilitated by the use of a powerful searchlight ran by Army Sgt. Donald R. Berger. The first sighting took place during ""The Jitney Carnival"" of 1949 and witnessed by hundreds The following morning, three local newspapers- The Cincinnati Post, The Cincinnati Enquirer and The Cincinnati Times Star- all had articles regarding \'strange lights\' and \'comets seen over the city\' from the previous evening.  There was an explanation for the occurrence, according to one local newspaper. The Albee Theater in nearby Cincinnati, accompanied by the Ss. Peter & Paul Church in Norwood, were operating searchlights. It was said that the hundreds of persons calling newspapers and weather bureau officials were simply observing these searchlight beams \'bouncing off of clouds.\'  Despite this, the sightings began in earnest after 11:00 p.m. (Berger logs indicate that he observed the UFO from 8:15 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.) and continued to flummox Cincinnati residents until 6:30 a.m. the following morning. It seems unlikely searchlights would be operating all night long until daylight, and further still, one weather bureau official recounted his early-morning observation of two objects that looked like ""two weather ceiling balloons"" that weren\'t moving despite a wind speed of 25 to 32-miles per hour.  Even the Berger logs indicate the possible presence of a second searchlight from that evening, whether Berger knew there was another searchlight at work or not. ""When I moved the searchlight away, the object continued to glow,"" Berger wrote in his 1949 logs that were later kept in the possession of Rev. Gregory Miller until 1954, when he imparted them to UFO investigator Leonard Stringfield.  Meanwhile, during the festival in Norwood, Robert Linn, the managing editor of the Cincinnati Post, along with church pastor Rev. Gregory Miller, were certain that Berger\'s searchlight had found and been bouncing off of ""some definite object."" They entered into agreement and reported the situation to intelligence officials at Wright Field in nearby Dayton, Ohio.  The August 19th episode is a mass-witness case, reported in all three local newspapers of Cincinnati, Ohio, a city not far south of Dayton, home of the airbase. A possible explanation is publicly toyed with: the deception caused by two searchlight beams strolling the dark skies. It seems as if Grudge folks would have likely been aware of the events at Norwood on August 19, 1949 - either from all the reportage or from the direct report to the airbase itself, by Robert Linn and Rev. Miller. Why does the Norwood Case not factor in to their investigation when, in fact, far \'lesser\' cases may have been prominently addressed? If Project Grudge had sought to dismiss UFO sightings as psychological phenomena, they had a good case with the Norwood searchlight events at this stage of the situation.

1974, ,"['The Carbondale UFO Crash, 11-11-1974The Reality, the Hoaxes and the LegendM.J. GraeberTHE WELL-PUBLICISED Kecksburg, Pennsylvania UFO crash of 1965 has been touted as ""Pennsylvania\'s Roswell"" and presented as a crash recovery story that has been shrouded in a veil of mystery and governmental conspiracy which is intended to keep the truth of the incident from the American people. But, Lackawanna County\'s city of Carbondale, Pennsylvania is also the location of a ""downed saucer incident"" that has caught the imagination and interests of ufologists and conspiracy enthusiasts throughout the nation. 9-11 November 2004 marked the 30th anniversary of Pennsylvania\'s other Roswell incident. - the legendary Carbondale UFO crash or perhaps, I should call it ""The Carbondale UFO Capers"".  As one of the three primary UFO investigators of the Carbondale saucer crash, I feel that it is time for me to present my recollections and reflections on this occurrence, as well as some thoughts on how and why the legend of the ill-fated Carbondale UFO has become a gleaming facet of contemporary ufological folklore. So, let me start my story at the beginning.I was working quite late on the night of 10 November 1974 (on a design project) and had sketches and blueprints scattered about on the dining room table and floor. It was a little after midnight, (actually 11 November) and I had been listening to a local radio talk show when the programme\'s host suddenly announced that his programme director had just handed him a note about an unidentified flying object which had apparently crashed at Carbondale, Pennsylvania.Since I had appeared on WWDB\'s Bernie Herman show several times discussing the UFO phenomenon, I phoned the station without hesitation and asked if the matter was legitimate or simply a prank. Both the show\'s host and his engineer assured me that the report was indeed ""authentic"" for they had just taken it directly from an Associated Press release.I then contacted the Carbondale police department about the situation and spoke to a desk officer who told me that an airborne object had been observed by a group of five teens (but only three of the youngsters actually participated in our inquiry of the sighting), and that the UFO apparently plummeted into a pond and sank. The youngsters agreed that a fiery object had fallen to earth in a shower of sparks and splashed down into a large coal breaker pit or \'silt pond\', as it was called by locals.The police had cordoned off the area in an attempt to keep curiosity seekers from possibly getting injured at the site, as two areas of the bank of the pond were rather steep and slippery. The acting police chief, Sgt Francis X. Dottle, confided that he didn\'t know what the object in the water was, but that he and a couple of his men had observed it glowing while submerged on the night of 9 November - and that it remained aglow until the wee morning hours of 10 November (i.e. for a period of about six to eight hours.As I later learned, the teens who observed the phenomenon saw a fiery object streak across the sky, ""Coming over Salem Mountain"" in the direction of Russell Park. According to the boys, they ran into the park from their street corner location where they were just hanging around on a ""nothing else to do"" Saturday night and discovered a strange light glowing in the pond about twenty feet. from shore. The boys had run about two blocks to the pond and didn\'t actually see or hear the object hit the water. There was a faint ""fizz"" or sizzling sound heard, however, and one of the lads said that ""it sounded like someone had thrown a cigarette in the water."" So, too, one boy thought the pond had an odour ""like gas from a gas stove"", while another boy said that ""the pond just smelled like it usually does"".The mysterious airborne object was described as being bright whitish-yellow in colour with a trail of reddish sparks. It was estimated to appear about as large as a five cent piece (a nickel) held at arm\'s length. But one of the boys would later say that it was about ""three times the size of a basketball"". No sounds were noted by the teens as the object appeared to fall towards the earth, and they didn\'t see a trail of smoke coming from it either. One boy said, ""It looked like a shooting star"". However, later versions of the story credit the boys with saying the object whistled as it sped earthward.The boys left the pond to report the submerged light to the police about 7:00 p.m. and when they returned to the pond (around 15 minutes later) they thought that the light had taken up another position in the water, although no one actually saw the light moving at that time. The light was described as being yellow-orange in colour by two of the boys, while the third witness described it as ""yellowish, almost white"". The light on the water\'s surface appeared as an irregular disc about 5 feet in diameter. While several UFO researchers would later describe it as being an irregular shaped glow at 20 feet in diameter, I performed a very simple experiment with a flashlight in a darkened room and discovered that the central portion of the light\'s beam appeared to be about five feet in diameter (when directed at the ceiling) and its outer, fainter, and more widely dispersed light beam was about 4 times larger. This may account for the discrepancy in the estimates concerning the diameter of the glow on the pond\'s surface - or perhaps, the later researchers may have misinterpreted the boys\' statements regarding the ""position"" of the light from shore, which was initially reported to be about twenty feet.I asked the officer on the phone if the object might have been a small private plane, fearing that someone may have been trapped in an air-pocket within the fuselage\'s wreckage. He said that the reports indicated that the object\'s tremendous speed and the lack of floating debris on the water seemed to deny that possibility. I then asked if the object could have been some sort of ""space junk"" and informed him that there were military tracking installations such as NORAD that should be contacted in regard to the situation. My primary concern was that if the object were some part of an American or Soviet spacecraft or satellite which hadn\'t completely burned up as it re-entered the Earth\'s atmosphere, there may have been a possibility that some portion of its electrical system was still being powered by the ""snap units"" (or nuclear batteries) that were used to power various on-board instrumentation and guidance systems.This seemed to be highly improbable, but, then again, there was that strange light beneath the pond\'s surface, a light which appeared to pulsate with diminishing intensity and at one point suddenly rushed towards a small boat which police had launched to further investigate the matter. But, unknown to me at that time, Sgt Dottle (the Acting Police Chief) had already been in contact with Dr J. Allen Hynek\'s Center for UFO Studies in Evanston, Illinois about the situation.Dr Hynek advised Sgt Dottle that a meteor or a meteor fragment could not be the source of the light in the pond because burning meteors are immediately extinguished when they strike bodies of water. Sgt Dottle was further advised to obtain a Geiger counter to see if any radioactivity was present at the crash site, perhaps as a result of a faulty spacecraft or satellite re-entry. Obviously, Dr. Hynek also feared that a snap unit had survived the re-entry and may have been leaking its contents into the pond.Upon hanging up the phone, I awoke my wife, Grace, kissed her and our sleeping children goodbye, and started the early morning trek along the north-eastern extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike toward Carbondale. As I drove through the Lehigh Valley I was still listening to radio news reports concerning the incident - and while some of the accounts seemed to be a bit sketchy, there were relatives of Carbondale residents phoning the radio station with additional information and some obvious rumours too.As the events of the Carbondale saucer crash unfolded, the rumours would include suspicions that a Soviet missile was in the pond, that only a portion of a Soviet missile was in the pond, while still another section had crashed into Elk Lake about 25 miles north-west of Carbondale. There was also a rumour that an alien space ship had landed - not crashed - in the silt pond and that the military had managed to recover whatever was in the water and spirit it away before anyone had an opportunity to see it (i.e., the story was beginning to take on characteristics of the earlier Kecksburg, Aztec and Roswell UFO crash reports). In one rumour scenario, the UFO was loaded upon a flatbed railcar that was brought to the site on a nearby (albeit, long abandoned) railroad spur - and in another account, two military helicopters were used to lift the object from the water and place it in an armoured truck. Curiously, I too became linked to a rather ridiculous rumour which placed me at the scene as a government agent or high ranking Air Force officer disguised as a UFO field investigator.But the truth was that I was just a guy who had an interest in the UFO phenomenon and had been investigating sighting reports for about two years prior to the incident. I had been in the US Army 12 years earlier, as a specialist Fourth Class (i.e. not quite the equivalent of a corporal) in the infantry. I founded UFORIC, the Philadelphia-based UFO Report and Information Center, in 1972 and served as its director until 1980. I also swept the office floor and emptied the waste paper basket. I was simply a student of the phenomenon, not a self-proclaimed expert, and I went to Carbondale because the reported incident interested me. UFORIC was a very small research organisation, consisting of only five volunteer investigators. Many of our reports were passed on to us by technicians at the Philadelphia Franklin Institute\'s Fels Planetarium, several police departments, both commercial and military air facilities and two local newspapers - while direct calls from the public were also received and routinely investigated.As I entered the community of Carbondale, about 4:30 - 5:00 a.m. on the morning of 11 November, I asked directions to the police station and briefly conferred with detective sergeant Dottle. He informed me that Dr Hynek was dispatching a UFO field investigator from New York State to assist the police in their efforts to identify and possibly recover the object in the pond. Sgt Dottle then asked if I would assist him until Dr Hynek\'s representative arrived and I agreed to do so. I was then taken to the crash site which was cordoned off by two Carbondale police officers and a group of youngsters who were members of the Civil Air Patrol (i.e., aeronautical boy scouts).There were not any armed troops or technical military contingents of any kind present. But I did briefly speak to an Air Force officer (a major or lieutenant-colonel) at the pond much later in the day. I believe that he was involved with the Civil Air Patrol\'s community service related activities at the scene. I think that the officer\'s name tag read ""Merriman"". (?) Anyway, several volunteer fire companies from neighbouring communities were summoned and they assisted in the recovery efforts by pumping thousands of gallons of water from the pond as Sgt Dottle, Dr Hynek\'s investigator, Mr Dains, Mr Barry of the 20th Century UFO Bureau and I felt that this was a far safer method of obtaining a look at the submerged object than permitting a scuba diver to enter the water.By first light, several press people and scores of the general public were permitted to visit the site, as various attempts to locate the object were made and radiological surveys were performed. As the morning wore on, the news media people were clamouring for a conclusion to the drama as news story deadlines were rapidly approaching and the crowds which were estimated at between 1500 to 3000 people were becoming larger and larger. I later learned that perhaps as many as 10,000 people had jammed the roads leading into the city in an attempt to see what was going on. Chief Dottle even had neighbouring community police departments assist with the control of the increased traffic into the area. It looked just like a scene from a science fiction movie and fears grew that emergency vehicles could not have got through if they were needed. To make matters worse, although we hadn\'t a ghost of an idea of what was actually in the water, rumours were spreading like a brush-fire and a few very vocal UFO enthusiasts who were milling about at the site were questioning the effectiveness of the police, fire companies and UFO researchers\' retrieval efforts.Sgt Dottle began to fear that some minor incident involving the control of the crowds might spark a riot (or a panic) that his small police force couldn\'t possibly handle. Sgt Dottle found himself caught in the rather unenviable position of being damned if he did and damned, still, if he didn\'t do what everyone expected of him. He wanted to ensure the safety of the public, his men and the volunteers at the pond, while the media and the saucer buffs in the crowd were chomping at the bit for a quick and spectacular climax to the story. The pressure and anticipation were building with each passing hour, and while Mr Dains and I shared Chief Dottle\'s concerns about safety, we were also concerned that the mysterious object in the water be spared from loss or damage by our recovery efforts.Of course, not everyone was on the same page (i.e. thinking about safety and the preservation of evidence). I distinctly recall one persistent and annoying fellow asking me why we hadn\'t used more fire companies to do the pumping. When I replied that we didn\'t think it necessary (or prudent) to leave the surrounding communities without adequate fire protection, he grew visibly agitated and said ""Well, you should be digging for that damned flying saucer now that the water level is down a bit!"" Somehow, I knew that no matter how far we dug, if we still hadn\'t found anything, this guy would be saying, ""Just two more feet and a bit to the left!""In fact, Sgt Dottle had requested the use of a large crane fitted with a massive magnet (i.e., the type used at auto salvage yards) since the pumping operations which commenced a little before noon hadn\'t been very successful, and were taking far longer than anticipated to complete. Silt, mud and assorted bits of trash in the pond were clogging the pumping lines and we even had concerns that the huge magnet might crush whatever was in the water so we opted to use a backhoe to help lower the water level of the pond by digging a drainage ditch from it. This too, was time consuming and there were concerns that the pond might empty too quickly causing a deluge of polluted (and possibly radioactive) water to engulf the area. It seemed that we would have to send in a diver to take a quick look-see at the object.The diver, Mr Mark Stamey, age 26, was also a volunteer from New York State. He drove to the crash scene with a friend after hearing about the UFO incident on a car radio. He told me that he felt that all the publicity about his assistance with the sunken UFO would be a real boost for his fledgling diving business. Stamey also asked me to write him a note informing his state parole officer that I had requested he cross state lines to assist in the recovery operations.I told Stamey that I hadn\'t the authority to do that and suggested he speak to Mr Dains or Chief Dottle about his dilemma. I later observed Stamey preparing his diving equipment and assumed that the question of his parole status had been straightened out. So, after briefing him on the scant information we had gathered and conveying our concerns that the object might still be electrified and/or radioactive, the diver slipped into his wet suit and prepared to enter the silt pond.The UFO researchers were being interviewed by the press and a TV station\'s helicopter circled the pond churning up the water. Although we still hadn\'t any solid information on what the object in the water might be, Dr Hynek\'s representative and I were starting to suspect that the incident might be a prank that the teens had perpetrated on a nothing else to do Saturday night whim. We thought that perhaps their hoax simply got out of control and took on a life of its own - and that the boys may have been too scared to fess up to what they had done. Of course, it may have been that the boys had witnessed a meteor or a bolide (a large and occasionally exploding meteor) streaking across the night sky and mistakenly assumed that it was the same luminous object that they discovered moments later in the pond. This seemed to be a reasonable notion, as the boys\' description of the aerial phenomenon they had observed was absolutely meteoric in character. In fact, I had very similar reports on file at the UFO report and information centre, reports that were later verified by technicians at the Fels Planetarium. One report stated, ""About twenty stories overhead, a white fiery object with a red light on the underside about centre -flying east to west - it had sparks on the sides and coming from the rear section."" The sighting duration was 15 seconds. (Mr Sanford Epstein, Levittown, Pennsylvania, 14 June 1974 - 9:15 p.m. EST).Moreover, while attempting to discover who had perpetrated the hoax (if one had been committed?) was one of the field investigator\'s tasks, it was quite naturally, primarily a police matter as a great deal of the authority’s time and resources were expended during the 44 hour UFO drama. The UFO researchers’ interests and responsibilities were to identify the object (if possible) and to preserve any evidence found from damage or loss (if possible). They would also gather eyewitness testimony on the incident to be used in later evaluation and analysis of the matter and in determining the veracity of the witnesses. But in the Carbondale case, the researchers were also presented with the opportunity and distinct privilege of working with the community\'s authorities towards a safe and successful resolution of the incident. Unlike other ""downed UFO incidents"" where UFO investigators and civilian volunteers were reportedly turned away from the area by the military and police officials, such was definitely not the case at Carbondale.According to the boys, John Lloyd, 14, William Lloyd, 16, and Robert Gillette, 15, the object that they observed coursing through the evening sky was a relatively ill-defined flaming mass with a shower of sparks trailing it as it rapidly travelled on an east to west course. Report sketches provided by the Lloyd brothers show an oval object with the descriptive words ""red, yellow and white"" printed under the drawing.But an earlier drawing by Bobby Gillette looks something like a lens seen on its edge - Gillette\'s object also has a red dot in its centre. The teenage trio did not hear any sounds coming from the object as it descended, according to their first oral and written accounts - nor did the boys actually see it plummet into the pond. But one of the lads would later say that he saw cinders falling from it. My inspection of the alleged crash site revealed that there were no topographical indicators to suggest that something like a plane, a large piece of space junk or a meteor had impacted the pond or the area surrounding it.There wasn\'t any obvious displacement of earth; there was no displacement of water from the pond; there were no indicators of a fire, downed tree limbs or skid marks creating a gouge in the soil like the one which is said to have been evident at the J.B. Foster ranch near Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. Interestingly, the details of the Roswell UFO story were not very well known by the general public or the press corps at the time of the Carbondale incident, but the reported UFO crash at Kecksburg in the western part of Pennsylvania had occurred nine years earlier and had received some attention by the press.But Carbondale\'s UFO (as a structural configuration) was not observed on the ground or while it was in the water. No one knew if it was a disc, a sphere like Sputnik or a cylindrical craft of some kind. There was just the glowing 5 foot circle of light on the water which the boys said had sizzled or softy hissed for several seconds. Interestingly, while the police were poking around (in search of the submerged object) with a long pole that was fitted with a fish net, the disc of light suddenly charged their boat and one officer instinctively drew his revolver and fired at it!In the pandemonium of the harrowing moment, the officer lost his balance and fell out of the boat into the silt pond which was said to have had a bottom like quicksand! I was unable to confirm this story with police officials at Carbondale back in 1974, but a deputy sheriff from the neighbouring community of Honesdale, Pennsylvania later told Ohio MUFON\'s chief researcher, Mr Larry Moyers, that Officer Joseph Jacobina (or Jacobino) had fired six shots at the on-rushing light.Reportedly, patrolman Mark Trella (or Eltrilla) thought that he had snagged the object in the fish net at one point while in the boat,but it seemed to be quite heavy and slipped away. It was thought that the attempt had up-ended the object and the light was either facing down into the silt or else, it went out entirely. When the pole was retracted from the water, it was noticed that the fish net on the end of it was slightly torn. But, the effort was not completely in vain as it was also noted that the 5 foot in diameter disk of light on the water\'s surface appeared to emanate from a much smaller point of light at the bottom of the pond. In other words, the officers had observed an apparent cone-of-light in the water.When Mr Dains took water samples from the pond, I was surprised to see that the water was basically clear and one could see for about a depth of 3 to 4 feet into it. I observed a discarded auto tyre, bits of trash and a sunken vehicle\'s roof and hood areas. Of course, looking at the daylight reflecting off the water\'s surface made the water appear to be more opaque, and at certain angles the pond\'s silt floor appeared to give the water a brownish-grey cast. The water was indeed polluted, but it wasn\'t very discoloured. Naturally, when the pond\'s silt and muddy bottom were disturbed the water did become very cloudy and murky-looking. The pond was an abandoned coal cleaning breaker pit that had managed to fill up with rain water over the years. Mr Dains and I also walked around the pond with instruments to detect magnetic disturbances; none were noted.This cone-of-light seemed to be consistent with Sgt Dottle\'s early suspicions that the object was probably a flashlight. Moreover, Officer Trella\'s remarks that the object seemed to be too heavy to be a flashlight were based on the difficulty that he experienced while attempting to lift the object in the net on the end of a 10 foot long pole. In fact, he may have even been struggling with other debris, mud and silt on the pond\'s bottom at the time (?). Anyway, it seems that the light in the water was visible for a period of six to eight hours - depending upon one\'s acceptance of the boys\' reported discovery time or the initial observation of it by the Carbondale police. (i.e. from 7:00-9:00 p.m. on the night of 9 November to approximately 3:00-3:30 a.m. on the morning of the 10th).It is entirely possible that when officer Trella attempted to retrieve the object in the net and he thought it had slipped away, he may have caused the lantern to fall into another location on the bottom of the pond. Or he may have merely nudged the lantern which then resettled itself in the silt, thereby creating the illusion that it was rushing towards the boat. Additionally, any fisherman can tell you that lifting things on the end of a pole is strenuous, and that the object being lifted is perceived to be heavier and larger than it really is.', '1974 - Abduction at Medicine Bow National ParkThis very interesting case took place in Medicine Bow National Forest, Wyoming. On October 25, 1974, one Carl Higdon was elk hunting in the northern section of the park. As he shot his rifle at an elk nearby, a most bizarre thing happened. The bullet traveled in slow motion, as if he had entered another dimension. It fell some 50 feet away, dropping into the snow covered landscape. He was able to recover the bullet. He felt a strange sensation over his body.To his utter shock and amazement, he saw a humanoid entity standing nearby. The humanoid was quite tall, at over six feet in height. He was clad in a black jump suit with a wide belt. The belt was decorated with a six-pointed star and emblem of yellow. With straight hair standing out from his head, he had no eyebrows. He stood bow-legged, with long arms ending with rod-like appendages instead of hands.The humanoid spoke to Higdon, asking him if he was hungry. The entity threw some pills to him, telling him if he took one, he would not have to eat for 4 days. Higdon normally did not take any type of pills, yet he swallowed one of the offerings immediately. It was surmised that the entity was smart enough to realize that Higdon may have been hungry, or else he would not have been hunting elk.Soon, the alien pointed toward Higdon, and the next thing he knew, he was enclosed within a transparent apparatus, with a helmet on. Also present were two more humanoids, and the five elk he was previously stalking. The elk were in a frozen state. He was told that the aliens were traveling to their home planet, located some 163,000 light years away. In a flash, they arrived at the distant location.Higdon described the surrounding landscape as being occupied with buildings like the Seattle space needle, all lit up by a sun of intense power. The brightness of the atmosphere caused Higdon\'s eyes to water, along with the aliens\'. Higdon\'s next remembrance was being back in Medicine Bow Park. He says that approximately 2 1/2 hours had elapsed since his encounter with the humanoid had begun.He was in a hysterical state, cold, and disoriented. For a time, he could not locate his truck, finally finding it some three miles from where he had left it. It had been stuck in a mud hole, and Higdon was unable to free it from the bog by himself. Using his CB radio, he summoned help from the local sheriff, who arrived at midnight. Additional help arrived to free the stuck truck.Hidgon was found in a state of panic and nervous exhaustion. He was shouting, ""They took my elk!"" He was taken for medical care to a local hospital. His blood work showed he had a highly elevated level of vitamins, probably from the pill he had taken. The most fascinating aspect of his tests was that tuberculosis scars on his lungs were now gone!Further investigation into the details surrounding the bizarre encounter revealed that Higdon\'s wife, along with two other people, had seen a red-green-white flashing light moving in the area of the sighting. The case was investigated by Dr. Leo Sprinkle, Professor of Psychology, University of Wyoming. Also included were Rick Kenyon, and Robert Nantkes, MUFON field investigators, and Frank Bourke, National Star Investigator.(B J Booth)source and references:MUFONLeo SprinkleNational Star Investigator', 'From the UFO Casebook Archives...1974 Aug 25 - Coyame, Chihuahua, Mexico-Disk Crashes The radio interceptions were reported through channels to the CIA. Possibly as many as two additional government agencies also received reports, but such has not been confirmed as of this date. The CIA immediately began forming a recovery team. The speed with which this team and its equipment was assembled suggests that this was either a well-rehearsed exercise or one that had been performed prior to this event.In the meantime,  requests were initiated at the highest levels between the United States and Mexican governments that the US recovery team be allowed onto Mexican territory to ""assist."" These requests were met with professed ignorance and a flat refusal of any cooperation.By 21:00 hrs, 26 Aug 1974, the recovery team had assembled and been staged at Fort Bliss. Several helicopters were flown in from some unknown source and assembled in a secured area. These helicopters were painted a neutral sand color and bore no markings. Eye witness indicates that there were three smaller craft, very probably UHl Hueys from the description. There was also a larger helicopter, possibly a Sea Stallion. Personnel from this team remained with their craft and had no contact with other Ft. Bliss personnel.Satellite and aircraft overflight that day indicated that both the crashed disk and the civilian aircraft had been removed from the crash sites and loaded on flat bed trucks. Later flights confirmed that the convoy had departed the area heading south.At that point the CIA had to make a choice; either to allow this unknown aircraft to stay in the hands of the Mexican government, or to launch the recovery team, supplemented by any required military support, to take the craft. There occurred, however, an event that took the choice out of their hands. High altitude overflights indicated that the convoy had stopped before reaching any inhabited areas or major roads. Recon showed no activity, and radio contact between the Mexican recovery team and its headquarters had ceased. A low altitude, high speed overflight was ordered.The photos returned by that aircraft showed all trucks and jeeps stopped, some with open doors, and two human bodies laying on the ground beside two vehicles. The decision was immediately made to launch the recovery team,  but the actual launching was held up for the arrival of additional equipment and two additional personnel. It was not until 14:38 hrs that the helicopters departed Ft. Bliss.The four helicopters followed the border down towards Presidio then turned and entered Mexican airspace north of Candelaria. They were over the convoy site at 16:53 hrs. All convoy personnel were dead, most within the trucks. Some recovery team members, dressed in bioprotection suits, reconfigured the straps holding the object on the flatbed truck, then attached them to a cargo cable from the Sea Stallion. By 17:14 hrs the recovered object was on its way to US territory. Before leaving the convoy site, members of the recovery team gathered together the Mexican vehicles and bodies, then destroyed all with high explosives. This included the pieces of the civilian light plane which had been involved in the mid-air collision. At 17:46 hrs the Hueys departed.The Hueys caught up with the Sea Stallion as it reentered US airspace. The recovery team then proceeded to a point in the Davis Mountains, approximately twenty-five miles northeast of Valentine. There they landed and waited until 02:25 hrs the next morning. At that time they resumed the flight and rendezvoused with a small convoy on a road between Van Horn and Kent. The recovered disk was transferred to a truck large enough to handle it and capable of being sealed totally. Some of the personnel from the Huey\'s transferred to the convoy.All helicopters then returned to their original bases for decontamination procedures. The convoy continued non-stop, using back roads and smaller highways, and staying away from cities. The destination of the convoy reportedly was Altanta, Georgia.Here the hard evidence thins out. One unconfirmed report says the disk was eventually transferred to Wright-Patterson AF Base. Another says that the disk was either transferred after that to another unnamed base, or was taken directly to this unknown base directly from Atlanta.The best description of the disk was that it was sixteen feet, five inches in diameter, convex on both upper and lower surfaces to the same degree, possessing no visible doors or windows. The thickness was slightly less than five feet. The color was silver, much like polished steel. There were no visible lights nor any propulsion means. There were no markings. There were two areas of the rim that showed damage, one showing an irregular hole approximately twelve inches in diameter with indented material around it. The other damage was described as a ""dent"" about two feet wide. The weight of the object was estimated as approximately one thousand, five hundred pounds, based on the effect of the weight on the carrying helicopter and those who transferred it to the truck.There was no indication in the documentation available as to whether anything was visible in the ""hole.""It seems likely that the damage with the hole was caused by the collision with the civilian aircraft. That collision occurred while the object was traveling approximately 1700 knots (1,955 mph). Even ignoring the speed of the civilian aircraft, the impact would have been considerable at that speed. This is in agreement with the description of the civilian aircraft as being ""almost totally destroyed."" What was being taken from the crash site was pieces of the civilian aircraft.The second damage may have resulted when the object impacted with the ground. The speed in that case should have been considerably less than that of the first impact.No mention is made of the occupants of the civilian aircraft. It is not known if any body or bodies were recovered. Considering the destruction of the civilian light aircraft in mid-air, bodies may well not have come down near the larger pieces. Unfortunately what caused the deaths of the Mexican recovery team is not known. Speculation ranges from a chemical released from the disk as a result of the damage, to a microbiological agent. There are no indications of death or illness by any of the recovery team. It would not have been illogical for the recovery team to have taken one of the bodies back with them for analysis. But there is no indication of that having happened. Perhaps they did not have adequate means of transporting what might have been a biologically contaminated body.Inquires to the FAA reveal no documents concerning the civilian aircraft crash, probably because it did not involve a US aircraft.

As the airplane approached Bakersfield, California, the passengers called Paynter\'s attention to a strange object to their rear. ""It appeared to be several hundred yards away,"" Paynter recalled. ""It was a fairly steady light until it began to accelerate. Then it appeared to elongate. Then the light took off. It went up at a 45-degree angle-at a high rate of speed. Everyone on the plane was surprised. . . . The UFO went from a normal cruise speed to a fantastic speed instantly. If you give an airplane power, it will accelerate-but not like a hot rod, and that\'s what this was like.""A week later Reagan recounted the sighting to Norman C. Miller, then Washington bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal. Reagan told Miller, ""We followed it for several minutes. It was a bright white light. We followed it to Bakersfield, and all of a sudden to our utter amazement it went straight up into the heavens."" When Miller expressed some doubt, a ""look of horror came over [Reagan]. It suddenly dawned on him . . . that he was talking to a reporter."" Immediately afterward, according to Miller, Reagan ""clammed up.""Reagan did not discuss the event again, at least publicly.']"

I was brushing the swimming pool with a long pole and attached brush so that the kids could swim the following day. The pole requires you reach up to push down. I was standing on a high platform next to and overlooking the pool and about 4 feet over the rest of the pool area. As I reached to upper end of pole, I saw a craft approaching the house from about 1-2 blocks away and from the West and heading South East. I knew right away that it was not a helicopter or plane. It seemed flatter and wider and with lights in a circumference of the main frontal area. I ran towards the house and called my family to see it. Only my wife came out. By that time it was directly over our house and pool. It was approximately 75-100 feet above us. We stood along side of the pool deck. It made no sound whatsoever, and it was at a complete stopped over us for about 40 seconds. The only motion was a slight wobble and when it moved and tilted downwards at an angle. I took this as some form of acknowledgment. During the entire time, we were frozen in disbelief. It is a strange sensation knowing that what you are seeing is not supposed and very foreign. It was like seeing a Greyhound Bus floating over your house! The craft was about 75-100 feet in diameter. It had small porthole and lights around it in the upper dome section, it was solid, metallic and shiny. There was a dome in the upper section attached to the body with no visible separation, as if it were molded as one solid craft. The under section was concave towards the center and had two rectangular shapes along side each other and the length of the concave under-section. The rectangular shapes were about 7-10 feet in width and as along as the craft\'s concave underside center. I also noticed ski like devices on the front and on each side of the front leading edge window. What caught my attention was that the devices were not in the center or the ""center of gravity"" for the craft\'s length and design but very forward. The skis were S shaped with the top of the S facing forward but a design I could not replicate. Upon the craft leaning in a downward motion we could see a window or cockpit like glass that was situated in the underside, it was on the front lower edge of the round craft. The rectangular window was approximately 4 feet in height and possibly 12-15 feet in length. There was a glow of soft orange and blue lights from the inside but we could not see anyone or any controls. It remained at a forward and downward angle for about 10 seconds. We both had the sensation of being watched. As it was angled, I noticed that light was emanating from the upper section that was not facing the swimming pool lights. Thus, it seemed to generate light through skin of the craft as the lights that first attracted me faced forward and were much lower than the upper section of the craft. My wife and I did not say anything to each other during the experience but she kept saying ""oh my God"" over and over again. The craft then left slowly at 30-40 MPH. I jumped on a wall around our property to continue seeing for at least 7-miles. I instructed my wife not to discuss it, to draw what she saw and then we would compare drawings. They matched, although mine had more detail and accuracy. My background include Group Propulsion Systems and later as an executive with several major computer companies.

1969, ,"[""1969-Brazil; Abduction of José Antonio da SilvaThe following abduction occurred at Bebedouro, Minas Gerais, Brazil, in the afternoon of 4 May, 1969. 24-year-old José Antonio da Silva, an enlisted soldier, was fishing on a lagoon when suddenly he heard voices, became aware of figures moving behind him, and felt a burst of light strike his leg. He dropped his fishing rod and fell to his knees. Two beings, about four feet tall, wearing aluminumlike suits and what appeared to be helmets, seized him and dragged him to an object sitting on a dirt road. The object was shaped like an upright cylinder and had black platforms at each end. The soldier was taken inside, where the beings put one of their 'helmets' on him...Da Silva felt the craft rise. The beings talked animatedly among themselves in a language he did not recognize. After a long period of travel, he felt a jarring that suggested their craft had landed. The soldier was then blindfolded and led to a large room, where they removed the wrap from his eyes.A being stood in front of him who was extremely hairy and slightly taller than the rest. His waist-long hair was reddish and wavy.When the others took off their helmets, they were of similar appearance.Da Silva watched as the beings, at one point more than a dozen, examined his fishing equipment and took one of every item he had in duplicate. Later the witness noticed on a low shelf the bodies of four human men, one black, and became terribly frightened. Later still, the beings gave him a dark green liquid to drink out of a cubical stone glass.The dwarf leader then began a strange conservation with the soldier, mostly about weapons, which was conducted entirely with gestures and drawings. Da Silva also understood that they wanted him to help in their relations with humans. When the soldier refused, the dwarf snatched the crucifix from the rosary Da Silva always carried with him. As the soldier began praying, a Cristlike figure appeared to him, making revelations. Shortly afterwards, Da Silva was blindfolded again and taken back to earth. As the craft landed, he felt he was being dragged and lost consciousness. He woke up alone near the town of Vitoria, about 200 miles from where he had been fishing. He was dehydrated and hungry, but drank from a stream and was able to catch some fish as he still had his rod with him. Only his identity card, which the aliens had examined, had disappeared.

He dropped his fishing rod and fell to his knees. Two beings, about four feet tall, wearing aluminumlike suits and what appeared to be helmets, seized him and dragged him to an object sitting on a dirt road. The object was shaped like an upright cylinder and had black platforms at each end. The soldier was taken inside, where the beings put one of their 'helmets' on him...Da Silva felt the craft rise. The beings talked animatedly among themselves in a language he did not recognize. After a long period of travel, he felt a jarring that suggested their craft had landed. The soldier was then blindfolded and led to a large room, where they removed the wrap from his eyes.A being stood in front of him who was extremely hairy and slightly taller than the rest. His waist-long hair was reddish and wavy.When the others took off their helmets, they were of similar appearance.Da Silva watched as the beings, at one point more than a dozen, examined his fishing equipment and took one of every item he had in duplicate. Later the witness noticed on a low shelf the bodies of four human men, one black, and became terribly frightened. Later still, the beings gave him a dark green liquid to drink out of a cubical stone glass.The dwarf leader then began a strange conservation with the soldier, mostly about weapons, which was conducted entirely with gestures and drawings. Da Silva also understood that they wanted him to help in their relations with humans. When the soldier refused, the dwarf snatched the crucifix from the rosary Da Silva always carried with him. As the soldier began praying, a Cristlike figure appeared to him, making revelations. Shortly afterwards, Da Silva was blindfolded again and taken back to earth. As the craft landed, he felt he was being dragged and lost consciousness. He woke up alone near the town of Vitoria, about 200 miles from where he had been fishing. He was dehydrated and hungry, but drank from a stream and was able to catch some fish as he still had his rod with him. Only his identity card, which the aliens had examined, had disappeared. He had a swollen knee where the ray had struck him and three open wounds on his neck where the helmet had rubbed against his skin. He had been away four and a half days. One of the central questions in this case is how Da Silva travelled the 200 miles from Bebedouro to Vitoria, and where his physical body was during his 4.5-day absence.

The craft was seen by the entire crew of the Oil Tanker ""British Grenadier"" for exactly 3 days!The event occurred around April/May 1969 while the ""British Grenadier"" was sailing through the Gulf of Mexico. The UFO appeared directly above the ship at exactly noon on the first day. It just seemed to appear as nobody saw it arrive and it remained above the ship for the next 3 days. According to reports the craft was approximately 1 mile above the ship and dark blue in colour during the day. At night it appeared as a silvery light. The weather conditions were good at the time, with a clear sky and calm seas.On the first day of its arrival (one minute after midnight), the ships engines suddenly stopped and only emergency lighting and steering were available. The crew managed to restart the engines, which took some time as all the pumps had to be shut down and restarted manually.The second day saw all the food storage refridgerators closed down and no reason for this event could be found.On the third day at 11.45 pm one of the crew noticed that the lights were out in the ships air conditioning room and a door leading to the crews accomodation was opened. The engineer passed through the door to investigate and spoke to two firemen. But the next day the same door was found welded shut! Apparently, the door had been welded before the ship left dock (because of a fault), but the door was definitely open for the engineer to have walked through it.A few minutes after this event the engines stopped again, leaving just emergency lighting and steering (again one minute after midnight!). They were restarted once more, but later it was discovered that the starter motor for the emergency diesel generator had been dismantled. All the parts of the generator were neatly placed by the machine as if someone had examined it.At exactly noon on the third day the craft vanished in the same manner as it had appeared.Although all these events were recorded in the ships log, this is the first time (to our knowledge) that this event has been published. We would be interested in hearing from any of the crew that were aboard the BP Oil Tanker ""British Grenadier"" at this time, in order to obtain more information about this sighting.

I am not sure of the dates, but it is close, J. K. he worked for me, and I went to the mine (Midway Mining Co) I owned this fluorite, zinc and lead mine. It was about 1969 in the fall, J. K. and I went down to the mine to get some pump parts to build a new pump. It was about 8 AM. We loaded up some parts and went to the machine shop at Frances, KY. about 13 miles from the mine. The machinist, J. K and I worked on the pump until about 9 PM. We had some old parts so we returned them to the mine.  I had a shop there then.The mine covered about 2 acres. It was cleared off with some gravel in the lot: there were 2 buildings and a head frame and some mining equipment on the yard and a grassy field all around the mine. One tree behind us, when we pulled into the mine we saw what looked like this new barn in front of us. It looked like a new metal building.  J. K. and I talked about it. I pulled the truck up so we could see it better. We were within 80 ft. of it. It looked like a 80 ft. high 80 ft. long and 80 ft. wide. It was as plain as it could be that we were looking at a new building that had been put up.  The farmer that owned the land was Doey Binkley. He did not like me mining on his property as he did not own the mineral under his farm, the minerals had been sold to a Mr. Martin in 1907. Doey bought the farm after I was mining. My mining lease forbade me from mining under a existing house,  barn, etc,  so J. K. and I were talking that the next day I would talk to a lawyer and get this building tore down. We probably talked about the building for 10 to 20 minutes all the time we were just looking at the building in amazement at how fast they had put it up.Then we saw a light like a hand held light coming from the back to the side of the building. I said Doey is here and I will talk to him now. We got out of the truck, and walked to the front of the truck,  and the building just went away: no sound,  not anything: it just went away.It was clear; not very cold,  no fog,  no other lights,  no water. It was just like a building sitting on the grass and then it went away. According to the eye witnesses, what appeared to be a building, was really an unknown object with the ability to either disappear, or quickly fly away. Could it have gone into another dimension right before their eyes, or simply vanished?W. L. D.source and references:Eye witness report, W. L. D.', 'The Secret KGB UFO Files, The Russian Crash of 1969The details of a Russian Crash on or about 1969 are sketchy and somewhat suspect. This case comes from the so-called ""Secret KGB Files,"" which were reportedly smuggled out of the former Soviet Union.  Reportedly, $10,000 was paid for the information. The details of these secret files were first offered to the general public on 9-13-98 as part of a TNT special titled ""The Secret UFO Files of the KGB."" The show featured extraordinary film and still photographs of the UFO recovery, and also a portion of autopsy film on part of an alien body.The event itself, according to the files, occurred in the state of Sverdlovsky, which was formerly Yekatrinburg of the USSR. The crash story follows a familiar pattern normally associated with this type of report.  The fiery crash of an unknown object occurred in March 1969. The site was secured by the Russian military, and one dead alien was found in the wreckage. The remains of the craft and alien were brought to a secure location, and the alien body was autopsied. Both still and moving pictures were taken of the craft, its retrieval, and the alien autopsy. The autopsy shows only an alien torso and arm. From the size of the body parts, the alien would have been an extremely small being.The TNT special features Roger Moore, veteran actor and former James Bond, who discusses other UFO events, along with interviews with UFO experts, CIA agents, and other film. Probably the most notable footage is from MIG gun cameras of confrontations with UFOs. There have been only a few still frames of this footage in America, and I have not been able as of this writing, 11-01-2002, to obtain the videos. The show itself is mediocre, and its only redeeming quality is the presentation of the UFO crash story. Supposedly, the crash story was validated by secret KGB documents.The footage at the crash site does seem to be authentic at least on several points. The truck in the film is a circa 1950 model ZIS151, which has not been used by the military for quite some time, and the truck would have been difficult to find to stage a hoax with. Other elements of the film do not exhibit any obvious signs of a hoax, as to the movement of the soldiers, the timing of the film as to shadows, and the UFO itself.There are also several documents shown to verify the event itself, and an eyewitness to the event who swears that the recovery mission did occur. The footage of the autopsy film shows personnel without caps and gowns, which seemed odd to me at first, but after some research I found that this was commonplace for that era in Russia.The furnishings in the room are acceptable, and in Russia have probably not changed much today. Three men in their 20\'s and 30\'s are performing the procedure, and one woman is taking notes. The note taker is identified as KGB stenographer O. A. Pshonikina. The alien\'s torso and arm are lying together on the table as the autopsy is performed, and there are documents shown to support the autopsy.Although the USA-Russia relationship is much improved over a few years ago, it still lacks. Any information received is subject to translation, and often times there are problems with interpretation. It is sad there is not more cooperation between the two countries. The case of the 1969 retrieval and autopsy are difficult to assess. Until more information is uncovered, it will remain unsubstantiated.']"

ON SITE INVESTIGATION: July 9, 1973 - Ted & Ginger Phillips July 14, 1973 - Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Ted & Ginger Phillips July 28, 1973 - Ted & Ginger Phillips LOCATION OF OBSERVATION: 1/2 mile SE of Columbia-NE1/4, SE 1/4, sec. 17, R. 12W, T.48N, Boone County, Missouri SETTING: The witnesses live in a mobile home located outside the city limits of Columbia. The home is located at the end of a dead end lane about 1,000 feet N of State Road WW. The home is surrounded by scattered trees with the exception of the front yard, to the E. A house is located across the lane to the E and is occupied by an elderly lady who was asleep at the time of the observation. OTHERS CONTACTED REGARDING THIS EVENT: Mrs. A.P., Directory Assistance Operator, Columbia Mrs. L.M., Operator, Columbia Mrs. H.S., Federal Aviation Administration, Columbia The following information was gathered during three visits at the home of the James Richard’s family. Portions of the report are taken directly from the taped interviews. THE OBSERVATION: The event began as Vanea went into the kitchen ( located at N end of the mobile home ) to place a baby bottle in the refrigerator, which is located by the N window and that window was open at the time. Vanea heard a rather loud ( it could be heard over the record player in the living room ) thrashing sound in the direction of scattered trees some 80 feet N of the window. At this point she could see nothing in the dark, wooded area. As she listened at the window the sound seemed to be moving around a large tree . As the sound persisted she became rather frightened and called to her father to come to the window. Mr. Richard’s and Jamie were sitting in the living room. Richards stated that as it was late, he was tired and was slow going to the window. Vanea ran to the screened porch at the front of the home and locked the outside screen door and the front door. By this time Richards had reached the window and was looking from the left side of the window toward the N-NE. Vanea took up a position on the right side of the window and was looking toward the trees . As he watched, Mr. Richards noted two beams of light which were located at a point between a fence and the trees. The light beams would have been about 50 feet from the window. The beams were tapered, wide at the top, about four feet wide, tapering to about two feet at the ground. They were some five feet apart at the top. The beams were bright and silver-white in color. He could not see any form above or behind the beams.  Suddenly, the beams disappeared, faded out rapidly, and a bright oval form was seen just above the original position of the beams. Richards and Vanea estimated the glowing form to be twelve to fifteen feet in diameter and very near the ground. The object was described as extremely bright ( Richards had to turn his eyes away briefly ) and silver-white in color. The edges were fuzzy and no surface details were visible. The glow did not fade or brighten during the observation. The trees around the form, to the left and right, were quite visible in the glow. The area was “lit up bright as day.” No sound could be heard other than the thrashing noise in the trees and grass. No other forms were seen. They noted that the trees were moving back and forth as though blown by a strong wind. ( wind speed was 5 knots-no storms in area ) Tree A showed a different motion... it was described by Vanea as a “tugging” motion. It seemed that something was pulling that one tree toward the ground. Shortly after the form was visible the thrashing noise ceased. The tugging motion on tree A was still evident. Mr. Richards and Vanea heard a loud cracking sound and the tugging motion stopped.  It was his tree which was damaged...the following morning a large limb was found broken at a point 17 feet above the ground.  The area was very quiet now: Richards moved to the various windows around the trailer. It was at this time that he noticed his dogs lying very still between the trailer and a shed nearby to the W. He told me the dogs were normally barking during the night at the various night animals in the area. It seemed very strange to him that his dogs were not barking at all this noise and bright lights.(the dogs are large security animals and not easily frightened) Richards then went to the bedroom at the S end of the trailer to get his guns. He brought the guns to the kitchen, removed several shells from a cabinet, loaded the guns and placed them on a deep freeze by the N window. He joined Vanea at the window once again and noted that the object was still there in the same position. The light from the glowing form illuminated trees as far away as 100 feet. At this close position(about 50 feet) it was silver-white or aluminum in color, no other colors were visible. Mr. Richards said, It was real, real bright at the center, dull white at the edges, way beyond a normal light(such as an automobile headlight at the same distance) in brightness. Of the brightness vanea said, It was bright, but it didn’t hurt my eyes. After the form had remained in this same position for several minutes Richards decided to call for help. The object suddenly began to move away toward the N, passing below tree limbs through an open area some 20 feet wide. It moved parallel to the ground until it reached the edge of a field and then raised slightly and hovered some 200 feet away from the house. At this point it was not as bright and they could see it was silver-white at the center with a blue band of light and an orange glow extending around the outer edge. It was still low enough to be below a line of trees at the N edge of the field. When it was at this far point, Richards said, The color, it was something to behold, I’m telling you, it was, really. The object moved about 10 degrees to the W, stopped briefly and moved back to its original position over the field. The motion was smooth and slow. While the object was some distance away Richards dialed 113 for directory assistance. Mrs. A.P. took the call and later told me that Richards was very excited and seemed to be frightened as he described the event. He told her that he needed help and asked her to contact the police, the FBI, or anyone who could help him. After about one minute she told him she would contact an operator and have her call him back. As he talked with Mrs. P., the house lights dimmed twice. He hung up and returned to the window. While Richards and Vanea were watching the object, Mrs. P. contacted Mrs. L.M. and gave her the phone number. Mrs. M. immediately dialed the number, there was no busy signal, no ring-nothing-in her opinion, the Richards line was dead. She tried dialing the number five times, pausing after the third try to contact Mrs.P. to be sure she had the right number. She did. After the fifth try(she stated it would have taken perhaps three minutes to dial five times, waiting briefly after each dial and contacting Mr. P. she did not get through. During this time Richards was quite concerned as no one had called back, so he picked up the receiver to call out again. Over his end of the line he could hear no sound, no busy signal. He tried again and again, suddenly, as he recalls, Mrs. M. was on the line saying - Richards? and he answered-Jefferson City? Richards then told Mrs. M. what had been happening and that he was frightened for his children. Mrs. M. thought ( she could not be sure ) that she contacted the Richards home at about 0045. To her best recollection, he repeated his story over and over, pausing to ask Vane if it was still there and what it was doing. Both operators felt that Richards was sober and telling the truth. After what seemed to be several minutes(she couldn’t be sure of the time line) Mrs. M. contacted the Flight Service Station ( FAA ) at the Columbia Regional Airport. Mrs. H.S. was on duty at the time, Mrs. S. stated that Richards sounded sincere and sober. He seemed to be frightened as he described the event. After several minutes Mrs. S. told Richards that there had been another sighting on June 24th at Jefferson City. She then told him that she would contact the police for him and they hung up. The object was again moving toward the home and Richards became very frightened. Richards stated, It came back and we had it, I’ll tell you. we didn’t know what to do, we both got kinda scared. I said, what’s gonna happen? Something’s gonna happen here. This cold feeling came over me, I got speechless at this time. I just had this cold feeling when it came back that second time. I was just sure, like you almost feel that you were gonna get killed or something. Like death was at you, this was it. I didn’t know what to do, I just froze. I just knew this was it and no one would come, no policemen. I was scared to go out the door, I wouldn’t have gone outside, no way. The object moved through the trees to a point near in the trees near its original position 50 feet away from the window. It remained there for an undetermined period of time. It suddenly moved away, through the trees toward the field. It move with a smooth, slow motion, no sound. Richards noted that the trees did not move during the second close approach and there was no thrashing sound. As the object reached a point at the near edge of the field it raised slightly until it reached a point over the field some 200 feet away. it hovered and no motion could be seen. It was still below the tree line to the N. The orange and blue bands could be seen again, it was silver-white at the center. The glow seemed to shrink, even though it was getting smaller the orange and blue bands were visible until it just disappeared by growing smaller and smaller. It does not appear likely it was growing smaller because it was moving away into the distance as no motion could be seen and it would have hit the trees to the N had it flown away. After the glow had faded out the object was not seen again. At about 0145 the police arrived, one young officer walked to the area with Richards and looked around briefly. He told Richards that there were some tracks but they looked like they were made by rabbits. Richards told him to forget the whole thing and he returned to the trailer, followed by the officer. He told the officer if he thought they were rabbit tracks he should forget the whole thing. It is very possible the officer didn’t see the deep imprints. They did not see the broken limb at that time. Richards called the Flight Service Station after the object had disappeared and Mrs. S. stated that he seemed relieved that he could talk with someone about the event. THE SITE: July 9, 1973... my wife and I interviewed the witnesses and investigated the area on our way to Chicago. Allen Hynek had invited us for a visit and to meet jazz drummer Buddy Rich ( I being a drummer and had mentioned to Allen that Buddy was my favorite on the planet ) Buddy had a sighting and had contacted Allen a week earlier and was playing in Chicago for a week. I spent most of the time obtaining measurements and taking photographs of the site. The imprints and damage to trees is located in an area of scattered trees N of the trailer. A fence is located 25 feet from the window and the first imprint was found some 50.5 feet beyond the fence. This seemed to be a series of imprints rather than just one. The imprints at this point number 4, they were 0.5 feet by 0.4 feet with a depth of 0.2 to 0.3 feet. This first set of imprints are 9.5 feet from a large broken tree limb. This limb is 0.4 feet in diameter and was still attached to the tree trunk. It appeared to have been twisted and pulled toward the ground. The limb was broken at a point 16.5 feet above the ground. two smaller limbs, each 0.1 feet in diameter, located on the larger limb, were broken off.  A small limb 17.0 feet above the ground and extending from the tree trunk at the point of the break, shows signs of being rubbed. All the breaks are fresh. Leaves in the area above the path taken by the object to and from the field, but especially over the point where it had hovered are dying. There are signs of heating three limbs on tree B had leaves that are brown, these are 25 to 35 feet above the ground. To the North of the first imprints ( along the objects reported path ) we found a complex series of imprints. It is difficult to determine a pattern as the object moved through this area four times, coming in an going out. Bob Gassaway, a reporter for the Columbia Tribune, visited the area the day after the sighting. He told me that he tried to make a heel mark by one of the imprints and although he weighs over 300 pounds, he could force his heel to a depth of only 1/2 inch. As the imprints are generally 0.5 by 0.4 feet with a depth of 0.3 feet, we must assume a weight on each imprint much above 300 pounds ( rabbits? ). There were no marks in the field and no radiation could be detected. Plaster casts were taken and the imprints outlined with flour for photographs. When we arrived in Chicago I processed the film at the Northwestern University darkroom. We described the event with the photographs and Buddy and Allen both planned to go back with us, Allen made it but Buddy couldn’t get around a schedule. Buddy and I discussed cases many times after this. On July 14th we returned with J. Allen. The leaves were all quite dead & the limbs were barren over the area.

It moved parallel to the ground until it reached the edge of a field and then raised slightly and hovered some 200 feet away from the house. At this point it was not as bright and they could see it was silver-white at the center with a blue band of light and an orange glow extending around the outer edge. It was still low enough to be below a line of trees at the N edge of the field. When it was at this far point, Richards said, The color, it was something to behold, I’m telling you, it was, really. The object moved about 10 degrees to the W, stopped briefly and moved back to its original position over the field. The motion was smooth and slow. While the object was some distance away Richards dialed 113 for directory assistance. Mrs. A.P. took the call and later told me that Richards was very excited and seemed to be frightened as he described the event. He told her that he needed help and asked her to contact the police, the FBI, or anyone who could help him. After about one minute she told him she would contact an operator and have her call him back. As he talked with Mrs. P., the house lights dimmed twice. He hung up and returned to the window. While Richards and Vanea were watching the object, Mrs. P. contacted Mrs. L.M. and gave her the phone number. Mrs. M. immediately dialed the number, there was no busy signal, no ring-nothing-in her opinion, the Richards line was dead. She tried dialing the number five times, pausing after the third try to contact Mrs.P. to be sure she had the right number. She did. After the fifth try(she stated it would have taken perhaps three minutes to dial five times, waiting briefly after each dial and contacting Mr. P. she did not get through. During this time Richards was quite concerned as no one had called back, so he picked up the receiver to call out again. Over his end of the line he could hear no sound, no busy signal. He tried again and again, suddenly, as he recalls, Mrs. M. was on the line saying - Richards? and he answered-Jefferson City? Richards then told Mrs. M. what had been happening and that he was frightened for his children. Mrs. M. thought ( she could not be sure ) that she contacted the Richards home at about 0045. To her best recollection, he repeated his story over and over, pausing to ask Vane if it was still there and what it was doing. Both operators felt that Richards was sober and telling the truth. After what seemed to be several minutes(she couldn’t be sure of the time line) Mrs. M. contacted the Flight Service Station ( FAA ) at the Columbia Regional Airport. Mrs. H.S. was on duty at the time, Mrs. S. stated that Richards sounded sincere and sober. He seemed to be frightened as he described the event. After several minutes Mrs. S. told Richards that there had been another sighting on June 24th at Jefferson City. She then told him that she would contact the police for him and they hung up. The object was again moving toward the home and Richards became very frightened. Richards stated, It came back and we had it, I’ll tell you. we didn’t know what to do, we both got kinda scared. I said, what’s gonna happen? Something’s gonna happen here. This cold feeling came over me, I got speechless at this time. I just had this cold feeling when it came back that second time. I was just sure, like you almost feel that you were gonna get killed or something. Like death was at you, this was it. I didn’t know what to do, I just froze. I just knew this was it and no one would come, no policemen. I was scared to go out the door, I wouldn’t have gone outside, no way. The object moved through the trees to a point near in the trees near its original position 50 feet away from the window. It remained there for an undetermined period of time. It suddenly moved away, through the trees toward the field. It move with a smooth, slow motion, no sound. Richards noted that the trees did not move during the second close approach and there was no thrashing sound. As the object reached a point at the near edge of the field it raised slightly until it reached a point over the field some 200 feet away. it hovered and no motion could be seen. It was still below the tree line to the N. The orange and blue bands could be seen again, it was silver-white at the center. The glow seemed to shrink, even though it was getting smaller the orange and blue bands were visible until it just disappeared by growing smaller and smaller. It does not appear likely it was growing smaller because it was moving away into the distance as no motion could be seen and it would have hit the trees to the N had it flown away. After the glow had faded out the object was not seen again. At about 0145 the police arrived, one young officer walked to the area with Richards and looked around briefly. He told Richards that there were some tracks but they looked like they were made by rabbits. Richards told him to forget the whole thing and he returned to the trailer, followed by the officer. He told the officer if he thought they were rabbit tracks he should forget the whole thing. It is very possible the officer didn’t see the deep imprints. They did not see the broken limb at that time. Richards called the Flight Service Station after the object had disappeared and Mrs. S. stated that he seemed relieved that he could talk with someone about the event. THE SITE: July 9, 1973... my wife and I interviewed the witnesses and investigated the area on our way to Chicago. Allen Hynek had invited us for a visit and to meet jazz drummer Buddy Rich ( I being a drummer and had mentioned to Allen that Buddy was my favorite on the planet ) Buddy had a sighting and had contacted Allen a week earlier and was playing in Chicago for a week. I spent most of the time obtaining measurements and taking photographs of the site. The imprints and damage to trees is located in an area of scattered trees N of the trailer. A fence is located 25 feet from the window and the first imprint was found some 50.5 feet beyond the fence. This seemed to be a series of imprints rather than just one. The imprints at this point number 4, they were 0.5 feet by 0.4 feet with a depth of 0.2 to 0.3 feet. This first set of imprints are 9.5 feet from a large broken tree limb. This limb is 0.4 feet in diameter and was still attached to the tree trunk. It appeared to have been twisted and pulled toward the ground. The limb was broken at a point 16.5 feet above the ground. two smaller limbs, each 0.1 feet in diameter, located on the larger limb, were broken off.  A small limb 17.0 feet above the ground and extending from the tree trunk at the point of the break, shows signs of being rubbed. All the breaks are fresh. Leaves in the area above the path taken by the object to and from the field, but especially over the point where it had hovered are dying. There are signs of heating three limbs on tree B had leaves that are brown, these are 25 to 35 feet above the ground. To the North of the first imprints ( along the objects reported path ) we found a complex series of imprints. It is difficult to determine a pattern as the object moved through this area four times, coming in an going out. Bob Gassaway, a reporter for the Columbia Tribune, visited the area the day after the sighting. He told me that he tried to make a heel mark by one of the imprints and although he weighs over 300 pounds, he could force his heel to a depth of only 1/2 inch. As the imprints are generally 0.5 by 0.4 feet with a depth of 0.3 feet, we must assume a weight on each imprint much above 300 pounds ( rabbits? ). There were no marks in the field and no radiation could be detected. Plaster casts were taken and the imprints outlined with flour for photographs. When we arrived in Chicago I processed the film at the Northwestern University darkroom. We described the event with the photographs and Buddy and Allen both planned to go back with us, Allen made it but Buddy couldn’t get around a schedule. Buddy and I discussed cases many times after this. On July 14th we returned with J. Allen. The leaves were all quite dead & the limbs were barren over the area.

Christa was kind enough to take the time to contribute her own fascinating experiences to this work and answer several of my questions so that other abductees, like herself, might better understand their own confusing encounters with alien abductors or even underground facilities: ""Several months ago I became aware of two different cases, one in May of 1973 in which a Judy Doraty of Texas had an unusual experience in which she may have been taken to an underground facility; also an abduction case investigated by APRO and a Mr. Paul Bennewitz in which in May of 1980 a Myrna Hansen of New Mexico had a similar experience in which she was taken to some type of underground facility. ""Since I am doing the investigation into my own underground experience, I found that to be of help to me or anyone else that might have experienced anything similar, I was going to have to make myself read their transcripts. For months I would procrastinate because I suppose, subconsciously, I did not really want to relive this experience I had -- by reading about another persons\' experiences. Now I am glad I did. I finally am going to reveal some of the many correlation\'s of all three of our cases in hopes that others will come forward with more information. ""My experience happened in July of 1987. I had about a three hour \'missing time\' in which later, under hypnosis, I relived the most unusual night of my life... I did not go willingly to the craft. Two small aliens dragged me by my two arms on my back to the craft after they rendered me unconscious. The next thing I remember is waking up on a table inside some type of small craft. A \'guide\' greeted me and gave me something to drink. I now believe it was a stimulant of some kind because I was not sleepy after I drank the substance. I was taken out of the craft and when I looked around I noticed I was standing on top of a hill. It was dark, but I saw a faint light near a cavern. We walked up to this area and it is then that I saw a man, dressed in a red military-type jump suit [like a pilot would wear]. My guide seemed to know this man as he greeted him as we came closer. I also noticed he wore some type of patch and was carrying an automatic weapon. When we walked into the tunnel, I realized we were going right into the side of a large hill or mountain. There we were met with another guard in red and I then saw a computerized check-point with two cameras on each side. To my left was a large groove where a small transit vehicle carried you further inside. To my right it looked like a long hallway where there were many offices. We took the transit car and went for what seemed to be a very long time to another secured area. It was then that I was told to step onto some type of scale-like device that faced a computer screen. I saw lights flashing and numbers computing and then a card was issued with holes punched into it. I would later realize it was used as identification inside a computer. I asked my guide where we were going and why. He didn\'t say too much the whole time except that he was to show me some things that I need to know for future reference. He told me that we had just entered Level One of the \'facility\'. I asked what kind of facility it was and he did not answer. ""This story is so very long and detailed and I hope to write more about it so I will [only] highlight some of the things that I saw... I was taken to a huge looking elevator that had no door. It was like a very large dumb-waiter. It took us down to Level Two where there were two guards in a different color jumpsuit and I had to go down a large hall and saw many offices that had computers that lined the wall. As we walked by, I noticed the lighting was strange in that I could not see a source for it. Other people walked by and never once acted like I was a stranger. I felt I was in a huge office building where there are many employees with many offices and cubicles. I then saw an extremely large area which looked like a giant factory. There were small alien-type craft parked at the sides. Some were being worked on underneath and it was then that I saw my first grey-type alien. They seemed to be doing the menial jobs and never once did they look up as we passed. There were cameras posted every where. ""Then we arrived at another elevator and went down to Level Five. It was then that I felt a sense of extreme fear and balked. My guide explained that as long as I was with him that I would not be harmed. So we got off and I saw guards posted there at the checkpoint. This time they were not friendly and were issuing orders right and left. I noticed that two of the guards seemed to be arguing about something and they kept looking over at me. I wanted to find the closest exit out of this place, but I know I had come too far for that. This time I was asked to change clothes. I was told to put on what looked to me like a hospital gown, only thank God there was a back to it! I did as I was told because I didn\'t want to cause any trouble. I stepped onto this scale-like device and suddenly the screen lighted up and I heard strange tones and frequencies that made my ears hurt. What I really thought was strange is that these guards saluted the guide I was with although he was not wearing any military clothes. He was dressed in a dark green jumpsuit, but it had no insignia that I know of. He told me to follow him down this corridor. As I passed the guard station, I noticed the humming of those cameras as they watched my every move. I was taken down another hall and it was then that I smelled this horrid smell. Contrary to Judy and Myrna\'s stories, I knew what I was smelling or at least I thought I knew. It smelled like formaldehyde. Because of my medical background I felt probably more comfortable with this situation because I had gone through it so many times before. ""We came to a large room and I stopped to look inside. I saw these huge large tanks with computerized gauges hooked to them and a huge arm-like device that extended from the top of some tubing down into the tanks. The tanks were about 4 feet tall so standing where I was I could not see inside them. I did notice a humming sound and it looked as if something was being stirred inside the tanks. I started to walk closer to the tanks and it was at that time that my guide grabbed my arm and pulled me roughly out into the hall. He told me that it wasn\'t necessary to see the contents of the tanks; that it would only complicate matters. So we went on down the hallway and then he guided my arm into a large laboratory. ""I was amazed because I had worked in [a laboratory] before and I was seeing machines that I had never seen before. It was then I turned and saw a small grey being with his back turned doing something at a counter. I heard the clinking of metal against metal. I had only heard this when I was preparing my surgical instruments for my doctor in surgery. Then my guide asked me to go and sit down on the table in the middle of the room. I told him that I wouldn\'t do it and he said it would be much easier if I would comply. He was not smiling and I was scared. I did not want to be left in this room with this grey alien! ""About the time I was thinking this a human man entered. He was dressed like a doctor, with a white lab coat on and the same type of badge I was issued. My guide went to greet him and they shook hands. I began shaking and I was cold. The temperature seemed awfully cold. My guide smiled at me and told me he would be waiting outside and I would only be there for a few minutes. I began to cry. I cry when I get scared. The grey alien looked at me and turned around to continue what he was doing. The doctor called for more assistance and it was then that one other grey alien came in. The next thing I knew I was very drowsy. I knew I was being examined internally and when I lifted my head, I saw this horrid grey alien glaring at me with large black eyes. It was then I felt a stabbing pain. I screamed and then the human doctor stood next to me and rubbed something over my stomach. It was cold. The pain immediately subsided. I could not believe this was happening to me all over again. I begged for them to let me go, but they just kept on working very fast. After they were finished, I was told to get up and go into this small room and change back into my other clothes. I noticed blood, as if I had started my period. But, I continued to get dressed and when I came out I saw my guide speaking to the doctor in the corner of the room. I just stood there... helpless. I felt more alone then than I ever had in my life. I felt like a guinea pig. After we left that laboratory I was silent. I was angry at him for allowing this to happen to me \'again\'. But he said it was necessary. Told me to forget. ""I see more aliens pass us in the hall. Again, it is as if I was a ghost. I asked my guide to please explain this place to me. He told me it was a very sensitive place and I would be brought back again in the next few years. I again asked where I was and he told me I could not be told for my own safety. We then got into the small transit car and it took us to the other side. It was there that I saw the most disturbing things of all. Unlike the other two women (Myrna Hansen of New Mexico who was abducted to the Dulce base in May of 1980, and Judy Doraty of Texas who had a similar experience in May of 1973 that was investigated by APRO and Paul Bennewitz - Branton) who saw cows being mutilated, I saw what looked to me to be people of all different types standing up against the wall inside a clear casing-like chamber. I went closer and it looked \'as if\' they were wax figures. I could not understand what I was seeing. I also saw animals in cages. They were alive..."" At this point the \'guide\' escorted Christa to the elevator and up through the various levels, following which the transit car took her to the waiting alien craft, at which point she was returned to her home some three hours after her abduction experience had begun. Incidentally, Christa claims to have also experienced contacts with human-like beings from other worlds. One alien by the name of \'Maijan\' who has dealt with Christa all her life has always worn an emblem of a feathered serpent, possibly symbolic of the ancient Mayan deity Quetzalcoatl. He also claims to have ancestors from the Aztec and Mayan race, as do several of the \'Telosians\' inhabiting the colony under Mt. Shasta, California. Christa Tilton admits that of the human-like Pleiadeans and Lyrans she has encountered [aside from her encounters with short and tall Greys] range from the strict non-interventionists to the imperialistic factions who believe that conquering planet earth is justified as a means to subdue their perceived enemies on or below the surface of this planet. This might imply that the \'Draconians\' have, as many sources claim, maintained underground command centers beneath the surface of planet earth -- from where they direct many of their interventionist interstellar activities. In addition to the above, Christa Tilton was kind enough to answer some questions for this present volume in regards to her own experiences. These questions and answers follow: INTRODUCTION BY CHRISTA: I\'ve been investigating underground bases and Dulce -- actually underground bases all over the world -- since 1987... I\'ve had some good experiences and I\'ve had some bad experiences [with aliens, etc.] QUESTION: Have you seen any people who were being held captive underground, during your abductions to Dulce and other bases? ANSWER: First of all let me state [that] there is more evidence NOW to prove that a base DID indeed exist back in 1987 when I was abducted (About 8 years following the Dulce wars, after which joint-interaction ceased for a period of two years - Branton), and it was in the process of being dismantled. A lot of times the government will have underground bases for different purposes, and then will shut them down, board them up, concrete them in or whatever, and go on and built another base somewhere else. What I will tell you is this. Let me stick with the question. You asked me did I see any people being held captive during that abduction to Dulce? I remember seeing some individuals as I was walking by. They looked as if they were in suspended animation. I went up to the clear casings that they were being held in. I put my hands on the casing and leaned towards them to see if I could get some kind of a response. I did not. I could not discern whether they were dead or alive at that point in time. They were just not moving, and I could not see whether or not there was any fluid. I think that the casings were free of any fluid in this particular case. As far as my being taken to any other bases right now, I\'m not going to comment on that because I\'m still researching that. There has been speculation by, and information from, an Air Force officer at KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE that I along with some other women and men have been, more than likely, abducted and taken to the underground research facility near Kirtland AFB. It\'s in the Manzano mountain range south of KIRTLAND AFB where the nuclear testing was going on at that time. (NOTE: KIRTLAND AFB is the base where the \'division\' within the Intelligence Community over the Dulce facility and related joint-interaction projects seems to have begun, one that initially involved Col. Doty, Col. Edwards, the Wing Commander and others, a division between the anti-Grey U.S. Navy factions in the CABAL/COM-12 -- backed by the \'Electorate\' government; and their opposition, the pro-Grey NSA factions in AQUARIUS/MAJI -- backed by the \'Corporate\' government. - Branton) Q: Did any of your alien or human contacts mention the Dulce Wars? A: No. The alien beings that I came in contact with while underground did not speak to me. The human contacts did but no, they did not mention any kind of wars going on there. So at that particular time I was not aware of any kind of a power-struggle going on. I was just taken there for a specific purpose I think, and once that was done I was rushed out of there and I don\'t think any kind of knowledge like that in particular would have been given to me, there wouldn\'t have been any reason to give it to me. Q: What kinds of reptilians, if any, have you encountered. A: I am almost virtually positive that... I don\'t believe I have come across any reptilian aliens at all. The only types that I\'ve been associated with most of my life have been small grey aliens, the ones that I call workers. These are beings that I believe are soulless beings that are workers FOR an established alien race. They are given certain chores, certain jobs, just like we would if we worked for a large company...There are some taller Grey alien beings that I have encountered. Even though their eyes are large and dark, they don\'t have that \'reptilian\' look. I know. I know what you\'re talking about and no, I really haven\'t encountered any of those. (Of course from many other accounts, most of the \'Greys\' are reptilian BASED clones which have assimilated other genetics from insectoid or even plant-like life-forms. Outwardly they -- the clones especially -- do not normally appearance obviously \'reptilian\', which is likely the reason why they are most commonly used to \'interface\' with planetary intelligence agencies. The ""established alien race"" that the Greys are working for, according to many sources, are the taller more \'reptiloid\' appearing species including the ""white draco"" -- resident within levels six and seven, levels which Christa does not recall entering. - Branton) Q: Do you know of any other bases that researchers may be unaware of? A: That\'s a great question, really, because right now I\'m working with two individuals from Great Britain. They\'re two wonderful researchers who have been associated with Timothy Good. I don\'t know if you\'ve read his material, ""ABOVE TOP SECRET"". It\'s a wonderful book to get and read. Also ""ALIEN LIAISON"" is another one. But yes, I am aware of many, many, many underground facilities or bases that are being used for different purposes. Most of the underground bases are being used for covert purposes or otherwise purposes involving govenment\'s who are doing certain types of testing that they consider would be safer to do underground. And then there are the bases, one in particular north of Tucson, Arizona, where I\'m almost positive I was taken to, it goes under the cover or name of ""Evergreen Aviation"". They have all the planes there and everything, but what I found during my ten years of research is that this is a CIA-backed or based facility. I got very, very close to the facility, I climbed over the wired fence and sneaked in with a pilot friend of mine not long ago and got some great photographs of some black helicopters. These black helicopters were unmarked. There were other types of aircraft there, and so we really believe that there are many many bases in many states. I\'ve heard of bases in almost every state here in the United States. Now the two individuals that I\'m doing work for or research with in Great Britain especially are researching underground bases in America and in Great Britain. I guess they contacted me because they felt like there was a tie-in or some kind of connection, and that it would be a good thing to work together and share information and see what types of facilities we can find out about. In a lot of the facilities they are doing medical testing, some are actual laboratories like Los Alamos laboratories.They do massive amounts of covert work for Black Projects of our own government, so we\'re talking about installations, underground and above ground, that are doing things that we probably have no idea about. We hear rumors of course of different things that are going on. What I would venture to guess is that more than likely these rumors have been proven about 90% of the time to be true. Q: My belief is that the Greys operate from base animal or predatory instincts in their agendas to increase their power-base and exploit other cultures, and that they will continue to do so as a collective until they are stopped by force. Some of the Greys I believe might be \'tamed\' by humans so to speak, and attain a degree of emotional individuality IF they can be severed from the collective HIVE mind. What are your views on this? A: I agree with you on most of that... Certainly the Greys seem to do things like a massive collective consciousness. I\'ve noticed that they do things together, there is almost no discussion among themselves. They seem to be working on projects or on certain things that are given to them by higher-ups, or higher alien beings and/or humans. I really couldn\'t tell you. I have my doubts that humans would be able to \'tame\' any kind of alien intelligence here on earth. If indeed it looks like humans are working among the Greys together, that more than likely it was because of a pact or some type of a government agreement... I believe these aliens have come here for reasons, and certain individuals in the government have been given orders by their higher-ups to either give them opportunities to work alongside of these [aliens] for maybe a one-world purpose. Unless it could be shown to me to be true that the humans tamed these Greys that were working along-side with me, or on me, that would be very difficult for me to believe. Q: Have you had encounters with any Nazi-type aliens like those described by Barney Hill, Alex Christopher, Vladimir Terziski and others, alien \'fascists\' who date back to the secret Nazi flying disk experiments and who are allegedly working with the Greys and Reptiloids? A: I\'ve hard of these Nazi aliens. Of course where I first heard about them was from TAL LeVesque back in 1987. No I have never come in contact with what I would call Nazi type aliens although since most of my experiences have involved medical experimentation, genetic experimentation on me and my daughter or family, I would have to say that it reeks almost of... If you think about the medical experiments that were done on the Jews during the Holocaust, that is what I equate some of the experiments that happened to me with. It\'s strange because I\'m part German, I come from a family that originally came FROM Germany, so I do have some German blood in me, but I\'m not leaning one way or the other and as far as being a BIGOT is concerned, I\'m very very open to all races, creeds, colors of people working together to establish a wonderful world, if that would be possible. But anyway, no I have not encountered these Nazi types, and I\'ve certainly heard a lot about them, I\'ve heard they are very mean-spirited aliens, I don\'t know what their agenda is... Since I\'ve not had contacts with these types I really have no reason to do any research on them, and also the same goes for the [tall] reptilians, although many many friends and other researchers have contacted me telling their tales about reptilian alien races... Q: What are your views of a possible CONGRESSIONALLY backed take-over of the Dulce base in the future, and what would be your views on dealing with the problem supposing the Greys don\'t surrender? A: Through all of the research that I\'ve done, and all of the proof that I\'ve come up with the many times that I\'ve been up there poking around with researchers and other individuals, we\'re almost positive now -- I don\'t know if you\'ve even heard, you may have heard the rumor, or thought it was a rumor -- but I am of the belief system now that this base is or was deserted and is no longer being used by OUR government. For what reason I\'m not sure. I believe a lot of it had to do with -- if there was indeed a military action there, which we have found proof of. We found some spent military cartridge shells up near where we think one of the base openings is. We found C-Ration cans, we found different types of antennas that the government would have used for communications. These are things that have been found up in these mountainous areas. If you\'ve ever been there you\'ll know what I\'m talking about. These things tell me and my research partner that indeed there was some type of a military response there in the past. The areas I speak about, that my research partner who lives in the area claims were some of the openings to the base, have been concreted, cemented up. Now that\'s been done by somebody. So we know that some type of government official company... we believe it was a CIA-backed organization that was there... In my Dulce papers I show an area of a ranch just north of the Archuleta mesa area (Refer to Christa\'s research papers on Dulce at the address given at the end of this section for current discoveries in regards to Dulce and several provocative illustrations, diagrams and photographs of the same - Branton), we\'ve been unable to track or find the individuals who have owned this property now for many years. What we\'ve been told by the individuals who lived in or around the area, is that there is a landing strip on that particular property, there are large towers... I did get onto the property, and close up enough to get pictures of these bullet-proof towers that were sitting on the property. There WERE about 20, and there are only 5 there now. We\'re wondering why they were taken out, and where were they taken? Anyway I\'ve got pictures of those. These are not just fire towers. Some people try to explain them away by saying ""Oh, those are just so our ranchers could go up into the towers and look for fires,"" and things like that. The strange part about this is that you walk up the towers and there is dark black glass... you can\'t look in to see, and it\'s bullet proof. And what\'s strange is the opening... you are unable to get into these towers. We don\'t know if they were just put there for show, we don\'t really know exactly what they are, but we believe they were placed there for some reason. We have no understanding of that. There have been sightings of planes, small Lear jets landing in and out of that area over the years. Nobody in the town of Dulce seems to know who owns that property... My research partner did track down someone who did own the property over 20 years ago, but after that it seemed to go into covert hands. The property also had what looked like a small wooden house. You could just walk in there, it\'s been evacuated and there\'s nothing in there. This type of facility or front for an underground base in that area would be perfect, because this area was cordoned off by what we believe at one time was an electrified fence which they said was used to keep the cattle out. We believe that it was used for another purpose because of the signs posted all over -- NO TRESPASSING, and these were the types of signs that you would see up near AREA-51, and so we have to wonder what was going on upon that property. I don\'t know if you\'ve ever seen the movie ""THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN"", I saw it the other day, just haven\'t seen it in a long time. The underground facility that they went to [in the movie] was stationed on kind of a muck-up farm, where they went into the farm house and went into something like a tool shed, and then all of a sudden this elevator starts going down and down and down. And what they found once they went down was a massive underground biological testing facility. I have to believe that these types of facilities are all over in every state. So then, back to the question. If there was a military takeover it already happened, and the base was closed... Again there\'s no proof there. Some of the Indians who live on Jicarilla Apache land, these people are very very closed, they don\'t talk to outsiders. The information that I got was only from an inside source, and I can only tell you what one Jicarilla Apache Indian told his dear friend of many years there. He said that he was going up through the mountainous areas there, up through the Archuleta mesa and back into the hills, and was walking along-side of a ledge. All of a sudden he felt some dirt falling on his head. And so of course, if you were walking around in this deserted area and you felt something fall on your head, you\'re immediate response would be to look up. And he did, he looked up and he said what he saw horrified him. This is a man, he\'s a man in his 60\'s. This man looked up and saw... this is what he told his friend, ""I saw a grey being with large black inky eyes staring down at me over a ledge, and it looked like a large rock had been swiveled out, was sticking out of the side of the mountain."" And he did a double-take, he looked away like someone who would rub their eyes and say, ""Oh, I\'m just seeing things,"" but then he looked back up and he saw it again. Well this time he said he took off and he ran, he was running for his life. He was very, very frightened, scared, and what\'s strange is that this man is friends of the men high-up in the Jicarilla Apache tribal council, but he has kept this secret from everyone except my research partner. And he told him that when he got back he was shaking, he was very, very frightened. So THIS tells me -- and this just happened during the past couple years (this interview took place in the winter of 1996 - Branton), so this tells me that THERE ARE STILL GREY ALIENS inhabiting some part of that base. Interesting question there that you had because if indeed there is still part of the base that\'s still inhabited (why would the Greys only use \'part\' of the base after it had become even more secure, with the \'sealing\' of many of the outer entrances? - Branton) by the Grey beings, then certainly if there is a problem there might NEED to be a Congressional-backed military take-over of that base, or they may have just left it alone, just said ""let the people of Dulce worry about the aliens, we don\'t want to deal with them any more."" I don\'t really know what happened during the military events that they had there, I don\'t really know what happened, I just know that... I\'m almost POSITIVE that there was some type of a confrontation! So any way, who knows, who can say for sure? All I know is that a lot of these individuals that come up with different stories, these are individuals who are not the type of people to just come across with a tale, in fact [many of them] are not interested in UFO\'s, they\'re not interested in any of this. In fact when the subject is brought up they really just don\'t want to talk about it to you. It\'s very hard to get access into that community. I have had a lot of problems getting answers, but thank God one of my research partners, his father lives there, he\'s lived there all his life. And this young man was brought up there [Dulce]. He knows what happens there, he knows what all the rumors and tales are, and he knows what all the Indians have seen. Q: Have you been taken to any other planets or spheres during your abductions? A: Not that I know of, however I [remember] that I was taken to some type of large massive ship, it had to have been a mother ship. This thing was massive, it was miles and miles and miles long. I\'m not sure exactly where I was. I recieved some instructions while I was there. There were ""light beings"" there. They looked like angelic beings, only without the wings. They were wearing long robes, and I was taken into an area where they had a podium and a teacher that came out and was teaching the people who were there. These people were human, I did not see any aliens [greys] at THAT time, so I\'m not sure exactly where I was. Q: Did you ever get to see what was inside the \'tanks\'? A: No, not during the Dulce experience. I started to walk up to the tank. It smelled very foul. It was an odor that only I can identify as being close to a sulfuric type of odor. I remember when I first went in to the medical field we were invited downtown to view an autopsy, and the formaldehyde they use there has a sickening sweet smell, its a smell that is very difficult to try and explain to somebody who has not smelled it before, but I can say that it smelled a lot like that. The officer, the military man that was with me, guiding me, would NOT allow me up to the tank to look inside. I can only speculate that there was something in there that may have been frightening to me, because he reacted very quickly to stop me. You asked if there were both breeding and feeding tanks. I believe so, because from what I\'ve been told by some of the other women who saw these tanks, some of them saw body parts inside. The type of tanks that I saw were used for breeding and cultivation of small alien beings. The only thing that I can describe it as is of being [like] a fake womb. A woman carries her child in her uterus, well these types of breeding tanks that you\'re talking about were used to cultivate the fetus\' that they extract from the individuals that they abduct and take there. They extract the fetus like they have done with me MANY times, and I believe they place it in this type of a tank, a glass [looking] breeding tank. Q: What do you think most of the hybrids feel about the position they are in? (Note: I intended the question to mean the humanoid fetus\' who have been infused with non-human, cattle, cetacean or Grey, etc. DNA and who are kept in the underground bases or on ships. However Christa took the question to mean the TERRAN-NORDIC alien hybrids like herself and her daughter who were living in OUR surface-world society. - Branton) A: That\'s such a very good question and not many people ask that... I myself being a hybrid have felt that I do not fit in anywhere. I still feel like I don\'t ""fit in"" to this day. I know I don\'t, I know I\'m different, and I don\'t try to tell everybody that either. I just have accepted it and go on with my life, but I can assure you that every hybrid I\'ve spoken to has told me, has tried to explain to me the emptiness and the feelings that they feel. They feel almost like they don\'t belong here on earth. I certainly feel [that] I don\'t belong here. Q: If the outer world gets a hold of the Dulce technology and begins using it to colonize other worlds, could this alleviate the population, economic, environmental and other problems that this planet faces? In other words take away the IMPOSED barriers that have kept us earth-bound and in essence finally let us ""out of the cradle"", so to speak? The Greys for one do not wish Terrans to gain interstellar advantages and so become a threat to their own empirical agendas, and operating through various power-cults on earth they have succeeded in keeping interplanetary technology out of our hands and robbing us of our resources to finance the joint subterran and exterran projects, many of which projects and bases have been taken-over entirely by their own kind and at our expense. Once robbed of our resources the Greys use their psychological slaves on Earth to set us against each other and then turn around and say: ""Ha, you people are too violent to be allowed to have interstellar technology!"" Although there have been technology exchanges, it would seem that they are either being used as a ruse by the Greys to gain access to our society so that they can impose a global electronic dictatorship, and/or it is technology that is being provided by the Federation \'Nordics\' so that they can help defend planet earth for the mutual benefit of themselves and their human \'cousins\' on earth. What do you think about all of this? A: I believe without a doubt that we have been working on projects to colonize the moon, underground, and also to colonize Mars... I\'ve talked with scientists, I\'ve talked with former NASA astronauts who believe without a doubt that this is what\'s going on. They don\'t feel like its anything alien, some of the astronauts say they felt like, well this is just a technology that we\'ve developed on our own, and that certainly population is a problem that you have to think about way in advance and that humans have come to all of these conclusions themselves. I disagree, I think that it was an alien technology that was given to us (and/or recovered from ""crash sites""? - Branton), and I think that we\'re running with it, and we\'ve already started. Like with the Biosphere, a lot of people think that that is just for learning about our ecology and things like that, plants, animals and all of that. I know that was a front. I know of a lot of things that went on underground there. That is also an underground facility, it\'s a massive facility and it\'s a wonderful facility. The technology there being tested was alien technology. All this will be used when they start to colonize the moon and Mars. These are the two \'planets\' right now, actually the moon not so much being a planet (some argue that the Earth-Moon system is actually a ""double planet"". As for other planets, it might be logical to begin with the polar regions of Venus and the equatorial regions of Mars. - Branton) but a satellite of earth, but certainly its a stepping-stone away from earth to other places, and this is what\'s going on, I have no doubt about it. I\'ve talked to too many scientists who\'ve worked on covert or black projects for our government who have said that\'s exactly what we\'re doing... (I suppose the question I really had was is it actually OUR technology, or is it to be used ONLY by the alien-controlled ""human elite"" and NOT for the masses, who are instead to be ""de-populated"" through wars, plagues, infanticide and other genocidel eugenical methods? - Branton) I really believe that we don\'t have much longer here as a people to survive on earth, the climate will be vastly changing... so we have to have the technology to go somewhere else. That\'s what many of the aliens did themselves [long ago]. The aliens that I\'ve dealt with, the Ones who came from the constellation of Lyra... they actually had a massive explosion on their planet (caused by invading reptilian forces from Alpha Draconis, as some contactee accounts suggest? - Branton). They had to evacuate and migrated to the Pleiadean constellation where they knew other alien civilizations were already living. There are many different types of Pleiadean aliens, I cannot stress this enough to people who say, well there\'s only one Pleiadean race... (Note: The Pleiades star cluster actually consists of over 200 stars, or those stars INCLUDING SOL which ultimately revolve around the central stars of the Pleiadean cluster, more commonly known as the ""seven sisters"" - Branton) Some of \'my\' people also came into our system and settled on Mars, but something happened on that planet that forced them to go underground to live. Q: What would you consider the greatest weakness of the Greys to be? A: I can tell you right now that the main weakness of the Greys is that they have no soul, they are soulless. Do not allow them to tell you otherwise. Some of them have been known to try to impart some type of [false] religious philosophies on people that they\'ve abducted, and the thing is you have to realize that these aliens have their own agenda, and its not something that I feel is a positive one really. So I have found out from dealing with them most of my life, they are soulless, they have no soul, and when it comes to my religious beliefs or background -- I\'m not afraid to say it, I\'m a Christian, I believe in God, I believe in one ultimate being... God, who created all, all alien beings of all kinds... all different constellations where people have COLONIZED throughout the universe... beings, animals, things we probably have no idea about. Certainly I have to believe that the Greys are, the only way I can describe it is that they are an empty, empty case... There\'s nothing there other than a superior technology type of brain apparatus up in their skull area. Otherwise they are of no use to us really, they are really of no use. They are used to impart different technologies and give us information, but as far as trusting them, I do not trust them as far as I could throw them. Q: What do you think our greatest strength as human beings is? A: Well, our greatest strength is our belief in God... our greatest strength is [that] ability... and our only connection with each race is our connection with that one Supreme being, God. Now I do believe that God saw at some point in our history the need for someone to guide us into the positive way of living, I believe [that] Jesus was born as an example of the way that God would want us to live our lives... If we believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, the one and only God, then we have to believe that this is all true. I believe that He, Jesus, will be coming back... I believe in angels, I collect angels [artistic representations]. My best friend in Wisconsin sends be angel cards all the time, and I send her angel this, angel that, angel jewelry, angel statures, everything because I believe truly that angels walk among us. Believe me I have seen them, I\'ve dealt with them, I have spoken with them (for example, her experience aboard the ""mother ship"". However in THAT CASE we would have to ask if they were standing or fallen angels such as the rebel \'angels\' or fallen \'light beings\' that have been seen by abductees working in collaboration with Greys and Reptiloids on their starships? - Branton)... I have several close calls where I can only state that these angels have appeared out of just nowhere and saved my life, so I just have to believe that these are Gods beings [servants]... they\'re wonderful. (Note: Not wishing to detract from this atmosphere, however I do feel compelled to say that one should not trust any and every being that claims to be an \'angel\'. For instance fallen or rebel angels can state in all sincerity that they are \'angels\' and they would be correct -- however they might not tell you which \'variety\' of angel they are, or which side of the angelic conflict they serve, since there are BOTH standing and fallen angels. Fortunately however, there are twice as many standing angels in this universe as there are fallen angels, although the fallen angels seem to have a particular fascination with planet earth in that the nethermost depths of this planet is apparently the realm that they have chosen to make their ""last stand"" or their ""command headquarters"" -- in alliance with the serpent races which they incarnate -- in their ancient conflict with Michael and his legions of standing angels. The 12th chapter of Revelation is revealing in this regard, as it seems to generally convey a picture of a war in heaven between humanoids who are backed by standing angels and reptiloids who are backed by rebel angels, as well as a prophecy that the reptilian power-bases among the stars will be broken as the draconian forces retreat back to earth to make their last stand, and in so doing they from their cavernous empire will back and support a global dictatorship in a desperate effort to gain human allies for one last ditch ""do or die"" assault on the heavenly dominions. The thing to remember would be to use caution, since rebel angels have the ability to appear as ""angels of light"" to those who they are capable of deceiving. So examine their messages as though your soul depended on it, if you do happen to encounter such a being or beings. As for the Draconians themselves, in all fairness \'individual\' reptiloids are not the ultimate \'enemy\', the enemy is the LUCIFERIAN COLLECTIVE under which they serve, and the same can be said for the New World Order which is prophesied in the Book of Revelation -- those who are enslaved in this system by choice or deception are not the ultimate enemy, the Luciferian SYSTEM itself is the enemy! Something that is not often considered is the reptilian\'s perspective in regards to physical and spiritual survival. One of the problems is that the reptilians are intelligent and sentient enough -- thanks in part to the Luciferians who aided in destroying the original immortal status of both mankind and beasts -- to realize that when they die physically, they also die spiritually, due to the fact that they have no inherent \'soul\'. The reptilians fully realize this, and it terrifies them to no end. One of the reasons for the \'hybrid\' projects is not only to develop certain physical attributes within their race, but most importantly to give their posterity a \'soul\' so that they can survive beyond the grave, hopefully in an eternity of bliss rather than one of torment. We should not say that because a being has reptilian \'genes\', they are as a result \'evil\'. Evil is not genetic, but a choice one makes. Because of the fact that many of the reptilians are mere \'cells\' in a Luciferian collective \'HIVE\', it is not the individual reptilians that are at fault [if there is in fact such a thing as \'individual\' reptilians] so much as it is the HIVE itself. The HIVE must be the target of our attacks and especially any particular power-centers or mainframes that guide the Hive. Attempts should be made by humanoids on earth and beyond to attack the Hive and break individual reptilian \'cells\' free from its constraints. Once they are free and allowed to develop emotional individuality they should be given the choice to submit unconditionally to those Andro-Pleiadean Federation humanoid societies for instance who have succeeded in taming their own base \'animal\' natures. Since the reptiloids -- and especially the collective itself, lacking soul -- do not have the capability to \'TAME\' their own base predatory instincts, man-KIND must do this for them [GENESIS 1:28; 3:1,14-15]. Those reptilians which will not submit to re-programming and refuse to SURRENDER to this process, should give up their right to experience a \'supervised\' free agency and should as a result be subdued by FORCE... otherwise the human races throughout the galaxy or even the universe will have to live under eternal chaos -- forever plagued and tormented by races driven ONLY by base predatory instincts, because humankind had failed to take responsibility as the divinely-commissioned guardians of the creation. First however we must accept that a Divine ORDER was originally established for the universe, beginning with the Almighty Creator and descending through the various angelic hierarchies, through humankind, followed by the reptiloid races who originally held a position somewhere between mankind and the beasts, and following this the lower animal kingdoms and finally the nature kingdom itself. This is the original divinely-ordered hierarchy through which divine LIFE from the SOURCE of all creation cascades down from the higher to the lower levels. If this hierarchy is broken like it was as a result of INTERVENTION by the fallen angelic\'s, then UNITY and CONTINUITY is destroyed and CHAOS reigns. So if one gets the sense that this volume is attacking reptilian\'s simply because they are reptilian, then they are not looking to the deeper message. I am NOT advocating the all-out extermination of the draconian races, I am only advocating that they must of their own choice OR through force -- whichever they \'choose\' -- submit to the divinely-established ORDER which was initiated from the very genesis of intelligent physical life on planet earth, and subsequently throughout the universe itself. - Branton). The following is ""A CASE SIMILAR TO THE TILTON CASE"", as reported by Val Valerian in MATRIX-II, the Donavon Masters story: ""The following is what I believe to be a very real experience, which I believe ties into the experiences of Christa Tilton. Three of my friends and I were taken to what I perceived to be an underground government facility or UFO base. I say \'friends\' because that is how I perceived them, although I had not met them at the time. I remember feeling as though I had been drugged, as if everything was kind of going in slow motion. We were placed on and strapped to a conveyor belt by our wrists and ankles. The conveyor was activated and as it began to move, our bodies were passed through blocks of pure intense light. These blocks of light -- perhaps laser scanning devices -- were either green or blue in color. At each block of light there was what I perceived to be a robot controller. They also were either green or blue in color. Their color corresponded to the color of the light in front of which they stood. The robots were in human form but with no distinguishable human characteristics. Along the wall in the first room were barrels of some substance which had a very pungent odor. These barrels were stacked, one on top of the other. ""Suddenly we were on a different conveyor belt or at the end of the first one. As the belt moved around a circular console, it stopped. There were two men -- human in form and characteristics -- seated at the console. One assisted the other. One of them picked up what I thought was a razor and shaved an area on my back left side just below the waist line. I remember that the spot bled considerably. I was released and they began to do the same procedure on my friends. I remember thinking over and over -- \'What is happening to me?\' He replied, \'You have just been implanted with your government control extension number.\' I remember grabbing a mirror and looking at the area that bled. The number \'04\' was there. In a very upset manner I turned to a woman in a uniform and exclaimed, \'You can\'t do this to me!\' Incidentally, all of the personnel in this facility wore uniforms. I then ran back to the console where I was released. By that time my friends had also been released. I hurriedly told them what I had discovered was happening to us. As I was speaking, the two men at the console were gathering materials hurriedly, in what seemed like an attempt to escape. In particular I remember the man that had implanted the number on me had a computer print-out list. He protected this list with his life, as my friends and I ran after him and the other man. They escaped through a set of double doors (was the drug-induced state of semi-consciousness beginning to wear off unexpectedly? - Branton). I sincerely believe that Christa Tilton was also in this facility at that time -- although I don\'t think this was our first meeting. ""I will never forget the first time I talked with Christa on the phone. It was September 20, 1987. I felt as though I was hearing the voice of an old friend, as though I had known her all my life. She later sent me a picture of herself which only solidified that feeling. When I saw that picture I had flashbacks of seeing her aboard a craft! It was a very emotional moment for me, seeing her again.Since that time a beautiful and enduring friendship of unconditional love has developed. She is truly a flower in the garden of my life and a TRUE friend. Like Christa, I have been plagued by intense, repetitive dreams of meetings and communications with what appear to be non-human, other-worldly beings. I am also continually frustrated by my inability to learn the truth about my experiences, although Christa has been a tremendous help in my search for the truth -- proving that when people work together for a common goal, much is accomplished... ""Although Christa and myself are not alone, I suggest that there are thousands out there like ourselves, perhaps afraid to seek out help and a better understanding of their experiences because of the fear of ridicule. It is a truth that sometimes life can be very cruel because of the ignorance or lack of knowledge concerning this vast, exotic subject. Then maybe some, like the ostrich, stick their heads in the sand because they are afraid to question their own fates."" source:http://www.thewatcherfiles.com/dulce/chapter25.htm', '15 Sightings of UFOs near Dayton, Ohio, October, 1973Part of the Great UFO Wave of 1973: Reported Near DaytonDayton, Ohio (UPI) - At least 15 sightings of unidentified flying objects ""covered with red, green and blue lights"" zooming about at tree-top level, were reported in Southwestern Ohio Wednesday night.The UFO\'s, sighted in the Dayton-Cincinnati area, were all classified ""unofficial"" by Wright-Patterson Air Force Base officials. None were detected on radar because they apparently were flying too low.The first sighting was reported shortly after 8 p.m. by a New Lebanon Township officer.""He didn\'t want to say he saw it, but he said it,"" Montgomery County Sheriff\'s deputy Michael Sullivan reported.""The officer said it was oblong and covered with lights. It appeared stationary in the sky about tree top level for several minutes until he tried to shine his cruiser spot light on it,"" Sullivan said. ""It then zoomed toward him and then shot straight up in the air... after he turned out his light... and disappeared.""Sullivan said the UFO sightings lasted from a fleeting moment to 12 minutes.""They would be behind the trees and come up and fly away... as if you startled it or something,"" he said.""No balloon, helicopter or kite can move that fast or has that many lights attached or can go so quickly in a straight-up direction,"" he said.A spokesman at Wright-Patterson, whose UFO center was discontinued several years ago, said there would be no attempt to investigate the sightings unless there was an ""imminent danger.""Sullivan said his officers \'certainly can\'t chase them.""source: The Columbus Dispatch, October 11, 1973', ' 1973, The Doraty Abduction, Houston, TexasHouston,TX 1973. One of the few UFO encounter cases which also involved animal mutilation occurred in May, 1973, and involved four women. Judy Doraty, her daughter Cindy, Judy\'s mother and sister-in-law would have the most terrifying experience of their lives. After playing Bingo in Houston, the four women were returning to Judy\'s home town of Texas City, but first going by Alto Loma to drop off Judy\'s sister and brother-in-law. After dropping off the two in Alto Loma, the remaining four saw a strange light, which seemed to be hovering in the night sky. The sight was intriguing enough that the four women stopped, and got out of the car to get a clearer look at the source of the light. They watched in awe until the light disappeared. They then resumed their trip to Texas City.Eventually, Judy began to suffer from extreme headaches and anxiety. After being seen and dismissed by several doctors, she was referred to well-known Ufologist and hypnotist Dr. Leo Sprinkle. Sprinkle\'s previous experience with the UFO enigma led him to recommend hypnosis as a way to relieve Judy of her emotional trauma. There can be little doubt that Sprinkle suspected an abduction from the beginning.Under hypnosis, it was revealed that Judy had apparently been abducted aboard an extra-terrestrial spacecraft. Judy went on in detail, describing how a cow was taken up into the craft and methodically mutilated by two ""small entities.""During the hypnotic regression, Judy described the unusual sensation of being in two places at once. She said that she was still standing beside her car after they stopped to watch the strange light in the sky. However, Judy also said that at the same time, she was in a strange chamber watching the gruesome experiment unfolding before her eyes. Footage of this regression was included in Linda Moulton-Howe\'s award-winning documentary ""Strange Harvests.""In a 1989 interview on 21st Century Radio, Linda Howe divulged what had been learned from the experience of Judy Doraty:""Judy described . . . in a pale beam of yellow light, a small brown and white calf being taken up into a craft. Then, in an extraordinary way,  [Judy) was inside the craft, and she watches the calf have pieces of it excised: the tongue, the sex organs, the eyes...?"" Some of Sprinkle\'s hypnosis session is included below:Sprinkle asks,  ""Is there anyone around you?"" There was this long, almost forty-five-second pause, and then she said: ""two little men."" ""[The two beings) were about three and a half to four feet tall; grey creatures with large egg-shaped heads."" ""It\'s like a spotlight shining down on the back of my car. And it\'s like it has substance to it. I can see an animal being taken up in this. I can see it squirming and trying to get free. And it\'s like it\'s being sucked up."" She then went on to mention seeing her daughter Cindy on an \'operating\' table. She went on: ""They don\'t listen, they just ignore me....go about their work as if it\'s nothing. They don\'t seem to have any emotions. They don\'t seem to care. They just take some samples from her...""It would be a number of years later when Judy\'s daughter Cindy would also undergo regressive hypnosis. Her session only corroborated her mother\'s. Statement by Judy Doraty on February 01, 2003 at 19:48:28:First I must say there is no doubt that abductions exist. My abduction took place in 1973. There were 16 eye witnesses to the craft,  though not all remember an abduction. My daughter who was 14 at the time and myself. This was first reported to Ellington airforce base in Texas, who denied anything was on radar at the time. Our abduction was also returning from a bingo game in Houston, to our home in Texas City, first going by Alta Loma to drop off sister and brother in law. There was another sighting of three people coming from a bingo game in Houston that got burned by the effects of the sighting. Our sighting was almost a year before theirs. So much happened that night I would not attempt to go in detail, we were all changed and have never been the same since. We were first ridiculed so much by others who were not present (family mostly) I did not talk about it for a few years. Then my husband returned home from Viet Nam and we were stationed in Yuma, AZ.  I somehow heard about APRO. I called them and told them about my sighting and the very next day, a Mr. Daugherty and his wife and a doctor. who had experience in hypnosis named Rose Tennant came to my house and spent the entire day going over what happened. Dr. Tenant regressed me and a few details came out or shall I say surfaced. I had been having terrible migraines, and just the amount of surfacing relieved much. I know I remembered a formula that was given to me by the small gray alien. I think that is what caused a lot of problems. I did not say anything to anyone else as I was still gun-shy and afraid of ridicule. A few years later I got a call from a lady Named Linda Howe. We talked a long time her trying to convince me I needed to be regressed again for a TV documentary she was doing called the Strange Harvest.For some reason I began to trust her as she convinced me she believed what I was saying. And as all abductees know this is one of the most important things to help one get on with their life. In my abduction I witnessed a small calf being transported in a LARGE CRAFT. At that time I somehow was teleported or astroprojected or something, as I was in the craft seeing what was going on as well as standing by my car I had gotten out of to see what the huge light was that had been pacing our car for about twenty miles or so. Anyway I allowed a DR. Leo Sprinkle from the University of Wyoming to do his regression.It was about a three hour regression, I fulfilled MS. Howe\'s agenda she got an Emma for her documentary, but I was left with all the information in my head that still needed syphoning. I asked her to help me write a book to be able to tell the amazing things that I was told and shown. She agreed and then kept putting it off.Both her and Dr. Sprinkle used my case for their own agenda and had little else to say to me. I guess I am trying to warn all of you to be careful who you trust. My main concern was I always wanted my abduction to be presented in a way that it would not be construed as a crazy woman venting her boredom. So again I pulled myself in a shell and talked to no one. I was contacted by Sightings to do a follow up and I called Linda Howe she told me it would make the story unbelievable to the average person and I should not do it, so I turned them down. Later I learned she a a rift with Mr. Wrinklier and that was the only reason she did not want me to be on the show. Then about ten years ago I was told by someone in the UFO community who was familiar with my case that Ms. Howe had gone to Kirkland airforce base was warned to keep my mouth shut but Ms. Howe never told this to me. She told a ufologist who called me. In other words the government did not want me to say anything about a formula I was given. I became frightened and this is the first time I have shared anything. I hope some one reads this that will contact me and give me advice or help as the abduction is 30 years old, I am 63 and before I die I would love to know what many already know, and why they do not want my story told...thanks for listening.

She stopped and had coffee with a friend, then stopped for gas and then headed for home in nearby Goffstown, about eight miles west of Manchester. As she reached the outskirts of Manchester on highway 114, she noticed a bright light in the sky. At first it was yellow, but then it flashed red and blue and green colors. She thought that was a bit odd, but she drove on, thinking it to be a planet. After driving about a mile, she noticed that it stayed in the same place in relation to her field of vision, but that it seemed to be getting brighter. As Lydia neared the intersection of highways 114 and 114A, she lit a cigarette. As she did, the light blinked out, but reappeared after she had gone though the intersection. It reappeared in the same spot, ahead and to the left of her. As she drove on to Goffstown and into the city, the light vanished and then reappeared twice more, seeming to be a little brighter each time. After she drove though Goffstown on highway 114, she was surprised to see the light reappear again, straight ahead of her, even brighter and closer than before. So much closer, in fact, that she could make out details. She could see that it was an orange and gold globe covered with hexagons like a honeycomb, with an oval window on the upper left. The red, green, and blue flashes were coming from somewhere near the center of the object, and she could hear a high-pitched sound. Lyndia later reported that she suddenly found that she was unable to remove her hands from the car's steering wheel. She felt that the object was taking control of her and the car and pulling them to itself. The speed of her car was increasing against her will as she passed Westlawn Cemetery. The object grew closer and closer. When it was only a few hundred feet away, Lyndia could see a figure in the window. She saw what she described as a smallish humanoid figure standing behind a console of some sort. The figure had a round, grayish head, a wrinkled face, a down turned slit of a mouth, and two large eyes with dark pupils. She felt that he was sending her a telepathic message to be unafraid. If she was, the message did not work, because Lyndia was terrified. Somehow, she was able to slow the car and turn into the driveway of a house just past the cemetery. She jumped out of the car and ran to the kitchen door of the house, ignoring a German shepherd dog that growled and barked at her. She pounded on the door and rang the bell and yelled for help as the UFO moved to a position across the street, hovering and watching her, still emitting that high-pitched sound. Finally, the residents, Mr. And Mrs. Beaudoin, came to the door. They opened the door to a terrified woman who was covering her ears and claiming that a UFO was after her. The Beaudoins could not see or hear anything, but Mrs. Beaudoin called the police. When Goffstown Officer Daniel Jubinville arrived, he found Lyndia's car in the driveway with the lights on and the motor still running. He went in and listened to Lyndia's story, noting in his report that she did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. As Walter Webb has noted, the planet Mars was near its brightest and was in the Western part of the sky where Lyndia saw the object. However, that does not explain the other events that she claimed occurred. Note also that this sighting occurred only about 100 miles from the site of the 1961 Betty & Barney Hill abduction event. source:www.about.comLoy Lawhorn "", 'Princeton, Indiana, Disc With Cupola, August, 1973  A reputable witness: ""We were over at my mother-in-law\'s in Mt. Carmel, and that\'s about 11 miles from Princeton where I live, and it was evening and there was a storm coming up and we got upset over there. We had some bad experiences. A tree blew down and we decided to leave. We stopped at a filling station and got some gas and then we proceeded on to Princeton through the (Wabash River) bottoms and a, (of) course this was the time about when they were building PSI (the Public Service Indiana power plant) on the right hand side of the road. ""And we saw what appeared (now it was dark) to be a couple of headlites. Well, we assumed they were maybe a temperature inversion, but then we got to thinking that during a thunderstorm or rainstorm you\'re not going to have a temperature inversion, it\'s going to be kinda stirred up. But directly in line with this was Owensville Rd. We thought maybe they might be headlites bouncing off of low clouds. These (lights) were up in the air.  ""Our angle of perspective changed as we approached it. So we found out it was above the trees. The lightning caught up with us about this time and a pretty-good-sized bolt was behind it and we got it illuminated all around us and we saw what we appeared to be a saucer. Kinda weird, but the whole family witnessed it and nothing was said until we got home. ""What surprised me, of course, we thought it was a car because it was the same spectral response that you\'d have (received) from headlights, you know, the infra-red region, HEAVY in the infra-red. As we got closer to it, before the lightning struck, we saw what looked like clearance lights, one on each side of it. Later on it proved to be four, of whatever the light was, dotted around the cupola. And beneath it was a super-dark cone which apexed below the tree level. And this thing (the cone) didn\'t appear to be solid, the cone that came down to the ground or whatever it went down to. It was sort of wide at the bottom of the saucer and evidently went to a point which would have been the opposite of a flashlight beam. And, ah, we kinda got a shock over it.  ""I\'d done a little snooping around during some rainstorms seeing if we could see it again, my oldest boy and I, back in where we thought it was in the woods. ""As you come outside of Mt. Carmel and are proceeding towards Princeton, you\'ll find a large woods with a bunch of little spots where they\'ve cut out to plant popcorn, I think, and corn. And it was over one of these patches, in fact it was the exact location where this Cavanaugh girl was found. ""There is one thing. We\'ve discussed this, the family and my oldest boy (he\'s 15 now), this is a good topic for us, inter-family. Ah, if these were lights shining on out, I would think they were more outside, than in, because if there were anyone inside this thing they would have been almost blind because the lights, if these were portholes, I\'m saying, they would have to be almost blind because the lights were almost the same illumination as car headlights, although we didn\'t see any beams shooting out from them as you would on a car. ""But the cone beneath it seemed to be, well, what I\'d seen in laser, except on a much grander scale, in a different light spectrum. Of course in a storm you\'ll have heavy in ultra-violet, and ah, which could have made a red appear black, or any color would be off-color. Maybe there is something here in a beam, you know, like a laser. I think they (U.S. scientists) are doing experiments with green lasers that actually support objects. Why not?  ""Another little injection here. It looked archaic, something out of Jules Verne, like a pickled metal, you know what I mean? When a piece of metal is heat-treated, pickled, a burnished silver color? It looked like this, well, you\'d almost say you saw the rivets on the damned thing. Of course I didn\'t see any rivets. It was old-fashioned looking, not streamlined, (but) straight up and down, the cupola, with a little rolled edge on it. And ah, nothing ultra-modern that you would associate with space travel or something like this. I don\'t really believe the damned thing came from outer space (laughing). I mean, it doesn\'t ah, seem... ""Usually there is an explanation, but this damned thing, there wasn\'t any explanation for me (laughing again), you know, it was there, solid. ""The damned thing was sitting awfully still, to be...it moved in from the west, or let\'s see, east, and then kinda stopped and started down. And so smooth and determined in its movements. It wasn\'t being affected by the storm any. ""I\'d say about 30\' above the tree-level, five, six-hundred feet away, I\'d imagine. I would estimate it about 30-40\' (wide). Of course, I\'m not very good on judging distances or sizes of objects. I overestimated (driving) because I thought it was landing or going down into a field which was just on the other side of the woods is an open field. So, I speeded up and went up there, and it had went down into the woods. So I had overshot my estimate there. We slowed down and watched it to almost a stop, I\'d say three or four minutes. All the time we had good lighting from the lightning. Of course, I\'d say it was ultra-violet, and this does make the colors...screws up the colors. It changes the shades heavy ultra-violet.

Princeton, Indiana (USA)  Witnesses: 3  Evaluation: Berliner: 04/02  Francis Ridge, Field Investigator:', '1973 - The Alabama Tinfoil AlienAliens come in all shapes and sizes, from the little green men of Kelly, Kentucky, to the 10-foot-tall giants of Voronezh, Russia. There has always been discussion about the close encounters of the third kind aliens.Some of these seem to be living, breathing beings, and yet some appear to have characteristics of a robot. One theory readily accepted by investigators is that many of the UFO sightings are of ""scout"" ships who take exploratory journeys to our planets surface, while a mother ship hovers somewhere out of sight.Many propose that these scout ships are occupied by a robotic, mechanical being. These would be expendable in carrying out experimentation on unwilling humans, and also on our flora and animal kingdom.Many of the earlier stories of alien sightings are ""sensationalized,"" to say the least. But sticking to my own rule of evaluating each case on its own merits, one report which seems to have some merit occurred in Falkville, Alabama, on October 17, 1973.This case is unique in some respects, most notably the alien seems to have attributes of both of the above descriptions: a robot looking creature with the running gait of our most talented athletes.This strange account began when Falkville, Alabama police chief Jeff Greenhaw (that is correct, there is no s after the n), received a phone call from an excited lady who said that she had witnessed a ""spaceship"" land in an open field not far the town proper.Greenhaw took off like a shot, taking along his trusty Polaroid camera. Dark had fallen several hours earlier, and the police chief was armed for anything. It would be about 10:00 P.M. when he made it to the location of the alleged landing.After a cursory look around, he found no trace of a spaceship. As Greenhaw continued his search of the area, he was taken aback by the sight of an alien-like creature standing just off the side of the road.The being appeared to be wrapped in aluminum foil as it began to walk toward Greenhaw.""It looked like his head and neck were kind of made together... he was real bright, something like rubbing mercury on nickel, but just as smooth as glass; different angles give different lighting. I don\'t believe it was aluminum foil.""The tinfoil alien\'s movements were very ""mechanical"" like. An antenna was attached to his head. Though in shock, he managed to snap off four pictures of the odd looking alien. When he flicked on his headlights the alien was obviously frightened, as it began to make its escape.Tinfoil Alien Greenhaw immediately took off in his truck in pursuit, but because of the rough terrain of the field, he was only able to manage 35 MPH. The robotic movements of the alien were now in high gear and it raced across the open field.Greenhaw could not keep up, and the tinfoil being escaped into the night.""He was running faster than any human I ever saw,"" he stated.Although Greenhaw was exhilarated by the strange encounter, he would soon regret the whole affair. He was mocked and ridiculed by many of the town folk, and he received threatening phone calls.A string of bad luck began to affect his life also. Whether related to his report or not, his house burned down, and his wife left him.Approximately a month after the incident, the town council fired him. So much for the theory that reports of many UFO encounters are made by individuals who are looking for notoriety or financial gain.Greenhaw would eventually regain some semblance of a normal life, but he would always regret the night he met the tin foil alien.(written by B J Booth, 2002)']"
1951, ,"['1951, The Fort Monmouth UFO CaseThe Fort Monmouth Case. By Wendy Connors and Mike HallThe Fort Monmouth Case began with a watershed event which took place at 11:18 A.M. EDT on a clear morning in September 1951. It was Monday the 10th. The place was a radar facility near the coastline at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. A young student Army Signal Corps radar operator, PFC Eugent A. Clark, had just picked up an unknown low-flying target moving faster than the automatic setting mode on his AN/MPG-1 radar set could plot.  As a matter of coincidence, a number of visiting Army officers happened to be standing behind Clark at the time, witnessing the strange event unfold. They watched in amazement as in just moments the curious radar blip traversed the coast line at an estimated speed of at least 700 miles per hour. It was lost off the scope near the Sandy Hook coastal peninsula, not far south of New York City.  This radar tracking caused a lot of excitement. In 1951, although jets had reached such speeds in special tests, they flew nowhere near those velocities on a routine or even sustained basis.  Seventeen minutes later, the story became even more bizarre. Just south of Sandy Hook, at 11:35 A.M. EDT, a T-33 jet trainer piloted by Lieutenant Wilbert S. Rogers, with Major Edward Ballard Jr. in the rear seat, encountered a completely unrecognizable object. They were flying northward at 20,000 feet over Point Pleasant, New Jersey headed toward Sandy Hook. At that moment Rogers spotted off to his left a dull, silvery object passing far below on an opposing parallel course. It was southward bound in from the coastline peninsula of Sandy Hook and appeared to be about 12,000 feet below them. Rogers had been on a direct pre-approach heading toward a landing into Mitchel AFB, New York, but wanted Major Ballard to have a look at it. Ballard, however, was on the radio so Rogers turned slightly to the left to linger and waited for him to complete his radio communication. Forty-five seconds later Ballard had caught sight of it, by which time the UFO entered a descending arc-like turn that was about to cut under their flight path. At that moment the pilots\' conversations were heard by ground control via an open mike.  Records show the pilots were excited as both men were watching the object bank. As it did, it revealed a \'discus-like\' silhouette while continuing its turn. So Rogers kept turning left with it to keep it from going under his wing and thus out of view. While the object proceeded to descend further, Rogers nosed his jet down to eventually complete a hair raising 360-degree, 3,000 feet descending maneuver, just to keep it in sight.  Both Rogers and Ballard estimated the craft to be around 30 to 50 feet in diameter and perhaps moving as fast as 700 miles per hour. By then the pilots knew that they were definitely not chasing a balloon because this thing was not only banking left but was by then out-pacing their jet which Rogers had throttled up from 450 to 550 miles per hour! By that point the object had completed a 90 degree turn and was heading away from the coastline, traveling out over the ocean in level flight near the speed of sound at around 5,000 feet. Rogers vainly attempted to parallel its course from his current altitude of 17,000 feet as the UFO continued to increase its speed out to sea, covering 35 miles during the short two minute span of the sighting.  Rogers, an experienced WWII fighter pilot, was later asked by a reporter what he thought it was that they had seen that day. He shrugged and only said that the object was something he had never seen before in his life, and it certainly wasn\'t a balloon because it was not only descending but moving at great speed. He added that the object looked perfectly round and flat with the center of the object being somewhat raised.  But was it a balloon? Two months later when Edward Ruppelt assumed the helm of the old Grudge project from Jerry Cummings, he carefully disseminated the information that had been collected on the case. Ruppelt was as intrigued as anyone with this fantastic sighting, and no one more than himself respected the experience of veteran flyers like Rogers and Ballard. Yet, Ruppelt put objectivity first. He even fired three assistants from his project in those early days who became too biased in their approach to investigations.  It was one of Ruppelt\'s more trusted associates, Henry \'Hank\' Metscher, who came up with what he felt was a solid argument that the sighting over Point Pleasant and the radar data from Fort Monmouth may have been attributable to balloon launches. Ruppelt relied on Metscher\'s more seasoned engineering background and careful analysis to compose a special November 30 status report to the Pentagon. It stated: ""At approximately 11:12 EDST, 10 September 1951 two balloons were released from the Evans Signal Laboratory, New Jersey, . . . and would have moved into a position nearly in line with Point Pleasant.""  Provided are illustrations from that report plotting the balloons and the course of the T-33 jet. Air Force records do prove that balloons were in the same area at the same time as the T-33, yet estimates place their altitude at 18,000 feet as opposed to the 5,000 feet ceiling Rogers approximated for the UFO. Those same records also show each balloon burst at a height of 104,000 feet not long after the incident transpired.  To provide further detail, following is an excerpt from Ruppelt\'s unedited manuscript to The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects. This paragraph never made it into his published book but does detail how ATIC viewed the case at the time:  The sighting by the two officers in the T-33 jet fell apart when Metscher learned that a balloon had been launched in the area of the sighting just a matter of minutes before the UFO was seen. Hank got out an aeronautical chart and plotted the path of the balloon, the path of the T-33, and the reported path of the UFO. The first thing that showed up was that the balloon was always along the line of sight between the T-33 and where the two officers thought the UFO had been. With a little more figuring Hank showed how every reported motion of the UFO could have been due to the relative motion between the balloon and the T-33, and the observer\'s inability to accurately estimate distances, since they didn\'t know how big their ""UFO"" really was. Colonel Rosengarten told the authors that he and Lt. Jerry Cummings personally questioned Rogers and Ballard. Although he too greatly respected their years of flying experience, Rosengarten is fairly convinced after talking to them that they simply saw a balloon under unusual circumstances. He also feels  that a balloon with foil reflectors on it, accounted for the earlier radar sightings.  After news accounts of the pilot\'s incident leaked to the papers, state  police officials were queried by reporters, but no collaborating testimony could be found to substantiate the sighting of an unusual object.  Yet another incident did occur that same afternoon of the 10th. Again, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey radar picked up a strange target. This time it was 18 miles above the earth traveling slowly. Soon, ground observers visually confirmed it even though all they could see was a silver speck in the sky. While Cummings conclusively proved that sighting was attributed to a balloon launch, more unexplained radar sightings followed the next day.  On September 11, a brief summary of the T-33 sighting was sent to ATIC from the 148th interceptor group at Dover AFB, Delaware, where Rogers and Ballard were based. On the next, day Wilbert Rogers himself followed up with another and much more carefully detailed summary to Dayton, addressed to none other than the Commanding General of the AMC! Fort Monmouth forwarded accounts too of the anomalous radar incidents. Then both pilots were debriefed at Stewart AFB, Newburg, New York, on the 17th by Eastern Air Defense Force Headquarters officials who on the 21st sent a summary of all of the sightings to ATIC as well as the ADC headquarters in Colorado Springs.  This was done according to several official regulations of the time requiring the reporting of unidentified aerial objects. These included Air Defense Command Letter 200-1 of 11 April 1951 requiring the reporting of ""unconventional aircraft,"" and an Eastern Air Defense Force directive of 19 February 1951, stipulating the same. Along with these new regulations was a directive from the Continental Air Defense Command in an earlier issuance of 200-1 dated 22 February 1951. It required any reports to be classified ""confidential."" However, as will be detailed, these same reports were apparently caught in a paper shuffle and did not make it to Major General Cabell, the head of Air Force Intelligence (AFOIN), in a timely fashion. This fact becomes the basis for the story to follow, namely because news of the T-33 sighting would first be leaked to the press. This leak came long before Cabell had a chance to be properly briefed on these seemingly fantastic events, which were not easily explainable at the time.  In setting the stage for this tale of a classic military snafu, it is also important to note that at that time Cabell had come under pressure by some American industrialists and scientists who felt the Air Force should be more responsive to UFO reports. Top among those influential men were Robert Johnson and a Mr. Brewster of Republic Aviation. Republic carried a lot of weight at that time because they were at the cutting edge of high speed fighter development. In fact, research then going on at Republic would lead directly to the F-105 Thunderchief which gained great fame during the Vietnam war a decade later.  Top people at Republic like Johnson and Brewster had an unusually tenacious interest in the early flying saucer sightings. The details are unclear, but AFOSI files show that both men learned of the Fort Monmouth cases and asked permission from the Eastern Air Defense Command to speak to Rogers and Ballard around September 20, still long before Cabell had been briefed on the incidents.  During their interview, Brewster showed the air crew ""sketches,"" possibly of experimental aircraft. Yet, both pilots told Brewster and Johnson that they had seen no indications of exhaust or propulsion units on the UFO. Records even show Brewster speculative of electrical propulsion of some kind. Brewster explained that he had names of other witnesses, who supposedly had similar sightings and were also interviewed by him and Johnson.  Aviation historian Joel Carpenter recently shared some interesting insights on why Republic may have been so interested in UFOs. As in many other instances, it seems that curiosity in flying saucers had less to do with astrophysical theories than the hard realities of the Cold War:  Each of the airframe contractors in the 40s and 50s had a specialty, and Republic\'s was fighters. They had an ace designer named Alexander Kartveli who was very interested in supersonic aerodynamics and came up with some very radical concepts for early jet fighters. (The P-84 that was running up at Muroc when the first disc sighting was made there was one of his designs.) In those days, Air Defense Command (or maybe still CONAD then) Hq was located at Mitchel Field, Long Island, and since Republic was right down the road in Farmingdale, it had an ³in² with the fighter command. Republic did a lot of studies for CONAD on the problems of how to use fighters to intercept high-speed bombers. If a bomber is flying near the speed of sound, it is very hard to detect it with radar, scramble the fighter, get the fighter to the exact point where it can fire its weapons, and shoot at exactly the right instant to hit the target. . . You can see why the Ft. Monmouth incident would have had a bearing on this, if the radar operators were tracking UFOs that were going too fast to be jets, what could possibly be done about them? So I think that the Republic men might have been in the Cabell meeting [when Cabell was finally briefed on the Ft. Monmouth incidents in detail on November 1] as experts on the problems of intercepting high-speed targets. The other aspect of this is that just a couple of days before the Cabell meeting, Republic had been awarded a contract to build one of the most incredible aircraft ever designed, the XF-103. This was a true interceptor. . . projects like the XF-103 take years to develop and they probably thought that by the time it was operational, the Soviets might have supersonic bombers. General Cabell had maintained an interest in the UFO mystery since he became director of AFOIN in May of 1948 but for whatever reason had delegated much of the responsibility to subordinates. By  1949, after the Sidney Shallet article, flying saucers were de-emphasized and collection memos for acquiring information on sightings were rescinded. Grudge officially closed in December of that year although work still went on at ATIC as new sighting reports were handled through routine intelligence channels. Cabell, however, who later characterized the Grudge final report as ""the most poorly written piece of unscientific tripe I\'ve ever read,"" seemed ready by late 1950 and early 1951 for a more active approach. It is not known why Cabell suddenly took greater interest in flying saucer reports by that time. An extensive reorganization had been completed by mid-1951 which had previously occupied a great deal of his attention. Perhaps by then, he simply had more time to devote to the subject of UFOs as a whole, during a period in which there was already growing concern about possible Soviet developments in heavy high speed bombers.  It does seem once war in Korea began in June 1950, that Cabell was quietly reconsidering the specific issue of flying saucer reports. In fact, at that time he may have come to the realization that his subordinates in AFOIN and Colonel Watson at ATIC were of the growing opinion that they had more important tasks at hand than dealing with the saucer sightings. This may be why they put such great emphasis on downplaying the investigations, so as not to make flying saucers an issue either privately or publicly.  We know by late 1950 collection memos on UFOs were re-issued and Major General Cabell started to express concern over what he saw as a continually troubling series of saucer reports. Colonel Watson and his deputy commander, Colonel Frank Dunn, were aware of this in particular. Cabell\'s office even later sent word down that he was to be awakened during the middle of the night if he was needed! Colonel Watson, although a very distinguished and respected officer, still apparently had a skepticism when it came to flying saucers. He continued to frown on anyone who claimed to have witnessed a  sighting. However, it does seem his deputy, Frank Dunn, did succeed him somewhere around the timeframe in which the Fort Monmouth incidents occurred.  (The records show Colonel Watson was officially reassigned around July of 1951 yet because he was then resisting leaving his beloved ATIC command, Watson may have still been in Dayton, trying to get Cabell to either change his orders to an Air Defense Command, or preferably to stay at ATIC. This would account for the fact that Ruppelt and Cummings both recalled in their correspondence that Watson had something to do with this story but also remember that his orders for reassignment came in before the Fort Monmouth events all played out.)  We do know from Ruppelt\'s private papers that Cabell by at least early 1951 had caught wind of Colonel Watson\'s hesitancy to divert significant manpower to saucer investigations. Ruppelt mentions that Cabell, at some point, climbed all over Watson and his Pentagon accomplices like Colonel Porter for ""conspiring to kill the UFO project.""  It is known that Watson\'s friend, Albert Deyarmond, remained at ATIC after the Colonel accepted a command in Europe. Thus ""Moose"" Deyarmond remained a key man in the ATIC hierarchy as Colonel Dunn filled Watson\'s shoes. It certainly seems Deyarmond continued to enforce Colonel Watson\'s so-called anti-saucer policies, as did Analysis Chief Colonel Brunow W. Feiling. The authors do not fully understand why because we also know Deyarmond was privately very interested in the subject and had been a strong supporter of an objective study when he was a member of Project Sign back in 1948. We also know that Ruppelt always understood him to be personally convinced in an extraterrestrial hypothesis for the origin of the phenomena.  Nevertheless, Colonel Watson\'s skeptical saucer policy still seemed to be in effect at ATIC by the fall of 1951. In fact, when word of the incredible Fort Monmouth sightings were officially reported to ATIC on the 11th and 12th from Dover AFB and the EADC at Newburg on the 21st, the accounts were dismissed by Colonel Feiling. Feiling completely bypassed Grudge and gave the reports directly to James Rodgers, who was by then no longer even in charge of Grudge.  Although the files do suggest that Colonel Dunn had learned of the incidents as early as the 11th. Records explain that on the 11th, the Air Materiel Command\'s Public Information Officer, Colonel Taylor, acquired a summary of the pilot\'s sighting from his counterpart at Mitchel AFB, PIO Major John B. Barron. Taylor passed the summary onto Colonel Dunn via Rex Smith, AMC Assistant PIO, on that same day. Yet the Pentagon never received any follow-up investigation from ATIC.  To Dunn\'s later horror, the only report that did make its way to Washington was initiated via that curious correspondence between PIO officers to a Colonel Carter of the Field Liaison Section, Directorate of Public Information in the Pentagon. When these sightings subsequently found their way to the national media as early as the 12th, Cabell eventually blew his top. We say ""eventually"" because, oddly, the General didn\'t catch wind of it until long after those press leaks made national headlines in papers like the Washington Daily News and The New York Times. Further, Cabell did not seem to learn about any of this until the 27th or 28th of that month! (The leak first originated from Mitchel AFB when Major Barron allowed a Long Island newspaper reporter, Dick Aurelio, to interview the pilot after Aurelio heard rumors of the sighting.)  Cabell had already told ATIC he wanted personal notification on any new UFO activity, and now he had to read about this outwardly amazing series of cases from a press desk circular that happened to cross his desk, 18 days after the event occurred!  After the news made headlines, the Air Defense Command also wanted more information. They had not received a final report on the sightings even though it involved pilots of its own [Eastern] Air Defense Command. ADC thus wanted Grudge on it right away, but they had no idea that the project had become so understaffed.  As Cabell attempted to wade through this horrendous mess on Friday morning of the 28th, his wartime years as a Pentagon assistant to the Commanding General of Army Air Forces, General ""Hap"" Arnold, may have come back to haunt him. Cabell had held a unique job as a trouble shooter on Arnold\'s personal staff during the madness following the attack on Pearl Harbor. That act by the Japanese, and the shortcomings which military intelligence subsequently found itself guilty of, forever dominated Cabell\'s  thinking.  Apparently by noon on that Friday, someone at ATIC found himself in a heated telephone conversation with Cabell. After receiving a yard long Teletype message from AFOIN later that afternoon, right at ATIC\'s 4:00 P.M. closing time, Analysis personnel knew they had to act. Colonel S.H. Kirkland Jr. was then moving up the ladder at ATIC and working with Colonel Watson\'s good buddy Moose Deyarmond, they secured orders (via the administrative ATIN office with a WD form 67) for Lieutenant Colonel Rosengarten to go to New Jersey. Rosengarten was to oversee an investigation of the case in time for a scheduled late Monday afternoon Pentagon conference on the matter with Cabell himself! It is of interest, however, that they told Lt. Col. Rosengarten to hold off on giving the General any definite analysis until all the facts of the case could be studied. (Keep in mind, this is already 18 days after the sighting took place.)  Because Lt. Col. Rosengarten was head of the Performance and Characteristics Branch under the Aircraft and Propulsion Section within ATIC\'s Analysis Division, he technically had the old Grudge project under his many commands. Lt. Col. Rosengarten always devoted a hundred percent effort to every task he was given and also sought to carry out assignments in a thorough and careful manner. So he took some time to consider seeking assistance on this important task. As he looked out from his office down the length of Analysis\' long hut-like home, he saw many desks lined up. At one of them he noticed Ed Ruppelt. Ruppelt occupied the exact same desk left by Alfred Loedding who, ironically, left ATIC eight months earlier for a job in Pennsylvania the very day Ruppelt arrived. Since then, Ruppelt had been recruited on occasion to assist with UFO assignments.  Yet logically, only one man should have the task because he was responsible for running Grudge. Lt. Col. Rosengarten\'s keen eye moved onto that man, good old Jerry Cummings. Cummings had only recently come to Grudge and like Ruppelt had been reactivated with the start of hostilities in Korea late in 1950. Although recently discovered files do reveal that Cummings did have an earlier tour at the old T-2 Intelligence group in Dayton during the tail end of World War Two. So he was obviously a capable man with prior experience in technical intelligence and apparently a highly skilled Cal. Tec. trained aeronautical engineer.  Rosengarten\'s opinion of Cummings was very high. It is evident from the UFO files released by the National Archives that a more serious approach was taken as soon as he took over what was left of the Grudge operation back in July. Cummings, however, often faced many hurdles. In fact, Cummings had been very put out when Feiling bypassed his office with the Fort Monmouth reports. He had complained about this to Deyarmond and to Lt. Col. Rosengarten. So now Rosengarten was giving him the chance to do his job.  Cummings was going too.  Although a few researchers have simply characterized Rosengarten and Cummings as doing damage control for ATIC, both men appeared eager to conduct a detailed and objective investigation. Admittedly, there are mysteries from those critical three days, spanning Friday, September 28 to Monday, October 1, but it is clear they were on a mission for Cabell which even had an ""Operational Immediate"" designation to it. Operational Immediate was the highest peacetime priority code issued at that time and this one had come direct from the old man himself! (It should be noted however that during our interview with Colonel Rosengarten in 1999, he told us that he only made the trip in person to ensure that Cummings received full cooperation.)  Their trip began after boarding a TWA commercial airliner late that Friday night at 11:30 P.M. EST. Rosengarten and Cummings flew direct to New York. The next morning they traveled to New Jersey and coordinated with the G-2 Signal Corps radar station at Fort Monmouth. While at Fort Monmouth they received excellent cooperation from the personnel at the radar station who were all very helpful to their investigation. Lt. Col. Rosengarten recorded:  Interrogation of the student [radar] personnel occupied Saturday, Saturday night, and Sunday morning and part of Sunday afternoon. Much time was spent attempting to fix with greater detail dates, time, and circumstances in order to find something of value.  . . . Then, the two pilots, Major Ballard flying as observer, and Lt. Rogers who was flying as pilot of a T-33, sighted an unidentified flying object and they flew into Fort Monmouth for interrogation. Cummings and Rosengarten were truly working around the clock because early into Monday morning Lt. Col. Rosengarten sent an R and R (routing and record sheet) wire message to the Office of Special Investigation. This 3:30 A.M. R&R; or special transmission officially requested follow-up assistance from the 2nd District AFOSI office on Broad Street in New York City. The AFOSI, in fact, routinely assisted with UFO investigations. Although in this case it seems Rosengarten initiated the AFOSI investigation himself, with authority from the commanding general at the Fort Monmouth radar base. For some reason, however, Ruppelt recalled that this created a ""famous hassle"" at ATIC. Following is Lt. Col. Rosengarten\'s 3:30 A.M. Monday morning message to the NY AFOSI that caused such a stir:  FROM NR ROSENGARTEN LT COL AFOIN-ATIAA-2 WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB AUTH BY CG FT MONMOUTH NJ. IT IS REQUESTED THAT OSI CONDUCT A DETAILED CHECK IMMEDIATELY AS TO HOW MAJOR BARRON RECEIVED INFORMATION CMA UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES 2 MEMBERS OF THE PRESS WERE GIVEN THIS INFORMATION OF THE INCIDENT PRIOR TO CONTACTING BARRON. DESIRE NAMES AND TIME OF OTHER MEMBERS OF PRESS INFORMED OF INCIDENT. IT IS DESIRABLE THAT EXACT TIME OF EACH CONVERSATION BE VERIFIED, WHERE APPROXIMATE, INDICATE. THIS INFORMATION IS URGENT AS PER COMMAND OF GENERAL CABELL AIR TECH INT WASHINGTON DC AND IS REQUIRED PRIOR TO 0800 1ST OF OCT AT FORT MONMOUTH ATTN LT. COL NR ROSENGARTEN CMA AIR TECH INTELLIGENCE HQ USAF OR BY 1200 1ST OCT AT AFOIN TC TO BE HELD FOR LT COL ROSENGARTEN. Earlier at 9:05 P.M. Sunday night, Lt. Col. Rosengarten had phoned the New York AFOSI and informed them of his oncoming wire. Then he again talked by phone to AFOSI duty officer Lieutenant Michael O. Pettee around the time of the 3:30 A.M. wire. Rosengarten told him that Mitchel AFB PIO Major Barron had no malicious intent when he allowed the pilots to talk to the press, but that the release of information in principle did violate regulations. He also feared a security breach had occurred despite Barron\'s best intended efforts as this AFOSI internal memo demonstrates:  Lt. Colonel Rosengarten, AFOIN-ATIAA-2, is assigned to the Director of Intelligence, Headquarters USAF, with duty at Wright-Patterson AFB, in Technical Intelligence. He dispatched the wire referred to in the R&R; from Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey, indicating that the information released carried the classification of Secret. He also stated in the wire that the inquiry had been personally and urgently requested by Major General Cabell, Director of Intelligence, Headquarters USAF, and that it was mandatory, if at all possible, to have the results of the interview available at AFOIN-TC, 1 October 1951, during which Rosengarten would be in conference with General Cabell and other personnel of the Technical Capabilities Branch, of OIN. The significance, if any, of this activity is unknown to OSI. Full information has been requested and has been promised by Major Parker, OIN, for 2 October 1951. I also pointed out verbally to OIN the irregular manner in which the request was made to OSI. Lucius L. Free, Lt. Col., USAF Sabotage and Espionage Branch. The AFOSI certainly worked fast. By 11:00 A.M. that Monday morning AFOSI Detachment Commander Major Paul L. McCoy had made a synopsis of the case. By 11:45 A.M. Lt. Col. Rosengarten was informed of the results of their speedy interview of Major Barron. McCoy then said he would forward any additional findings to the Pentagon in time for Rosengarten\'s 4:00 P.M. deadline with Major General Cabell.  In 1999, Colonel Rosengarten told the authors that leaks to the news media did indeed have the potential to cause unnecessary harm. Other primary sources have confirmed what will be documented later in this story, that there were key people in the Pentagon and Intelligence community who believed that one good tale about a ""flying saucer"" in a large newspaper could cause many people around the country to start looking for UFOs. Because most average citizens are not accustomed to closely observing the sky, they in turn will see things that are in many cases natural or man-made phenomena of which they themselves have no understanding. In theory, this would then lead to a flood of other UFO reports which would cause a great deal of extra work for the Air Force. It would take men like Ed Ruppelt off analysis work on Soviet aircraft and send him chasing all over the country interviewing UFO witnesses. This scenario would also hamper sincere efforts by ATIC to study the phenomenon. But most importantly, the main point is that public hysteria over UFOs could cause other units of the military to be overwhelmed with the issue and perhaps even hamper their ability to respond to a more earthly Cold War threat, the Cold War being the much more important concern of the day. Although such a scenario would later be championed by the CIA, it was one growing Air Force concern even at this time, whether the theory itself was valid or not. Thus, those at ATIC like Ed Ruppelt, despite what they felt personally, had to respect this attitude. Former ATIC veterans stated that this was simply respect for duty.  Even with such concerns, UFOs received attention by the Air Force. Any object in the sky of an unknown origin has been of interest to units like ATIC since the 1946 ""ghost rocket"" reports over Europe. Today, successor organizations are still just as worried about objects that cannot be identified. But, there are ""UFOs"" and then there are ""flying saucers."" Some like Colonel Watson and Major Boggs wanted to keep tabs on any UFOs associated with the USSR. But ""men from Mars"" did not openly seem to figure into their concerns even though others like Major General Cabell may have been more broad minded. Cabell, at least, became specifically concerned with the broad issue of flying saucers. So if there is any moral for this brief side bar to our story, it is that UFO projects after Sign had to first be focused on public reaction to UFOs. That is what Grudge became during Colonel Watson\'s reign. Grudge\'s successor, Blue Book, under Ruppelt\'s tenure would seek a more multi-dimensional role by 1952 but still had to keep in mind the Pentagon\'s desire to discourage the media from generating undue public concern.  Now to return to our story of the Fort Monmouth case, late into Sunday night the 30th and even on Monday morning of October 1, Cummings and Rosengarten worked to finish their investigation in time to meet Cabell\'s 4:00 P.M. Monday deadline for the all important Pentagon meeting. Neither man had had much sleep or food since they began their journey, but at least by Monday morning they felt they had done justice to their mission. At the last minute, however, they realized they couldn\'t even get a Signal Corps aircraft off the ground in time to make Washington by 4:00.  So, at Lt. Col. Rosengarten\'s initiative, he chartered a private plane to fly them to Washington. When they reached the Pentagon they briefed the General but soon found themselves participating in a briefing with not just Cabell, but other top AFOIN brass. (This meeting may have not occurred until the next morning at 10:00 A.M.)  Ruppelt\'s book provides a provocative description of that top secret meeting. Because of the significance of the passage it deserves to be quoted in full exactly as stated by Edward Ruppelt:  [Major] General Cabell presided over the meeting, and it was attended by his entire staff plus Lieutenant Cummings, Lieutenant Colonel Rosengarten, and a special representative from Republic Aircraft Corporation. The man from Republic supposedly represented a group of top U.S. industrialists and scientists who thought that there should be a lot more sensible answers coming from the Air Force regarding the UFOs. The man was at the meeting at the personal request of a general officer. Every word of the two-hour meeting was recorded on a wire recorder. The recording was so hot that it was later destroyed, but not before I had heard it several times. I can\'t tell everything that was said but, to be conservative, it didn\'t exactly follow the tone of the official Air Force releases, many of the people present at the meeting weren\'t as convinced that the \'hoax, hallucination, and misidentification\' answer was quite as positive as the Grudge Report and subsequent press releases made out. Toward the end of the two-hour conference a general asked Lieutenant Cummings to review the activity of the UFO investigation for the past year and a half. Maybe it was just a lack of sleep, or maybe it was just Cummings, but the general got the straight answer, for all practical purposes the project was dead. Then Cummings proceeded to elaborate on the details, the attitude at ATIC, the opposition to his reorganizing the project, and the methods of processing reports. Lieutenant Cummings didn\'t miss a point. He later told me that all of the generals and about three fourths of the full colonels present at the meeting turned the shade of purple normally associated with rage while a sort of sickly grin graced the faces of the remaining few. Then one of the generals on the purple-faced team glared at the sickly-grin team and cut loose. The first thing the general wanted to know was, \'Who in the hell has been giving me these reports that every decent flying saucer sighting is being investigated?\' Then others picked up the questioning. \'What happened to those two reports that General __ sent in from Saudi Arabia? He saw those two flying saucers himself.\' [That case actually occurred after this meeting took place during the next year of 1952 to a General E.M. Day, apparently the case that was so discussed at that meeting was the Mantell Incident. Because Ruppelt made such an effective argument in his book that the Mantell Incident was not UFO related, he probably substituted the Saudi Arabia sighting so as not to bring the issue of Mantell up again.] \'And who released this big report, anyway?\' another person [we now know this was Major General Cabell] added, picking up a copy of the Grudge Report and slamming it back down on the table. We understand that during the meeting Cummings told Cabell all he knew about the behind -the-scenes influences on Project Grudge. Yet, research cannot completely pin down Lt. Col. Rosengarten\'s own view. In 1999 Colonel Rosengarten simply told the authors that he just leaned back and let Cummings go.  Lt. Col. Rosengarten did not necessarily disagree with him but would not have characterized the situation in that manner nor have the discourtesy to reprimand Cummings in front of his own superiors. He knew Cummings had no intention himself of making a career out of the military. Besides, Rosengarten said everybody loved that guy if for no other reason than he was so bright.  Ruppelt simply wrote that about that time in the meeting, \'Cummings dropped his horn rimmed glasses down on his nose, tipped his head forward, peered at Major General Cabell over his glasses and acting not at all like a first lieutenant, said that the UFO investigation was all fouled up.\'  Through personal conversations with Colonel Rosengarten, the authors learned of his high regard for not only Cummings but Colonel Watson, and Watson\'s administration of ATIC. These authors also greatly respect Colonel Watson\'s service but do not understand his apparently skeptical attitude toward UFOs and why ATIC sought to focus only on the public relations issues under his command. Colonel Watson was, in fact, an outstanding officer, no one ever stated anything to the contrary.  In his early career he had been a highly technically trained \'engine man.\' Since earning his bachelor\'s degree in electrical engineering in 1933 and completing some more course work at Yale, Watson proved himself a valued research engineer for Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company. By 1936, however, he decided to join the Army Air Corps. Watson wanted to learn to fly.  He did become a flying cadet and soon came under the experienced wing of none other than Lieutenant Curtis LeMay, strategic bombing visionary and future Air Force Chief of Staff. Watson excelled in flying school as he did in every endeavor in life but due to what was considered a mature age of 25 and an unusually high technical expertise, he was destined for desk work. So in June of 1937 he began a tour at Langley Field as an Engineering Officer. Although not one to be detoured from his passions, he learned to fly almost every aircraft in the inventory despite his assigned duties.  In 1939, while beginning the first of five tours at Dayton, 1st Lieutenant Watson went to work in the Wright Labs Power Plant Division, specializing in engine quality and production liaison with major manufacturers for the Air Force. It was around this time that Watson and Red Honaker became such close friends. Honaker was a clerk at the flight desk in those days and always gave Watson the word when a hot new aircraft came into the field, Watson still being eager to log flight time on his weekends off.  By the time America entered the war, Lieutenant Watson was working to complete his masters degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Michigan. This was quite an opportunity as only three people from Wright Labs were picked for this advanced course work. After graduation, Captain Watson returned to being a valuable trouble shooter in engine quality control and even testified before Senator Harry S Truman\'s oversight committee as an expert in aircraft power plant production.  Moving from captain to major in one month, he became a key Army liaison with the Wright-Aero factory in Cincinnati, Ohio. During the latter part of the war Lieutenant Colonel Watson distinguished himself as Director of Maintenance for the 1st Tactical Air Force in an overseas assignment in England. His work impressed General Hap Arnold, Commanding General of the Army Air Forces. But it was Commanding General of U.S. Strategic Air Forces, General \'Tooey\' Spaatz, who picked him for the assignment he is most known for. Spaatz put him in charge of Operation Lusty‹an endeavor to recover German aircraft technology. The small group of ace test pilots and master mechanics Watson led around Europe at the end of the war became known as Watson\'s \'Whizzers.\' They all had great admiration for their commander, by then a full Colonel.  While in this assignment, Watson finally got to do some \'official\' test flying. Of course, in actuality, he had always managed to fly the latest new aircraft, working out mechanical problems. Until this point, however, Watson had never been rated as a test pilot. As head of Operation Lusty he had the chance to make that grade while flying many new high performance German designs such as the Messerschmitt 262 jet fighter.  The assignment certainly fit Watson\'s flamboyant personality and called on his widely varied talents, but it was indeed dangerous work. On one adventure Watson almost lost his life when a German saboteur attached an explosive device to a Junkers-290 transport that he and his men were returning home on via a bold Atlantic crossing. When the fearless Watson landed in this huge aircraft, the bomb was discovered under the main fuel tank and luckily disarmed without incident. For his many exploits during Project Lusty, Colonel Watson received the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal.  As an interesting side note, many individuals who were involved in other projects to recover German technology during the war (like Albert Deyarmond, Howard McCoy, Miles Goll, Malcolm Seashore, Donald Putt, and John O\'Mara) ended up working with Watson over the years. Virtually anyone who had the honor to serve with or under Watson spoke of him highly. The authors also stress that they have the highest respect for Harold Watson. His biography by Air Force historian Bruce Ashcroft even begins with a statement that he \'was the type of person who would roll up his shirt sleeves and work side-by-side with his people.\'  He was a fine officer, but what accounts for his skeptical behavior in regard to UFOs, or perhaps we should say flying saucers? Why did he seem to have such little patience or interest associated with UFO investigations?  Perhaps he gained unique insights on the phenomenon during his third tour at Wright Field as head of the Collections Division for T-2 in 1945 and 1946. Or during a tour at the Industrial College and then the Pentagon in 1947 to 1949, when he learned something modern researchers do not understand. Maybe he was quoted by Ruppelt as saying \'flying saucers are a bunch of nonsense\' because he knew the reports to be unreliable. These authors are willing to appreciate that there are other insights, and  certainly Colonel Watson was in a position to have a first hand perspective.  However, one source suggested to the authors that Watson may have actually believed in \'flying saucers\' and certainly Cabell did. Although, this is not to imply that they believed in an extraterrestrial origin per se but the reality of a phenomenon or a whole set of phenomena. Watson did apparently come to loggerheads with Cabell but not over belief in UFOs.  They both knew there was something unexplainable. It was all over their approach. Watson wanted to deal with flying saucers by discouraging investigation into them and making it an unpopular issue in the press. In short, the disc reports were just so unexplainable that he wanted to ignore them to concentrate on Cold War issues.  Major General Cabell, on the other hand, desired investigation, as good an investigation as ATIC\'s budget would allow, but wanted the press controlled with tact, not ridiculed. Both men also clearly worried about the UFO issue hampering the military\'s effectiveness, as has already been detailed.  To back this up, an anonymous source stressed to the authors that the public\'s impression in the 1950s was that the primary job of the Air Force was supposed to be air defense. Although numerous other high ranking officers may have also believed in flying saucers \'as a phenomenon,\' they did not want this known. They worried that if it became common knowledge the public might lose confidence in the Air Force\'s ability to defend America\'s skies.  Along with this thought, many in the Air Force sincerely worried about creating a state of panic as was believed to have been demonstrated by Orson Welles\' well-known 1938 Halloween radio drama. On that famous night the dramatic actor Orson Welles produced and narrated a play based on H.G. Wells\' book, The War of the Worlds. Like the classic account of a Martian invasion, the radio show was a frightening success. Unfortunately for many East Coast listeners, it seemed so real that some were claimed to have flown into a panicked frenzy, actually believing aliens were landing in Grovers Mill, New Jersey. Apparently, a few suicides actually occurred as a result.  A portion of Ruppelt\'s early unedited manuscript to The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects discusses the Orson Welles\' broadcast. Ruppelt states that his office was even ordered to investigate the so-called panic and present a report on it.  While concern over that 1938 incident may sound ridiculous today, these authors have proof it was a very real mind-set of Pentagon and government officials from that time. Of course the clear implication here is that in order for those same officials to subscribe to such a theory, they must have believed that the discs were extraterrestrial in origin! Our source did not know if Cabell or Watson\'s views went that far but did suggest to us that they were believers. Ruppelt\'s personal papers also characterize Cabell as \'pretty much a believer in the UFOs.\'  In regard to this famous Pentagon meeting, however, Colonel Rosengarten recently told the authors that contrary to Ruppelt\'s account, it was mostly low key with nowhere near the number of participants described. But as stated, he fondly and respectfully remembers Cummings going on about Grudge and making quite an impression.  Colonel Rosengarten said with affection, \'that boy could talk a starved dog off of a bloody meat wagon, he was so persuasive.\' Colonel Rosengarten also has a very clear memory of Major General Cabell. Near the end of the conference Cabell apparently did get worked up, taking the Grudge report and driving it into the table.  But Colonel Rosengarten states that Cabell, also unlike in Ruppelt\'s account, was not angry with ATIC in general, just all the press coverage of UFOs. His point here is that Cabell wanted to prevent the media from focusing too much public attention on the subject until the Air Force had a fair chance to investigate the phenomenon.  Cabell, in fact, challenged ATIC to prove that UFOs did exist! In other words, Cabell thought that trying to prove a negative assumption was a futile exercise in any sort of Intelligence endeavor. Colonel Rosengarten also stated that Cabell was a very fine officer and treated both him and Cummings with great respect and attention. Never at any time in Colonel Rosengarten\'s memory of that meeting did the General express doubts in ATIC\'s ability to face the challenges associated with UFOs under the new leadership of Col. Dunn.  Now before we stop there, the authors have just recently uncovered still a third version of this landmark Pentagon meeting. We have read what Ruppelt wrote in the pages of his popular book and studied what Colonel Rosengarten recalls. Yet, here is something from Ruppelt\'s private papers that is straight from the mouth of Jerry Cummings.  The passage originated from a conversation Ruppelt had with Jerry Cummings on January 14, 1955, when Ruppelt was compiling his manuscript. Surprisingly, it seems to suggest Colonel Watson may still have been at ATIC as late as the end of September or at least around that general time frame. We thank Professor Michael Swords for sharing this very important document from his files:  [Edward Ruppelt writes:] On 14 January 1955, I had lunch with Jerry Cummings who was then working for Radioplane Corporation in Van Nuys. Since Jerry had been in charge of Blue Book in September 1951, he had the story on how the project got a shot of added emphasis from the sightings at Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey. (Jerry got out of the Air Force shortly after this and went back to work at Cal Tec.) Jerry said that on the afternoon of September 1951 [no exact date given but his story apparently begins in mid month] he was in the office when he got a call from Lt. Col. Rosengarten, who was chief of the Aircraft and Propulsion Section at ATIC. [sic, Performance and Characteristics Branch of the Aircraft and Propulsion Section.] Rosy [sic, his nickname was spelled Rosie] was out [sic] boss. Rosy had a wire that had come in from Ft. Monmouth telling about the sightings there of the past few days. The wire was about 4\' long and very detailed. It was obvious from the tone of the wire that it had created quite a stir at Ft. Monmouth. When the wire had come into Feiling\'s office (Col. Bruno[w] Feiling, Chief of the Analysis Division) about 1300 he had sent it on to Capt Roy James in the Electronics Branch since the sighting involved radar. Somehow Jim [James] Rodgers, ex-chief of Blue Book (at the time it was Grudge and there is no evidence Roy James ever headed Grudge) had gotten into the act. Rodgers and [Roy] James were laughing about the whole thing when Cummings first heard about it. He was a bit hacked because he was supposed to have the Project but there was nothing that he could do. The reason for the interest by Rodgers and James, supposedly the first team, was that there had been a rumble that someone in Washington was interested and a quick answer was needed. Cummings was \'too slow.\' After they messed around with the report for awhile, [the ATIC records show a number of days] speculating on what they could use for an answer, Rosy had gotten wind of the report and he went into Feiling\'s office to complain that if he was responsible for the UFO reports he should be the first one to get them. Rodgers was called in and he gave the report to Rosy. Rodgers already had an answer, \'the whole outfit were a bunch of young impressionable kids and the T-33 crew had seen a reflection.\' Rodgers had supposedly reported these findings to Col. Watson, the Chief of ATIC, and Watson had supposedly bought the idea. Rosy didn\'t like this answer and Cummings like[d] it less, when he saw the wire in Rosy\'s office. They decided not to call in James again because neither one of them trusted his judgment. Cummings was just getting ready to go over to Wright Field to get someone from the Radiation Lab to take a look at the report when a wire came in from Washington. [Apparently now Cummings is referring to Friday, September 28th.] The time was now about 1600. The wire indicated that [Major] General Cabell had seen a copy of the wire from Ft. Monmouth [heard of it via the news leak on the sighting] and that he wanted to know what ATIC thought. Rodgers put the pressure on to send his answer back to the Pentagon and \'get them off our backs.\' He claimed that Watson was in agreement with him. [Ruppelt adds here:] (Possible Watson wasn\'t there. If Watson wasn\'t there it was Dunn, but this doesn\'t sound like Dunn. Jerry kept saying Watson.) Both Rosy and Cummings were against this and when it looked as if Rodgers might be going to win out when someone (I didn\'t get who) called the Pentagon and talked to Gen Cabell\'s assistant, a colonel [John Schweizer]. This colonel was very surprised to hear that there was even any question at all as to whether or not anyone would go out and investigate the report so whoever it was from ATIC that was on the phone weaseled around to make it sound as if they were going to go to Monmouth and had planned to do it all of the time. [This may have been Albert Deyarmond.] The Colonel, Cabell\'s assistant, added that the General had said that he wanted this report fully investigated and that if they weren\'t getting the proper cooperation they should call him or the General and get him out of bed, if necessary. With this it was decided that a trip should be made and Rosy and Cummings got a hurried set of orders [we now know from Cabell himself but approved by the new ATIC Analysis chief by the 28th, Colonel S.H. Kirkland] and were on their way. When they got to New Jersey [on the 29th] they called the Pentagon and found Cabell had left word that he was to be briefed at the earliest possible moment. The General said that he wanted to be briefed on Monday (??) [October 1] at the latest. [It seems this order for a prompt investigation and a follow-up Pentagon meeting on Monday October 1st was already part of the Operational Immediate message received by ATIC on September 28th which initiated the whole trip.] When they got to Monmouth, Cummings and Rosy got in touch with the OD and the OD got them transportation. The Signal Corps was very cooperative. They talked to all concerned and got their story. [This is all confirmed by Colonel Rosengarten.] The pilot and passenger of the T-33 flew up to Mitchel (??) [the next day, Sunday September 29th] and Rosy and Cummings went over there to talk to them [and was still working with them on Monday morning the 1st of October]. They [the pilots] were both completely sold that the UFO was real. They didn\'t have any idea what it was but they were convinced that it was something \'intelligently controlled.\' [Ruppelt\'s reflections again:] (It is interesting to note that weeks later, when we proved, at least to my satisfaction, that the UFO was a balloon, the two officers said that we were nuts.  They found several holes in our analysis.) [Colonel Rosengarten confirmed this to the authors. He said, \'those pilots would have reached out and slugged us when we interviewed them if we suggested that the facts which we were uncovering actually indicated a balloon as the culprit.\'] Rosy and Jerry found out that the press had gotten a hold of the story and they didn\'t like it one bit. At this time the UFO project was a fairly well guarded secret for two reasons: (1) Many people believed that these UFO\'s were from outer space and they didn\'t want to cause any alarm, and (2) the other faction, led by Watson, and obediently followed by Rodgers and James, believed that if you stuck your head deep enough into the sand that they would go away. [Interviews with Colonel Rosengarten indicate that radar expert Roy James was not as skeptical of UFOs as he was doubtful of the capabilities of the primitive state of current radar technology at that time.] [Ruppelt continued reporting:] In addition, Watson had been telling the reporters that the Project was dead. Cabell read this, evidently, but he was for keeping it all quiet and thought that this story from ATIC was just a cover-up. The story had leaked out when the T-33 crew talked to the tower and when they had inadvertently talked to each other on the VHF instead of the intercom. Later on they were talking in a bar and a reporter [Dick Aurelio] overheard them. Both of these bits of intelligence were put together and the local story evolved [via the good intentioned help of the PIO, Major John B. Barron, at Mitchel AFB]. Cummings somewhere got word that the ADC radar site at or near Sandy Hook had been picking up targets at the same time as the activity was going on at Monmouth so he went to [the] site to try to find out what was going on. He got a very cold reception and had to call the Duty Officer at D/I to get into the place. When he did he found out that things were all fouled up. The radar logs showed unidentified targets but the officer said that they were SAC aircraft on a classified training mission. The log didn\'t show this however. Jerry did think that he established that the radar had no target other than the T-33 at the time of the sighting. When Rosy and Cummings finished they couldn\'t get a flight to Washington so they again called the Pentagon to see if they could get an aircraft to come up after them. They didn\'t have aircraft that intelligence could get so the Pentagon said to charter a plane. This they did [with the help of Lt. Col. Rosengarten\'s own initiative]. When they got to Washington they cleaned up and went out to the Pentagon and Gen. Cabell had a meeting set up. There were several people from the aircraft industry at the meeting. How they had found out about the meeting, Jerry didn\'t know. One of the men was a Mr. Brewster from Republic Aircraft. The whole meeting was recorded on wire but several weeks later, at ATIC, at the direction of either Col. Watson or Deyarmond, the wire was destroyed. I heard it before it was destroyed, however. The meeting was a rough one. While Jerry and Rosy were in New Jersey the General had done a little bit of checking. He had called ATIC and talked to Rodgers and it was obvious that Rodgers didn\'t have the answers that the General thought he should have. He got a good clue that Project Grudge had been scuttled a long time before. When the briefing was rolling the General asked Jerry to give a resume of what had been taking place on Project Grudge. Jerry told me that he looked at Rosy and got the OK sign, so he cut loose [Colonel Rosengarten did not confirm this to the authors]. He told how every report was taken as a huge joke; that at the personal direction of Watson, Rodgers, Watson\'s #1 stooge, was doing everything to degrade the quality of the reports; and how the only analysis consisted of Rodger\'s trying to think up new and original explanations that hadn\'t been sent to Washington before. Rodgers couldn\'t even find half of the reports. The General then got on his horse. He said, I want an open mind, in fact, I order an open mind. Anyone that doesn\'t keep an open mind can get out, now. As long as there is any element of doubt, the Project will continue. About this time one of the General\'s staff suggested that since there were industry observers present, maybe the remarks should be kept objective or that the industry people chouls [sic] leave. This got the Old Man and he said that he didn\'t care how embarrassing it was, he wasn\'t ashamed to give people the devil in front of strangers. [Colonel Rosengarten does not remember any representatives of private industry being present at the meeting.] He said that the apparent disregard of his orders were a source of concern. He complimented Cummings and Rosy by saying that he was glad to \'Get action.\' [This point is confirmed by our interview with Colonel Rosengarten.] The General asked about the results of the investigations of several other good sightings but a telephone check to ATIC showed that they had been lost, no one ever could find them. [These may refer to some records which other sources confirm were destroyed at ATIC either in late 1950 and/or represented records from late 1950 which were destroyed about that general time.] His next question was: \'Why do I have to stir up the action? Anyone can see that we do not have a satisfactory answer to the saucer question.\' Cabell went on to say that he wanted some action. He wanted the Project reorganized and he wanted all of the directives reissued because, he said, it was obvious that they were not being followed. Then, Jerry told me, the General looked at his staff of colonels for about 45 seconds and said, \'I\'ve been lied to, and lied to, and lied to, and lied to. I want it to stop. I want the answer to the saucers and I want a good answer.\' [Colonel Rosengarten respectfully maintains that Cabell\'s blowup at that meeting was not over ATIC\'s failure to investigate but the press leaks surrounding the T-33 sighting. The reasoning he gives is that Cabell did believe there was certainly something to the flying saucers and for that reason he wanted to keep it all as quiet as possible until they found the answer. Again, the 1938 War of the Worlds broadcast is alluded to in this context as an example of the mind-set/concerns expressed at that meeting. He says he never heard of J.J. or E.H. Porter, Aaron Jerry Boggs, William Adams, Weldon Smith, or others that modern day researchers speculate may have been associated with that meeting.] He started in on the Mantell Sightings and said that he had never heard such a collection of contradictory and indefinite statements. He said that he thought that he had a big activity operating and found out the only man, and apparently incompetent one at that, fumbling around trying to make excuses. Col. Porter [Ruppelt words:] (whom I considered to be one of the most totally incompetent men in the Air Force for reasons other than the UFO Project) was his old stupid self and said that he still thought that the project was a waste of time. The General\'s reply was that he didn\'t consider himself a crackpot or impressionable person and that he had a great deal of doubt in his mind that the saucers were all \'hoaxes, hallucinations or the misinterpretation of known objects.\' He took a swing at the famous Grudge Report by saying that it was the \'most poorly written, unconclusive piece of unscientific tripe\' that he\'d ever seen. The General ended up the meeting by giving a pep talk and saying that he thought that things would change and that the saucers would become respective [sic]. He said that he was going to keep an open mind and that he wanted the same from his staff. [This is confirmed by Cabell\'s own autobiography.] Cummings and Rosy came back to ATIC but the battle wasn\'t over. Watson hadn\'t been at the meeting, he had sent Col Dunn. Watson didn\'t openly fight the Project but he drug his feet for all he was worth. It wasn\'t until Watson went to Europe that the Project began to pick up. [The exact date of Watson\'s departure for  Europe has still not been conclusively ascertained by any Air Force documents.] It is known via a letter dated October 5 from the Inspector General\'s office that after the Pentagon meeting concluded, Cabell no longer felt a security violation had occurred but that the sightings were of significant interest. (Around this time Cabell even requested a review of German secret weapons technology, a link to flying saucers that the first investigators like Alfred Loedding tried but failed to establish four years prior.)  A final report mentioned in that letter was to be drafted by AFOIN but has never surfaced. Cabell did soon send word down to reactivate or create a new Project Grudge, hereafter referred to as New Grudge. Colonel Dunn was instructed to give greater attention to the  persistent flying saucer problem as he assumed his new duties as ATIC commander. (Around the time of the Pentagon meeting Col. Watson had already been \'relieved\'  and was getting ready for reassignment to General Lauris Norstaadt\'s command in Europe.)  Also on his way out was the chief of Analysis at ATIC, Colonel Brunow Feiling, replaced by the up and coming and more objective Colonel Kirkland, who was already in place at ATIC by late September.  Colonel E.H. Porter\'s assistant and Pentagon liaison to ATIC, arch saucer-killer Jerry Boggs, was out too, being temporarily replaced by Lieutenant M.D. Willis before Major Dewey Fournet took his position. Fournet would, in contrast to Boggs, adopt an eventual very pro-saucer approach.  Nevertheless, Colonel Porter remained as Deputy Director for Estimates. He was apparently one of those officers at the Pentagon meeting with a sickly grin on his face when Cabell blew his top. But UFO friendly individuals working under Porter such as Colonel William A. Adams and  Colonel Weldon Smith would soon have a significant impact on establishing a more open-minded approach. (Smith worked under Adams who eventually became Chief of the Topical Intelligence Division for the Deputy Director for Estimates at the Directorate of Intelligence, AFOIN. Although at the time Adams was Deputy of the Evaluation Division known as AFOIN-2B3.)  So whether it was by design or chance, men with much more open minds when it came to the UFO phenomenon assumed key positions in both Dayton and Washington. Although at WPAFB, as urgent as Cabell\'s orders appeared, no one really seemed to want the added duty. Dunn proceeded to put all the responsibility on Rosengarten who then put it on Cummings, but Cummings soon left the Air Force around mid November to return to work deemed of importance at the California Institute of Technology. So, the task went back up to Lt. Col. Rosengarten. He passed it on to Lieutenant Ruppelt and Lieutenant Henry Metscher who had both already worked with Cummings.  During our interview with Colonel Rosengarten, he stressed that one has to realize that the war in Korea and the Cold War in general occupied great amounts of energy. UFOs certainly were supposed to get better attention, but they were still but a part of the big picture. Colonel Rosengarten added that ATIC was backlogged with many types of analysis chores dating back to the end of WWII as well as new and urgent work on Soviet aircraft. All of this took a huge portion of AMC/ATIC\'s human and financial resources. A recently declassified 1951 history of ATIC shows just how busy they really were with Cold War matters. For example, the Analysis Division, with only 37 technically trained military personnel, had 31 separate projects underway  just in the Aircraft and Propulsion Section alone. One of these was titled Project 10124, a study of Soviet aircraft power-plant development. Project 10095 analyzed foreign aircraft fuels and lubricants. Project 10118 evaluated German swept-forward wing bombers that had been developed by the Junkers group of engineers commandeered by the Russians at the end of the war. It also studied Soviet delta-wing designs. One of the highest priority projects in the Analysis Division concerned estimating Russian bomber developments. This was of such high priority because real fears then existed over a Soviet nuclear strike against the United States by long-range heavy bombers. Project 10102 dealt with that concern which in 1951 acquired aerial photographs of the Type-27 Soviet multi-purpose bomber. These photographs were sent to the Analysis Division\'s Aircraft and Propulsion Section. They then may have directly come under Lt. Col. Rosengarten\'s attention as head of the Performance and Characteristics Branch.  Another effort only recently declassified, concerned a Hungarian-operated Soviet Yak-11 trainer which crashed landed in Siegenburg, Germany. This became the basis of Project 10098 and focused on a careful examination of the aircraft after it was delivered to ATIC in November of  1951.  Project 10115, which Ruppelt had assisted with, analyzed the Mig-15. At the time the Mig-15 generated great concern because it was close in performance to our best fighter aircraft. In July of 1951, ATIC was lucky enough to receive a crashed Mig-15, although it was very badly damaged. The most startling discovery from this project was that the engine used in the Mig-15 was an exact copy of the British Rolls-Royce Nene engine. ATIC forwarded this engine to the Pratt & Whitney Division of United Aircraft Corporation for detailed evaluation and sent the airframe to Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory for evaluation under a contract with them.  The UFO project was designated 10073. A section from the ATIC history dealing with Project 10073 obviously was not written until very late in 1951, after Ruppelt reorganized the effort. It states the following:  This project involves the collection of reports of unidentified aerial objects; the evaluation, as to source and content, of reports of visual or electronic sightings of unidentified aerial objects submitted by military or civilian sources; the investigation of reports of such sightings through field work when deemed necessary; and the preparation of periodic status reports for the information of the D/I, Hq USAF. This investigation has been in progress for approximately four years and a new increase in activity has been initiated in studying and indexing project records to enable a statistical survey of incidents to be accomplished. It is contemplated that all of the sightings of unconventional flying objects will be cross-indexed according to size, color, location, etc., so that as much statistical data as possible will be available. It is believed that possibly several general characteristics of the sightings will be determined from the mass of data on file in ATIC. This project concentrated on those incidents that appear to have originated from high grade sources, such as pilots, technically trained people, etc. The exception to this was where a number of sightings occur in a certain area at about the same time. Henry Metscher has also spoken with the authors to help document this time period. Metscher was from the Analysis Division\'s Aircraft and Propulsion Section and specialized in aerodynamic engineering. He recalls that he and Ruppelt were kept extremely busy on all sorts of assignments. During this period they were assisting with UFOs only as part of many duties. By the time New Grudge formally got underway around early December, he had left the Performance and Characteristics Branch. Although he only briefly worked with Ruppelt, Metscher stressed for the record that Ruppelt was \'one of the finest men I ever met.\'  Ruppelt had been a decorated B-29 bombardier and radar operator during WWII with over 1,500 hours in the air. During the war he won five battle  stars, two theater combat ribbons, three Air Medals, the Distinguished Flying Cross with Oak Leaf Clusters, and a Presidential Citation. Ruppelt had gone over with the first B-29 squadron to India as a lead bombardier in the 677th Squadron, 444th Bomb Group, 58th Wing of the 20th Air Force. He remained in the 20th throughout the whole strategic bombing campaign against Japan, following it to Tinian Island from India and China. He even flew on the last conventional raid of the war.  After WWII he became a navigator in the Iowa Air Reserves and entered Iowa State College, earning a BS degree in aeronautical engineering in 1950. With the outbreak of war in Korea, he received a recall to full-time duty from the Air Force and came into Intelligence at Wright- Patterson AFB in early 1951. Given work immediately on classified projects by Lt. Col. Rosengarten, Ruppelt soon gained a reputation at ATIC as a problem solver.  Although he would prove to be the best administrator of a UFO project the Air Force would ever have, he did not have the credentials or rank that would normally be drawn upon for what on the surface seemed a very important intelligence assignment. Only 28 years old at the time, Ruppelt was not a career officer. Still a 1st lieutenant by that fall, it is very odd that any non-career tracked officer would be put in charge of a project as important as one involving possible aerial intrusions into United States air space.---- source: ""Captain Edward J. Ruppelt"" by Michael Hall and Wendy Connors www.nicap.com', '1951, The Fort Monmouth UFO CaseThe Fort Monmouth Case. By Wendy Connors and Mike HallThe Fort Monmouth Case began with a watershed event which took place at 11:18 A.M. EDT on a clear morning in September 1951. It was Monday the 10th. The place was a radar facility near the coastline at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. A young student Army Signal Corps radar operator, PFC Eugent A. Clark, had just picked up an unknown low-flying target moving faster than the automatic setting mode on his AN/MPG-1 radar set could plot.  As a matter of coincidence, a number of visiting Army officers happened to be standing behind Clark at the time, witnessing the strange event unfold. They watched in amazement as in just moments the curious radar blip traversed the coast line at an estimated speed of at least 700 miles per hour. It was lost off the scope near the Sandy Hook coastal peninsula, not far south of New York City.  This radar tracking caused a lot of excitement. In 1951, although jets had reached such speeds in special tests, they flew nowhere near those velocities on a routine or even sustained basis.  Seventeen minutes later, the story became even more bizarre. Just south of Sandy Hook, at 11:35 A.M. EDT, a T-33 jet trainer piloted by Lieutenant Wilbert S. Rogers, with Major Edward Ballard Jr. in the rear seat, encountered a completely unrecognizable object. They were flying northward at 20,000 feet over Point Pleasant, New Jersey headed toward Sandy Hook. At that moment Rogers spotted off to his left a dull, silvery object passing far below on an opposing parallel course. It was southward bound in from the coastline peninsula of Sandy Hook and appeared to be about 12,000 feet below them. Rogers had been on a direct pre-approach heading toward a landing into Mitchel AFB, New York, but wanted Major Ballard to have a look at it. Ballard, however, was on the radio so Rogers turned slightly to the left to linger and waited for him to complete his radio communication. Forty-five seconds later Ballard had caught sight of it, by which time the UFO entered a descending arc-like turn that was about to cut under their flight path. At that moment the pilots\' conversations were heard by ground control via an open mike.  Records show the pilots were excited as both men were watching the object bank. As it did, it revealed a \'discus-like\' silhouette while continuing its turn. So Rogers kept turning left with it to keep it from going under his wing and thus out of view. While the object proceeded to descend further, Rogers nosed his jet down to eventually complete a hair raising 360-degree, 3,000 feet descending maneuver, just to keep it in sight.  Both Rogers and Ballard estimated the craft to be around 30 to 50 feet in diameter and perhaps moving as fast as 700 miles per hour. By then the pilots knew that they were definitely not chasing a balloon because this thing was not only banking left but was by then out-pacing their jet which Rogers had throttled up from 450 to 550 miles per hour! By that point the object had completed a 90 degree turn and was heading away from the coastline, traveling out over the ocean in level flight near the speed of sound at around 5,000 feet. Rogers vainly attempted to parallel its course from his current altitude of 17,000 feet as the UFO continued to increase its speed out to sea, covering 35 miles during the short two minute span of the sighting.  Rogers, an experienced WWII fighter pilot, was later asked by a reporter what he thought it was that they had seen that day. He shrugged and only said that the object was something he had never seen before in his life, and it certainly wasn\'t a balloon because it was not only descending but moving at great speed. He added that the object looked perfectly round and flat with the center of the object being somewhat raised.  But was it a balloon? Two months later when Edward Ruppelt assumed the helm of the old Grudge project from Jerry Cummings, he carefully disseminated the information that had been collected on the case. Ruppelt was as intrigued as anyone with this fantastic sighting, and no one more than himself respected the experience of veteran flyers like Rogers and Ballard. Yet, Ruppelt put objectivity first. He even fired three assistants from his project in those early days who became too biased in their approach to investigations.  It was one of Ruppelt\'s more trusted associates, Henry \'Hank\' Metscher, who came up with what he felt was a solid argument that the sighting over Point Pleasant and the radar data from Fort Monmouth may have been attributable to balloon launches. Ruppelt relied on Metscher\'s more seasoned engineering background and careful analysis to compose a special November 30 status report to the Pentagon. It stated: ""At approximately 11:12 EDST, 10 September 1951 two balloons were released from the Evans Signal Laboratory, New Jersey, . . . and would have moved into a position nearly in line with Point Pleasant.""  Provided are illustrations from that report plotting the balloons and the course of the T-33 jet. Air Force records do prove that balloons were in the same area at the same time as the T-33, yet estimates place their altitude at 18,000 feet as opposed to the 5,000 feet ceiling Rogers approximated for the UFO. Those same records also show each balloon burst at a height of 104,000 feet not long after the incident transpired.  To provide further detail, following is an excerpt from Ruppelt\'s unedited manuscript to The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects. This paragraph never made it into his published book but does detail how ATIC viewed the case at the time:  The sighting by the two officers in the T-33 jet fell apart when Metscher learned that a balloon had been launched in the area of the sighting just a matter of minutes before the UFO was seen. Hank got out an aeronautical chart and plotted the path of the balloon, the path of the T-33, and the reported path of the UFO. The first thing that showed up was that the balloon was always along the line of sight between the T-33 and where the two officers thought the UFO had been. With a little more figuring Hank showed how every reported motion of the UFO could have been due to the relative motion between the balloon and the T-33, and the observer\'s inability to accurately estimate distances, since they didn\'t know how big their ""UFO"" really was. Colonel Rosengarten told the authors that he and Lt. Jerry Cummings personally questioned Rogers and Ballard. Although he too greatly respected their years of flying experience, Rosengarten is fairly convinced after talking to them that they simply saw a balloon under unusual circumstances. He also feels  that a balloon with foil reflectors on it, accounted for the earlier radar sightings.  After news accounts of the pilot\'s incident leaked to the papers, state  police officials were queried by reporters, but no collaborating testimony could be found to substantiate the sighting of an unusual object.  Yet another incident did occur that same afternoon of the 10th. Again, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey radar picked up a strange target. This time it was 18 miles above the earth traveling slowly. Soon, ground observers visually confirmed it even though all they could see was a silver speck in the sky. While Cummings conclusively proved that sighting was attributed to a balloon launch, more unexplained radar sightings followed the next day.  On September 11, a brief summary of the T-33 sighting was sent to ATIC from the 148th interceptor group at Dover AFB, Delaware, where Rogers and Ballard were based. On the next, day Wilbert Rogers himself followed up with another and much more carefully detailed summary to Dayton, addressed to none other than the Commanding General of the AMC! Fort Monmouth forwarded accounts too of the anomalous radar incidents. Then both pilots were debriefed at Stewart AFB, Newburg, New York, on the 17th by Eastern Air Defense Force Headquarters officials who on the 21st sent a summary of all of the sightings to ATIC as well as the ADC headquarters in Colorado Springs.  This was done according to several official regulations of the time requiring the reporting of unidentified aerial objects. These included Air Defense Command Letter 200-1 of 11 April 1951 requiring the reporting of ""unconventional aircraft,"" and an Eastern Air Defense Force directive of 19 February 1951, stipulating the same. Along with these new regulations was a directive from the Continental Air Defense Command in an earlier issuance of 200-1 dated 22 February 1951. It required any reports to be classified ""confidential."" However, as will be detailed, these same reports were apparently caught in a paper shuffle and did not make it to Major General Cabell, the head of Air Force Intelligence (AFOIN), in a timely fashion. This fact becomes the basis for the story to follow, namely because news of the T-33 sighting would first be leaked to the press. This leak came long before Cabell had a chance to be properly briefed on these seemingly fantastic events, which were not easily explainable at the time.  In setting the stage for this tale of a classic military snafu, it is also important to note that at that time Cabell had come under pressure by some American industrialists and scientists who felt the Air Force should be more responsive to UFO reports. Top among those influential men were Robert Johnson and a Mr. Brewster of Republic Aviation. Republic carried a lot of weight at that time because they were at the cutting edge of high speed fighter development. In fact, research then going on at Republic would lead directly to the F-105 Thunderchief which gained great fame during the Vietnam war a decade later.  Top people at Republic like Johnson and Brewster had an unusually tenacious interest in the early flying saucer sightings. The details are unclear, but AFOSI files show that both men learned of the Fort Monmouth cases and asked permission from the Eastern Air Defense Command to speak to Rogers and Ballard around September 20, still long before Cabell had been briefed on the incidents.  During their interview, Brewster showed the air crew ""sketches,"" possibly of experimental aircraft. Yet, both pilots told Brewster and Johnson that they had seen no indications of exhaust or propulsion units on the UFO. Records even show Brewster speculative of electrical propulsion of some kind. Brewster explained that he had names of other witnesses, who supposedly had similar sightings and were also interviewed by him and Johnson.  Aviation historian Joel Carpenter recently shared some interesting insights on why Republic may have been so interested in UFOs. As in many other instances, it seems that curiosity in flying saucers had less to do with astrophysical theories than the hard realities of the Cold War:  Each of the airframe contractors in the 40s and 50s had a specialty, and Republic\'s was fighters. They had an ace designer named Alexander Kartveli who was very interested in supersonic aerodynamics and came up with some very radical concepts for early jet fighters. (The P-84 that was running up at Muroc when the first disc sighting was made there was one of his designs.) In those days, Air Defense Command (or maybe still CONAD then) Hq was located at Mitchel Field, Long Island, and since Republic was right down the road in Farmingdale, it had an ³in² with the fighter command. Republic did a lot of studies for CONAD on the problems of how to use fighters to intercept high-speed bombers. If a bomber is flying near the speed of sound, it is very hard to detect it with radar, scramble the fighter, get the fighter to the exact point where it can fire its weapons, and shoot at exactly the right instant to hit the target. . . You can see why the Ft. Monmouth incident would have had a bearing on this, if the radar operators were tracking UFOs that were going too fast to be jets, what could possibly be done about them? So I think that the Republic men might have been in the Cabell meeting [when Cabell was finally briefed on the Ft. Monmouth incidents in detail on November 1] as experts on the problems of intercepting high-speed targets. The other aspect of this is that just a couple of days before the Cabell meeting, Republic had been awarded a contract to build one of the most incredible aircraft ever designed, the XF-103. This was a true interceptor. . . projects like the XF-103 take years to develop and they probably thought that by the time it was operational, the Soviets might have supersonic bombers. General Cabell had maintained an interest in the UFO mystery since he became director of AFOIN in May of 1948 but for whatever reason had delegated much of the responsibility to subordinates. By  1949, after the Sidney Shallet article, flying saucers were de-emphasized and collection memos for acquiring information on sightings were rescinded. Grudge officially closed in December of that year although work still went on at ATIC as new sighting reports were handled through routine intelligence channels. Cabell, however, who later characterized the Grudge final report as ""the most poorly written piece of unscientific tripe I\'ve ever read,"" seemed ready by late 1950 and early 1951 for a more active approach. It is not known why Cabell suddenly took greater interest in flying saucer reports by that time. An extensive reorganization had been completed by mid-1951 which had previously occupied a great deal of his attention. Perhaps by then, he simply had more time to devote to the subject of UFOs as a whole, during a period in which there was already growing concern about possible Soviet developments in heavy high speed bombers.  It does seem once war in Korea began in June 1950, that Cabell was quietly reconsidering the specific issue of flying saucer reports. In fact, at that time he may have come to the realization that his subordinates in AFOIN and Colonel Watson at ATIC were of the growing opinion that they had more important tasks at hand than dealing with the saucer sightings. This may be why they put such great emphasis on downplaying the investigations, so as not to make flying saucers an issue either privately or publicly.  We know by late 1950 collection memos on UFOs were re-issued and Major General Cabell started to express concern over what he saw as a continually troubling series of saucer reports. Colonel Watson and his deputy commander, Colonel Frank Dunn, were aware of this in particular. Cabell\'s office even later sent word down that he was to be awakened during the middle of the night if he was needed! Colonel Watson, although a very distinguished and respected officer, still apparently had a skepticism when it came to flying saucers. He continued to frown on anyone who claimed to have witnessed a  sighting. However, it does seem his deputy, Frank Dunn, did succeed him somewhere around the timeframe in which the Fort Monmouth incidents occurred.  (The records show Colonel Watson was officially reassigned around July of 1951 yet because he was then resisting leaving his beloved ATIC command, Watson may have still been in Dayton, trying to get Cabell to either change his orders to an Air Defense Command, or preferably to stay at ATIC. This would account for the fact that Ruppelt and Cummings both recalled in their correspondence that Watson had something to do with this story but also remember that his orders for reassignment came in before the Fort Monmouth events all played out.)  We do know from Ruppelt\'s private papers that Cabell by at least early 1951 had caught wind of Colonel Watson\'s hesitancy to divert significant manpower to saucer investigations. Ruppelt mentions that Cabell, at some point, climbed all over Watson and his Pentagon accomplices like Colonel Porter for ""conspiring to kill the UFO project.""  It is known that Watson\'s friend, Albert Deyarmond, remained at ATIC after the Colonel accepted a command in Europe. Thus ""Moose"" Deyarmond remained a key man in the ATIC hierarchy as Colonel Dunn filled Watson\'s shoes. It certainly seems Deyarmond continued to enforce Colonel Watson\'s so-called anti-saucer policies, as did Analysis Chief Colonel Brunow W. Feiling. The authors do not fully understand why because we also know Deyarmond was privately very interested in the subject and had been a strong supporter of an objective study when he was a member of Project Sign back in 1948. We also know that Ruppelt always understood him to be personally convinced in an extraterrestrial hypothesis for the origin of the phenomena.  Nevertheless, Colonel Watson\'s skeptical saucer policy still seemed to be in effect at ATIC by the fall of 1951. In fact, when word of the incredible Fort Monmouth sightings were officially reported to ATIC on the 11th and 12th from Dover AFB and the EADC at Newburg on the 21st, the accounts were dismissed by Colonel Feiling. Feiling completely bypassed Grudge and gave the reports directly to James Rodgers, who was by then no longer even in charge of Grudge.  Although the files do suggest that Colonel Dunn had learned of the incidents as early as the 11th. Records explain that on the 11th, the Air Materiel Command\'s Public Information Officer, Colonel Taylor, acquired a summary of the pilot\'s sighting from his counterpart at Mitchel AFB, PIO Major John B. Barron. Taylor passed the summary onto Colonel Dunn via Rex Smith, AMC Assistant PIO, on that same day. Yet the Pentagon never received any follow-up investigation from ATIC.  To Dunn\'s later horror, the only report that did make its way to Washington was initiated via that curious correspondence between PIO officers to a Colonel Carter of the Field Liaison Section, Directorate of Public Information in the Pentagon. When these sightings subsequently found their way to the national media as early as the 12th, Cabell eventually blew his top. We say ""eventually"" because, oddly, the General didn\'t catch wind of it until long after those press leaks made national headlines in papers like the Washington Daily News and The New York Times. Further, Cabell did not seem to learn about any of this until the 27th or 28th of that month! (The leak first originated from Mitchel AFB when Major Barron allowed a Long Island newspaper reporter, Dick Aurelio, to interview the pilot after Aurelio heard rumors of the sighting.)  Cabell had already told ATIC he wanted personal notification on any new UFO activity, and now he had to read about this outwardly amazing series of cases from a press desk circular that happened to cross his desk, 18 days after the event occurred!  After the news made headlines, the Air Defense Command also wanted more information. They had not received a final report on the sightings even though it involved pilots of its own [Eastern] Air Defense Command. ADC thus wanted Grudge on it right away, but they had no idea that the project had become so understaffed.  As Cabell attempted to wade through this horrendous mess on Friday morning of the 28th, his wartime years as a Pentagon assistant to the Commanding General of Army Air Forces, General ""Hap"" Arnold, may have come back to haunt him. Cabell had held a unique job as a trouble shooter on Arnold\'s personal staff during the madness following the attack on Pearl Harbor. That act by the Japanese, and the shortcomings which military intelligence subsequently found itself guilty of, forever dominated Cabell\'s  thinking.  Apparently by noon on that Friday, someone at ATIC found himself in a heated telephone conversation with Cabell. After receiving a yard long Teletype message from AFOIN later that afternoon, right at ATIC\'s 4:00 P.M. closing time, Analysis personnel knew they had to act. Colonel S.H. Kirkland Jr. was then moving up the ladder at ATIC and working with Colonel Watson\'s good buddy Moose Deyarmond, they secured orders (via the administrative ATIN office with a WD form 67) for Lieutenant Colonel Rosengarten to go to New Jersey. Rosengarten was to oversee an investigation of the case in time for a scheduled late Monday afternoon Pentagon conference on the matter with Cabell himself! It is of interest, however, that they told Lt. Col. Rosengarten to hold off on giving the General any definite analysis until all the facts of the case could be studied. (Keep in mind, this is already 18 days after the sighting took place.)  Because Lt. Col. Rosengarten was head of the Performance and Characteristics Branch under the Aircraft and Propulsion Section within ATIC\'s Analysis Division, he technically had the old Grudge project under his many commands. Lt. Col. Rosengarten always devoted a hundred percent effort to every task he was given and also sought to carry out assignments in a thorough and careful manner. So he took some time to consider seeking assistance on this important task. As he looked out from his office down the length of Analysis\' long hut-like home, he saw many desks lined up. At one of them he noticed Ed Ruppelt. Ruppelt occupied the exact same desk left by Alfred Loedding who, ironically, left ATIC eight months earlier for a job in Pennsylvania the very day Ruppelt arrived. Since then, Ruppelt had been recruited on occasion to assist with UFO assignments.  Yet logically, only one man should have the task because he was responsible for running Grudge. Lt. Col. Rosengarten\'s keen eye moved onto that man, good old Jerry Cummings. Cummings had only recently come to Grudge and like Ruppelt had been reactivated with the start of hostilities in Korea late in 1950. Although recently discovered files do reveal that Cummings did have an earlier tour at the old T-2 Intelligence group in Dayton during the tail end of World War Two. So he was obviously a capable man with prior experience in technical intelligence and apparently a highly skilled Cal. Tec. trained aeronautical engineer.  Rosengarten\'s opinion of Cummings was very high. It is evident from the UFO files released by the National Archives that a more serious approach was taken as soon as he took over what was left of the Grudge operation back in July. Cummings, however, often faced many hurdles. In fact, Cummings had been very put out when Feiling bypassed his office with the Fort Monmouth reports. He had complained about this to Deyarmond and to Lt. Col. Rosengarten. So now Rosengarten was giving him the chance to do his job.  Cummings was going too.  Although a few researchers have simply characterized Rosengarten and Cummings as doing damage control for ATIC, both men appeared eager to conduct a detailed and objective investigation. Admittedly, there are mysteries from those critical three days, spanning Friday, September 28 to Monday, October 1, but it is clear they were on a mission for Cabell which even had an ""Operational Immediate"" designation to it. Operational Immediate was the highest peacetime priority code issued at that time and this one had come direct from the old man himself! (It should be noted however that during our interview with Colonel Rosengarten in 1999, he told us that he only made the trip in person to ensure that Cummings received full cooperation.)  Their trip began after boarding a TWA commercial airliner late that Friday night at 11:30 P.M. EST. Rosengarten and Cummings flew direct to New York. The next morning they traveled to New Jersey and coordinated with the G-2 Signal Corps radar station at Fort Monmouth. While at Fort Monmouth they received excellent cooperation from the personnel at the radar station who were all very helpful to their investigation. Lt. Col. Rosengarten recorded:  Interrogation of the student [radar] personnel occupied Saturday, Saturday night, and Sunday morning and part of Sunday afternoon. Much time was spent attempting to fix with greater detail dates, time, and circumstances in order to find something of value.  . . . Then, the two pilots, Major Ballard flying as observer, and Lt. Rogers who was flying as pilot of a T-33, sighted an unidentified flying object and they flew into Fort Monmouth for interrogation. Cummings and Rosengarten were truly working around the clock because early into Monday morning Lt. Col. Rosengarten sent an R and R (routing and record sheet) wire message to the Office of Special Investigation. This 3:30 A.M. R&R; or special transmission officially requested follow-up assistance from the 2nd District AFOSI office on Broad Street in New York City. The AFOSI, in fact, routinely assisted with UFO investigations. Although in this case it seems Rosengarten initiated the AFOSI investigation himself, with authority from the commanding general at the Fort Monmouth radar base. For some reason, however, Ruppelt recalled that this created a ""famous hassle"" at ATIC. Following is Lt. Col. Rosengarten\'s 3:30 A.M. Monday morning message to the NY AFOSI that caused such a stir:  FROM NR ROSENGARTEN LT COL AFOIN-ATIAA-2 WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB AUTH BY CG FT MONMOUTH NJ. IT IS REQUESTED THAT OSI CONDUCT A DETAILED CHECK IMMEDIATELY AS TO HOW MAJOR BARRON RECEIVED INFORMATION CMA UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES 2 MEMBERS OF THE PRESS WERE GIVEN THIS INFORMATION OF THE INCIDENT PRIOR TO CONTACTING BARRON. DESIRE NAMES AND TIME OF OTHER MEMBERS OF PRESS INFORMED OF INCIDENT. IT IS DESIRABLE THAT EXACT TIME OF EACH CONVERSATION BE VERIFIED, WHERE APPROXIMATE, INDICATE. THIS INFORMATION IS URGENT AS PER COMMAND OF GENERAL CABELL AIR TECH INT WASHINGTON DC AND IS REQUIRED PRIOR TO 0800 1ST OF OCT AT FORT MONMOUTH ATTN LT. COL NR ROSENGARTEN CMA AIR TECH INTELLIGENCE HQ USAF OR BY 1200 1ST OCT AT AFOIN TC TO BE HELD FOR LT COL ROSENGARTEN. Earlier at 9:05 P.M. Sunday night, Lt. Col. Rosengarten had phoned the New York AFOSI and informed them of his oncoming wire. Then he again talked by phone to AFOSI duty officer Lieutenant Michael O. Pettee around the time of the 3:30 A.M. wire. Rosengarten told him that Mitchel AFB PIO Major Barron had no malicious intent when he allowed the pilots to talk to the press, but that the release of information in principle did violate regulations. He also feared a security breach had occurred despite Barron\'s best intended efforts as this AFOSI internal memo demonstrates:  Lt. Colonel Rosengarten, AFOIN-ATIAA-2, is assigned to the Director of Intelligence, Headquarters USAF, with duty at Wright-Patterson AFB, in Technical Intelligence. He dispatched the wire referred to in the R&R; from Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey, indicating that the information released carried the classification of Secret. He also stated in the wire that the inquiry had been personally and urgently requested by Major General Cabell, Director of Intelligence, Headquarters USAF, and that it was mandatory, if at all possible, to have the results of the interview available at AFOIN-TC, 1 October 1951, during which Rosengarten would be in conference with General Cabell and other personnel of the Technical Capabilities Branch, of OIN. The significance, if any, of this activity is unknown to OSI. Full information has been requested and has been promised by Major Parker, OIN, for 2 October 1951. I also pointed out verbally to OIN the irregular manner in which the request was made to OSI. Lucius L. Free, Lt. Col., USAF Sabotage and Espionage Branch. The AFOSI certainly worked fast. By 11:00 A.M. that Monday morning AFOSI Detachment Commander Major Paul L. McCoy had made a synopsis of the case. By 11:45 A.M. Lt. Col. Rosengarten was informed of the results of their speedy interview of Major Barron. McCoy then said he would forward any additional findings to the Pentagon in time for Rosengarten\'s 4:00 P.M. deadline with Major General Cabell.  In 1999, Colonel Rosengarten told the authors that leaks to the news media did indeed have the potential to cause unnecessary harm. Other primary sources have confirmed what will be documented later in this story, that there were key people in the Pentagon and Intelligence community who believed that one good tale about a ""flying saucer"" in a large newspaper could cause many people around the country to start looking for UFOs. Because most average citizens are not accustomed to closely observing the sky, they in turn will see things that are in many cases natural or man-made phenomena of which they themselves have no understanding. In theory, this would then lead to a flood of other UFO reports which would cause a great deal of extra work for the Air Force. It would take men like Ed Ruppelt off analysis work on Soviet aircraft and send him chasing all over the country interviewing UFO witnesses. This scenario would also hamper sincere efforts by ATIC to study the phenomenon. But most importantly, the main point is that public hysteria over UFOs could cause other units of the military to be overwhelmed with the issue and perhaps even hamper their ability to respond to a more earthly Cold War threat, the Cold War being the much more important concern of the day. Although such a scenario would later be championed by the CIA, it was one growing Air Force concern even at this time, whether the theory itself was valid or not. Thus, those at ATIC like Ed Ruppelt, despite what they felt personally, had to respect this attitude. Former ATIC veterans stated that this was simply respect for duty.  Even with such concerns, UFOs received attention by the Air Force. Any object in the sky of an unknown origin has been of interest to units like ATIC since the 1946 ""ghost rocket"" reports over Europe. Today, successor organizations are still just as worried about objects that cannot be identified. But, there are ""UFOs"" and then there are ""flying saucers."" Some like Colonel Watson and Major Boggs wanted to keep tabs on any UFOs associated with the USSR. But ""men from Mars"" did not openly seem to figure into their concerns even though others like Major General Cabell may have been more broad minded. Cabell, at least, became specifically concerned with the broad issue of flying saucers. So if there is any moral for this brief side bar to our story, it is that UFO projects after Sign had to first be focused on public reaction to UFOs. That is what Grudge became during Colonel Watson\'s reign. Grudge\'s successor, Blue Book, under Ruppelt\'s tenure would seek a more multi-dimensional role by 1952 but still had to keep in mind the Pentagon\'s desire to discourage the media from generating undue public concern.  Now to return to our story of the Fort Monmouth case, late into Sunday night the 30th and even on Monday morning of October 1, Cummings and Rosengarten worked to finish their investigation in time to meet Cabell\'s 4:00 P.M. Monday deadline for the all important Pentagon meeting. Neither man had had much sleep or food since they began their journey, but at least by Monday morning they felt they had done justice to their mission. At the last minute, however, they realized they couldn\'t even get a Signal Corps aircraft off the ground in time to make Washington by 4:00.  So, at Lt. Col. Rosengarten\'s initiative, he chartered a private plane to fly them to Washington. When they reached the Pentagon they briefed the General but soon found themselves participating in a briefing with not just Cabell, but other top AFOIN brass. (This meeting may have not occurred until the next morning at 10:00 A.M.)  Ruppelt\'s book provides a provocative description of that top secret meeting. Because of the significance of the passage it deserves to be quoted in full exactly as stated by Edward Ruppelt:  [Major] General Cabell presided over the meeting, and it was attended by his entire staff plus Lieutenant Cummings, Lieutenant Colonel Rosengarten, and a special representative from Republic Aircraft Corporation. The man from Republic supposedly represented a group of top U.S. industrialists and scientists who thought that there should be a lot more sensible answers coming from the Air Force regarding the UFOs. The man was at the meeting at the personal request of a general officer. Every word of the two-hour meeting was recorded on a wire recorder. The recording was so hot that it was later destroyed, but not before I had heard it several times. I can\'t tell everything that was said but, to be conservative, it didn\'t exactly follow the tone of the official Air Force releases, many of the people present at the meeting weren\'t as convinced that the \'hoax, hallucination, and misidentification\' answer was quite as positive as the Grudge Report and subsequent press releases made out. Toward the end of the two-hour conference a general asked Lieutenant Cummings to review the activity of the UFO investigation for the past year and a half. Maybe it was just a lack of sleep, or maybe it was just Cummings, but the general got the straight answer, for all practical purposes the project was dead. Then Cummings proceeded to elaborate on the details, the attitude at ATIC, the opposition to his reorganizing the project, and the methods of processing reports. Lieutenant Cummings didn\'t miss a point. He later told me that all of the generals and about three fourths of the full colonels present at the meeting turned the shade of purple normally associated with rage while a sort of sickly grin graced the faces of the remaining few. Then one of the generals on the purple-faced team glared at the sickly-grin team and cut loose. The first thing the general wanted to know was, \'Who in the hell has been giving me these reports that every decent flying saucer sighting is being investigated?\' Then others picked up the questioning. \'What happened to those two reports that General __ sent in from Saudi Arabia? He saw those two flying saucers himself.\' [That case actually occurred after this meeting took place during the next year of 1952 to a General E.M. Day, apparently the case that was so discussed at that meeting was the Mantell Incident. Because Ruppelt made such an effective argument in his book that the Mantell Incident was not UFO related, he probably substituted the Saudi Arabia sighting so as not to bring the issue of Mantell up again.] \'And who released this big report, anyway?\' another person [we now know this was Major General Cabell] added, picking up a copy of the Grudge Report and slamming it back down on the table. We understand that during the meeting Cummings told Cabell all he knew about the behind -the-scenes influences on Project Grudge. Yet, research cannot completely pin down Lt. Col. Rosengarten\'s own view. In 1999 Colonel Rosengarten simply told the authors that he just leaned back and let Cummings go.  Lt. Col. Rosengarten did not necessarily disagree with him but would not have characterized the situation in that manner nor have the discourtesy to reprimand Cummings in front of his own superiors. He knew Cummings had no intention himself of making a career out of the military. Besides, Rosengarten said everybody loved that guy if for no other reason than he was so bright.  Ruppelt simply wrote that about that time in the meeting, \'Cummings dropped his horn rimmed glasses down on his nose, tipped his head forward, peered at Major General Cabell over his glasses and acting not at all like a first lieutenant, said that the UFO investigation was all fouled up.\'  Through personal conversations with Colonel Rosengarten, the authors learned of his high regard for not only Cummings but Colonel Watson, and Watson\'s administration of ATIC. These authors also greatly respect Colonel Watson\'s service but do not understand his apparently skeptical attitude toward UFOs and why ATIC sought to focus only on the public relations issues under his command. Colonel Watson was, in fact, an outstanding officer, no one ever stated anything to the contrary.  In his early career he had been a highly technically trained \'engine man.\' Since earning his bachelor\'s degree in electrical engineering in 1933 and completing some more course work at Yale, Watson proved himself a valued research engineer for Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company. By 1936, however, he decided to join the Army Air Corps. Watson wanted to learn to fly.  He did become a flying cadet and soon came under the experienced wing of none other than Lieutenant Curtis LeMay, strategic bombing visionary and future Air Force Chief of Staff. Watson excelled in flying school as he did in every endeavor in life but due to what was considered a mature age of 25 and an unusually high technical expertise, he was destined for desk work. So in June of 1937 he began a tour at Langley Field as an Engineering Officer. Although not one to be detoured from his passions, he learned to fly almost every aircraft in the inventory despite his assigned duties.  In 1939, while beginning the first of five tours at Dayton, 1st Lieutenant Watson went to work in the Wright Labs Power Plant Division, specializing in engine quality and production liaison with major manufacturers for the Air Force. It was around this time that Watson and Red Honaker became such close friends. Honaker was a clerk at the flight desk in those days and always gave Watson the word when a hot new aircraft came into the field, Watson still being eager to log flight time on his weekends off.  By the time America entered the war, Lieutenant Watson was working to complete his masters degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Michigan. This was quite an opportunity as only three people from Wright Labs were picked for this advanced course work. After graduation, Captain Watson returned to being a valuable trouble shooter in engine quality control and even testified before Senator Harry S Truman\'s oversight committee as an expert in aircraft power plant production.  Moving from captain to major in one month, he became a key Army liaison with the Wright-Aero factory in Cincinnati, Ohio. During the latter part of the war Lieutenant Colonel Watson distinguished himself as Director of Maintenance for the 1st Tactical Air Force in an overseas assignment in England. His work impressed General Hap Arnold, Commanding General of the Army Air Forces. But it was Commanding General of U.S. Strategic Air Forces, General \'Tooey\' Spaatz, who picked him for the assignment he is most known for. Spaatz put him in charge of Operation Lusty‹an endeavor to recover German aircraft technology. The small group of ace test pilots and master mechanics Watson led around Europe at the end of the war became known as Watson\'s \'Whizzers.\' They all had great admiration for their commander, by then a full Colonel.  While in this assignment, Watson finally got to do some \'official\' test flying. Of course, in actuality, he had always managed to fly the latest new aircraft, working out mechanical problems. Until this point, however, Watson had never been rated as a test pilot. As head of Operation Lusty he had the chance to make that grade while flying many new high performance German designs such as the Messerschmitt 262 jet fighter.  The assignment certainly fit Watson\'s flamboyant personality and called on his widely varied talents, but it was indeed dangerous work. On one adventure Watson almost lost his life when a German saboteur attached an explosive device to a Junkers-290 transport that he and his men were returning home on via a bold Atlantic crossing. When the fearless Watson landed in this huge aircraft, the bomb was discovered under the main fuel tank and luckily disarmed without incident. For his many exploits during Project Lusty, Colonel Watson received the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal.  As an interesting side note, many individuals who were involved in other projects to recover German technology during the war (like Albert Deyarmond, Howard McCoy, Miles Goll, Malcolm Seashore, Donald Putt, and John O\'Mara) ended up working with Watson over the years. Virtually anyone who had the honor to serve with or under Watson spoke of him highly. The authors also stress that they have the highest respect for Harold Watson. His biography by Air Force historian Bruce Ashcroft even begins with a statement that he \'was the type of person who would roll up his shirt sleeves and work side-by-side with his people.\'  He was a fine officer, but what accounts for his skeptical behavior in regard to UFOs, or perhaps we should say flying saucers? Why did he seem to have such little patience or interest associated with UFO investigations?  Perhaps he gained unique insights on the phenomenon during his third tour at Wright Field as head of the Collections Division for T-2 in 1945 and 1946. Or during a tour at the Industrial College and then the Pentagon in 1947 to 1949, when he learned something modern researchers do not understand. Maybe he was quoted by Ruppelt as saying \'flying saucers are a bunch of nonsense\' because he knew the reports to be unreliable. These authors are willing to appreciate that there are other insights, and  certainly Colonel Watson was in a position to have a first hand perspective.  However, one source suggested to the authors that Watson may have actually believed in \'flying saucers\' and certainly Cabell did. Although, this is not to imply that they believed in an extraterrestrial origin per se but the reality of a phenomenon or a whole set of phenomena. Watson did apparently come to loggerheads with Cabell but not over belief in UFOs.  They both knew there was something unexplainable. It was all over their approach. Watson wanted to deal with flying saucers by discouraging investigation into them and making it an unpopular issue in the press. In short, the disc reports were just so unexplainable that he wanted to ignore them to concentrate on Cold War issues.  Major General Cabell, on the other hand, desired investigation, as good an investigation as ATIC\'s budget would allow, but wanted the press controlled with tact, not ridiculed. Both men also clearly worried about the UFO issue hampering the military\'s effectiveness, as has already been detailed.  To back this up, an anonymous source stressed to the authors that the public\'s impression in the 1950s was that the primary job of the Air Force was supposed to be air defense. Although numerous other high ranking officers may have also believed in flying saucers \'as a phenomenon,\' they did not want this known. They worried that if it became common knowledge the public might lose confidence in the Air Force\'s ability to defend America\'s skies.  Along with this thought, many in the Air Force sincerely worried about creating a state of panic as was believed to have been demonstrated by Orson Welles\' well-known 1938 Halloween radio drama. On that famous night the dramatic actor Orson Welles produced and narrated a play based on H.G. Wells\' book, The War of the Worlds. Like the classic account of a Martian invasion, the radio show was a frightening success. Unfortunately for many East Coast listeners, it seemed so real that some were claimed to have flown into a panicked frenzy, actually believing aliens were landing in Grovers Mill, New Jersey. Apparently, a few suicides actually occurred as a result.  A portion of Ruppelt\'s early unedited manuscript to The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects discusses the Orson Welles\' broadcast. Ruppelt states that his office was even ordered to investigate the so-called panic and present a report on it.  While concern over that 1938 incident may sound ridiculous today, these authors have proof it was a very real mind-set of Pentagon and government officials from that time. Of course the clear implication here is that in order for those same officials to subscribe to such a theory, they must have believed that the discs were extraterrestrial in origin! Our source did not know if Cabell or Watson\'s views went that far but did suggest to us that they were believers. Ruppelt\'s personal papers also characterize Cabell as \'pretty much a believer in the UFOs.\'  In regard to this famous Pentagon meeting, however, Colonel Rosengarten recently told the authors that contrary to Ruppelt\'s account, it was mostly low key with nowhere near the number of participants described. But as stated, he fondly and respectfully remembers Cummings going on about Grudge and making quite an impression.  Colonel Rosengarten said with affection, \'that boy could talk a starved dog off of a bloody meat wagon, he was so persuasive.\' Colonel Rosengarten also has a very clear memory of Major General Cabell. Near the end of the conference Cabell apparently did get worked up, taking the Grudge report and driving it into the table.  But Colonel Rosengarten states that Cabell, also unlike in Ruppelt\'s account, was not angry with ATIC in general, just all the press coverage of UFOs. His point here is that Cabell wanted to prevent the media from focusing too much public attention on the subject until the Air Force had a fair chance to investigate the phenomenon.  Cabell, in fact, challenged ATIC to prove that UFOs did exist! In other words, Cabell thought that trying to prove a negative assumption was a futile exercise in any sort of Intelligence endeavor. Colonel Rosengarten also stated that Cabell was a very fine officer and treated both him and Cummings with great respect and attention. Never at any time in Colonel Rosengarten\'s memory of that meeting did the General express doubts in ATIC\'s ability to face the challenges associated with UFOs under the new leadership of Col. Dunn.  Now before we stop there, the authors have just recently uncovered still a third version of this landmark Pentagon meeting. We have read what Ruppelt wrote in the pages of his popular book and studied what Colonel Rosengarten recalls. Yet, here is something from Ruppelt\'s private papers that is straight from the mouth of Jerry Cummings.  The passage originated from a conversation Ruppelt had with Jerry Cummings on January 14, 1955, when Ruppelt was compiling his manuscript. Surprisingly, it seems to suggest Colonel Watson may still have been at ATIC as late as the end of September or at least around that general time frame. We thank Professor Michael Swords for sharing this very important document from his files:  [Edward Ruppelt writes:] On 14 January 1955, I had lunch with Jerry Cummings who was then working for Radioplane Corporation in Van Nuys. Since Jerry had been in charge of Blue Book in September 1951, he had the story on how the project got a shot of added emphasis from the sightings at Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey. (Jerry got out of the Air Force shortly after this and went back to work at Cal Tec.) Jerry said that on the afternoon of September 1951 [no exact date given but his story apparently begins in mid month] he was in the office when he got a call from Lt. Col. Rosengarten, who was chief of the Aircraft and Propulsion Section at ATIC. [sic, Performance and Characteristics Branch of the Aircraft and Propulsion Section.] Rosy [sic, his nickname was spelled Rosie] was out [sic] boss. Rosy had a wire that had come in from Ft. Monmouth telling about the sightings there of the past few days. The wire was about 4\' long and very detailed. It was obvious from the tone of the wire that it had created quite a stir at Ft. Monmouth. When the wire had come into Feiling\'s office (Col. Bruno[w] Feiling, Chief of the Analysis Division) about 1300 he had sent it on to Capt Roy James in the Electronics Branch since the sighting involved radar. Somehow Jim [James] Rodgers, ex-chief of Blue Book (at the time it was Grudge and there is no evidence Roy James ever headed Grudge) had gotten into the act. Rodgers and [Roy] James were laughing about the whole thing when Cummings first heard about it. He was a bit hacked because he was supposed to have the Project but there was nothing that he could do. The reason for the interest by Rodgers and James, supposedly the first team, was that there had been a rumble that someone in Washington was interested and a quick answer was needed. Cummings was \'too slow.\' After they messed around with the report for awhile, [the ATIC records show a number of days] speculating on what they could use for an answer, Rosy had gotten wind of the report and he went into Feiling\'s office to complain that if he was responsible for the UFO reports he should be the first one to get them. Rodgers was called in and he gave the report to Rosy. Rodgers already had an answer, \'the whole outfit were a bunch of young impressionable kids and the T-33 crew had seen a reflection.\' Rodgers had supposedly reported these findings to Col. Watson, the Chief of ATIC, and Watson had supposedly bought the idea. Rosy didn\'t like this answer and Cummings like[d] it less, when he saw the wire in Rosy\'s office. They decided not to call in James again because neither one of them trusted his judgment. Cummings was just getting ready to go over to Wright Field to get someone from the Radiation Lab to take a look at the report when a wire came in from Washington. [Apparently now Cummings is referring to Friday, September 28th.] The time was now about 1600. The wire indicated that [Major] General Cabell had seen a copy of the wire from Ft. Monmouth [heard of it via the news leak on the sighting] and that he wanted to know what ATIC thought. Rodgers put the pressure on to send his answer back to the Pentagon and \'get them off our backs.\' He claimed that Watson was in agreement with him. [Ruppelt adds here:] (Possible Watson wasn\'t there. If Watson wasn\'t there it was Dunn, but this doesn\'t sound like Dunn. Jerry kept saying Watson.) Both Rosy and Cummings were against this and when it looked as if Rodgers might be going to win out when someone (I didn\'t get who) called the Pentagon and talked to Gen Cabell\'s assistant, a colonel [John Schweizer]. This colonel was very surprised to hear that there was even any question at all as to whether or not anyone would go out and investigate the report so whoever it was from ATIC that was on the phone weaseled around to make it sound as if they were going to go to Monmouth and had planned to do it all of the time. [This may have been Albert Deyarmond.] The Colonel, Cabell\'s assistant, added that the General had said that he wanted this report fully investigated and that if they weren\'t getting the proper cooperation they should call him or the General and get him out of bed, if necessary. With this it was decided that a trip should be made and Rosy and Cummings got a hurried set of orders [we now know from Cabell himself but approved by the new ATIC Analysis chief by the 28th, Colonel S.H. Kirkland] and were on their way. When they got to New Jersey [on the 29th] they called the Pentagon and found Cabell had left word that he was to be briefed at the earliest possible moment. The General said that he wanted to be briefed on Monday (??) [October 1] at the latest. [It seems this order for a prompt investigation and a follow-up Pentagon meeting on Monday October 1st was already part of the Operational Immediate message received by ATIC on September 28th which initiated the whole trip.] When they got to Monmouth, Cummings and Rosy got in touch with the OD and the OD got them transportation. The Signal Corps was very cooperative. They talked to all concerned and got their story. [This is all confirmed by Colonel Rosengarten.] The pilot and passenger of the T-33 flew up to Mitchel (??) [the next day, Sunday September 29th] and Rosy and Cummings went over there to talk to them [and was still working with them on Monday morning the 1st of October]. They [the pilots] were both completely sold that the UFO was real. They didn\'t have any idea what it was but they were convinced that it was something \'intelligently controlled.\' [Ruppelt\'s reflections again:] (It is interesting to note that weeks later, when we proved, at least to my satisfaction, that the UFO was a balloon, the two officers said that we were nuts.  They found several holes in our analysis.) [Colonel Rosengarten confirmed this to the authors. He said, \'those pilots would have reached out and slugged us when we interviewed them if we suggested that the facts which we were uncovering actually indicated a balloon as the culprit.\'] Rosy and Jerry found out that the press had gotten a hold of the story and they didn\'t like it one bit. At this time the UFO project was a fairly well guarded secret for two reasons: (1) Many people believed that these UFO\'s were from outer space and they didn\'t want to cause any alarm, and (2) the other faction, led by Watson, and obediently followed by Rodgers and James, believed that if you stuck your head deep enough into the sand that they would go away. [Interviews with Colonel Rosengarten indicate that radar expert Roy James was not as skeptical of UFOs as he was doubtful of the capabilities of the primitive state of current radar technology at that time.] [Ruppelt continued reporting:] In addition, Watson had been telling the reporters that the Project was dead. Cabell read this, evidently, but he was for keeping it all quiet and thought that this story from ATIC was just a cover-up. The story had leaked out when the T-33 crew talked to the tower and when they had inadvertently talked to each other on the VHF instead of the intercom. Later on they were talking in a bar and a reporter [Dick Aurelio] overheard them. Both of these bits of intelligence were put together and the local story evolved [via the good intentioned help of the PIO, Major John B. Barron, at Mitchel AFB]. Cummings somewhere got word that the ADC radar site at or near Sandy Hook had been picking up targets at the same time as the activity was going on at Monmouth so he went to [the] site to try to find out what was going on. He got a very cold reception and had to call the Duty Officer at D/I to get into the place. When he did he found out that things were all fouled up. The radar logs showed unidentified targets but the officer said that they were SAC aircraft on a classified training mission. The log didn\'t show this however. Jerry did think that he established that the radar had no target other than the T-33 at the time of the sighting. When Rosy and Cummings finished they couldn\'t get a flight to Washington so they again called the Pentagon to see if they could get an aircraft to come up after them. They didn\'t have aircraft that intelligence could get so the Pentagon said to charter a plane. This they did [with the help of Lt. Col. Rosengarten\'s own initiative]. When they got to Washington they cleaned up and went out to the Pentagon and Gen. Cabell had a meeting set up. There were several people from the aircraft industry at the meeting. How they had found out about the meeting, Jerry didn\'t know. One of the men was a Mr. Brewster from Republic Aircraft. The whole meeting was recorded on wire but several weeks later, at ATIC, at the direction of either Col. Watson or Deyarmond, the wire was destroyed. I heard it before it was destroyed, however. The meeting was a rough one. While Jerry and Rosy were in New Jersey the General had done a little bit of checking. He had called ATIC and talked to Rodgers and it was obvious that Rodgers didn\'t have the answers that the General thought he should have. He got a good clue that Project Grudge had been scuttled a long time before. When the briefing was rolling the General asked Jerry to give a resume of what had been taking place on Project Grudge. Jerry told me that he looked at Rosy and got the OK sign, so he cut loose [Colonel Rosengarten did not confirm this to the authors]. He told how every report was taken as a huge joke; that at the personal direction of Watson, Rodgers, Watson\'s #1 stooge, was doing everything to degrade the quality of the reports; and how the only analysis consisted of Rodger\'s trying to think up new and original explanations that hadn\'t been sent to Washington before. Rodgers couldn\'t even find half of the reports. The General then got on his horse. He said, I want an open mind, in fact, I order an open mind. Anyone that doesn\'t keep an open mind can get out, now. As long as there is any element of doubt, the Project will continue. About this time one of the General\'s staff suggested that since there were industry observers present, maybe the remarks should be kept objective or that the industry people chouls [sic] leave. This got the Old Man and he said that he didn\'t care how embarrassing it was, he wasn\'t ashamed to give people the devil in front of strangers. [Colonel Rosengarten does not remember any representatives of private industry being present at the meeting.] He said that the apparent disregard of his orders were a source of concern. He complimented Cummings and Rosy by saying that he was glad to \'Get action.\' [This point is confirmed by our interview with Colonel Rosengarten.] The General asked about the results of the investigations of several other good sightings but a telephone check to ATIC showed that they had been lost, no one ever could find them. [These may refer to some records which other sources confirm were destroyed at ATIC either in late 1950 and/or represented records from late 1950 which were destroyed about that general time.] His next question was: \'Why do I have to stir up the action? Anyone can see that we do not have a satisfactory answer to the saucer question.\' Cabell went on to say that he wanted some action. He wanted the Project reorganized and he wanted all of the directives reissued because, he said, it was obvious that they were not being followed. Then, Jerry told me, the General looked at his staff of colonels for about 45 seconds and said, \'I\'ve been lied to, and lied to, and lied to, and lied to. I want it to stop. I want the answer to the saucers and I want a good answer.\' [Colonel Rosengarten respectfully maintains that Cabell\'s blowup at that meeting was not over ATIC\'s failure to investigate but the press leaks surrounding the T-33 sighting. The reasoning he gives is that Cabell did believe there was certainly something to the flying saucers and for that reason he wanted to keep it all as quiet as possible until they found the answer. Again, the 1938 War of the Worlds broadcast is alluded to in this context as an example of the mind-set/concerns expressed at that meeting. He says he never heard of J.J. or E.H. Porter, Aaron Jerry Boggs, William Adams, Weldon Smith, or others that modern day researchers speculate may have been associated with that meeting.] He started in on the Mantell Sightings and said that he had never heard such a collection of contradictory and indefinite statements. He said that he thought that he had a big activity operating and found out the only man, and apparently incompetent one at that, fumbling around trying to make excuses. Col. Porter [Ruppelt words:] (whom I considered to be one of the most totally incompetent men in the Air Force for reasons other than the UFO Project) was his old stupid self and said that he still thought that the project was a waste of time. The General\'s reply was that he didn\'t consider himself a crackpot or impressionable person and that he had a great deal of doubt in his mind that the saucers were all \'hoaxes, hallucinations or the misinterpretation of known objects.\' He took a swing at the famous Grudge Report by saying that it was the \'most poorly written, unconclusive piece of unscientific tripe\' that he\'d ever seen. The General ended up the meeting by giving a pep talk and saying that he thought that things would change and that the saucers would become respective [sic]. He said that he was going to keep an open mind and that he wanted the same from his staff. [This is confirmed by Cabell\'s own autobiography.] Cummings and Rosy came back to ATIC but the battle wasn\'t over. Watson hadn\'t been at the meeting, he had sent Col Dunn. Watson didn\'t openly fight the Project but he drug his feet for all he was worth. It wasn\'t until Watson went to Europe that the Project began to pick up. [The exact date of Watson\'s departure for  Europe has still not been conclusively ascertained by any Air Force documents.] It is known via a letter dated October 5 from the Inspector General\'s office that after the Pentagon meeting concluded, Cabell no longer felt a security violation had occurred but that the sightings were of significant interest. (Around this time Cabell even requested a review of German secret weapons technology, a link to flying saucers that the first investigators like Alfred Loedding tried but failed to establish four years prior.)  A final report mentioned in that letter was to be drafted by AFOIN but has never surfaced. Cabell did soon send word down to reactivate or create a new Project Grudge, hereafter referred to as New Grudge. Colonel Dunn was instructed to give greater attention to the  persistent flying saucer problem as he assumed his new duties as ATIC commander. (Around the time of the Pentagon meeting Col. Watson had already been \'relieved\'  and was getting ready for reassignment to General Lauris Norstaadt\'s command in Europe.)  Also on his way out was the chief of Analysis at ATIC, Colonel Brunow Feiling, replaced by the up and coming and more objective Colonel Kirkland, who was already in place at ATIC by late September.  Colonel E.H. Porter\'s assistant and Pentagon liaison to ATIC, arch saucer-killer Jerry Boggs, was out too, being temporarily replaced by Lieutenant M.D. Willis before Major Dewey Fournet took his position. Fournet would, in contrast to Boggs, adopt an eventual very pro-saucer approach.  Nevertheless, Colonel Porter remained as Deputy Director for Estimates. He was apparently one of those officers at the Pentagon meeting with a sickly grin on his face when Cabell blew his top. But UFO friendly individuals working under Porter such as Colonel William A. Adams and  Colonel Weldon Smith would soon have a significant impact on establishing a more open-minded approach. (Smith worked under Adams who eventually became Chief of the Topical Intelligence Division for the Deputy Director for Estimates at the Directorate of Intelligence, AFOIN. Although at the time Adams was Deputy of the Evaluation Division known as AFOIN-2B3.)  So whether it was by design or chance, men with much more open minds when it came to the UFO phenomenon assumed key positions in both Dayton and Washington. Although at WPAFB, as urgent as Cabell\'s orders appeared, no one really seemed to want the added duty. Dunn proceeded to put all the responsibility on Rosengarten who then put it on Cummings, but Cummings soon left the Air Force around mid November to return to work deemed of importance at the California Institute of Technology. So, the task went back up to Lt. Col. Rosengarten. He passed it on to Lieutenant Ruppelt and Lieutenant Henry Metscher who had both already worked with Cummings.  During our interview with Colonel Rosengarten, he stressed that one has to realize that the war in Korea and the Cold War in general occupied great amounts of energy. UFOs certainly were supposed to get better attention, but they were still but a part of the big picture. Colonel Rosengarten added that ATIC was backlogged with many types of analysis chores dating back to the end of WWII as well as new and urgent work on Soviet aircraft. All of this took a huge portion of AMC/ATIC\'s human and financial resources. A recently declassified 1951 history of ATIC shows just how busy they really were with Cold War matters. For example, the Analysis Division, with only 37 technically trained military personnel, had 31 separate projects underway  just in the Aircraft and Propulsion Section alone. One of these was titled Project 10124, a study of Soviet aircraft power-plant development. Project 10095 analyzed foreign aircraft fuels and lubricants. Project 10118 evaluated German swept-forward wing bombers that had been developed by the Junkers group of engineers commandeered by the Russians at the end of the war. It also studied Soviet delta-wing designs. One of the highest priority projects in the Analysis Division concerned estimating Russian bomber developments. This was of such high priority because real fears then existed over a Soviet nuclear strike against the United States by long-range heavy bombers. Project 10102 dealt with that concern which in 1951 acquired aerial photographs of the Type-27 Soviet multi-purpose bomber. These photographs were sent to the Analysis Division\'s Aircraft and Propulsion Section. They then may have directly come under Lt. Col. Rosengarten\'s attention as head of the Performance and Characteristics Branch.  Another effort only recently declassified, concerned a Hungarian-operated Soviet Yak-11 trainer which crashed landed in Siegenburg, Germany. This became the basis of Project 10098 and focused on a careful examination of the aircraft after it was delivered to ATIC in November of  1951.  Project 10115, which Ruppelt had assisted with, analyzed the Mig-15. At the time the Mig-15 generated great concern because it was close in performance to our best fighter aircraft. In July of 1951, ATIC was lucky enough to receive a crashed Mig-15, although it was very badly damaged. The most startling discovery from this project was that the engine used in the Mig-15 was an exact copy of the British Rolls-Royce Nene engine. ATIC forwarded this engine to the Pratt & Whitney Division of United Aircraft Corporation for detailed evaluation and sent the airframe to Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory for evaluation under a contract with them.  The UFO project was designated 10073. A section from the ATIC history dealing with Project 10073 obviously was not written until very late in 1951, after Ruppelt reorganized the effort. It states the following:  This project involves the collection of reports of unidentified aerial objects; the evaluation, as to source and content, of reports of visual or electronic sightings of unidentified aerial objects submitted by military or civilian sources; the investigation of reports of such sightings through field work when deemed necessary; and the preparation of periodic status reports for the information of the D/I, Hq USAF. This investigation has been in progress for approximately four years and a new increase in activity has been initiated in studying and indexing project records to enable a statistical survey of incidents to be accomplished. It is contemplated that all of the sightings of unconventional flying objects will be cross-indexed according to size, color, location, etc., so that as much statistical data as possible will be available. It is believed that possibly several general characteristics of the sightings will be determined from the mass of data on file in ATIC. This project concentrated on those incidents that appear to have originated from high grade sources, such as pilots, technically trained people, etc. The exception to this was where a number of sightings occur in a certain area at about the same time. Henry Metscher has also spoken with the authors to help document this time period. Metscher was from the Analysis Division\'s Aircraft and Propulsion Section and specialized in aerodynamic engineering. He recalls that he and Ruppelt were kept extremely busy on all sorts of assignments. During this period they were assisting with UFOs only as part of many duties. By the time New Grudge formally got underway around early December, he had left the Performance and Characteristics Branch. Although he only briefly worked with Ruppelt, Metscher stressed for the record that Ruppelt was \'one of the finest men I ever met.\'  Ruppelt had been a decorated B-29 bombardier and radar operator during WWII with over 1,500 hours in the air. During the war he won five battle  stars, two theater combat ribbons, three Air Medals, the Distinguished Flying Cross with Oak Leaf Clusters, and a Presidential Citation. Ruppelt had gone over with the first B-29 squadron to India as a lead bombardier in the 677th Squadron, 444th Bomb Group, 58th Wing of the 20th Air Force. He remained in the 20th throughout the whole strategic bombing campaign against Japan, following it to Tinian Island from India and China. He even flew on the last conventional raid of the war.  After WWII he became a navigator in the Iowa Air Reserves and entered Iowa State College, earning a BS degree in aeronautical engineering in 1950. With the outbreak of war in Korea, he received a recall to full-time duty from the Air Force and came into Intelligence at Wright- Patterson AFB in early 1951. Given work immediately on classified projects by Lt. Col. Rosengarten, Ruppelt soon gained a reputation at ATIC as a problem solver.  Although he would prove to be the best administrator of a UFO project the Air Force would ever have, he did not have the credentials or rank that would normally be drawn upon for what on the surface seemed a very important intelligence assignment. Only 28 years old at the time, Ruppelt was not a career officer. Still a 1st lieutenant by that fall, it is very odd that any non-career tracked officer would be put in charge of a project as important as one involving possible aerial intrusions into United States air space.---- source: ""Captain Edward J.

The aircraft was probably bound for Gander to refuel judging by its position and course of 230 degrees true, though the report does not mention this. US Naval Reserve Lieutenant Graham Bethune, co-pilot of Flight 125, was occupying the captain's seat on the left side of the cockpit in the passenger plane when he first sighted a huge object [at least] 300 feet in diameter on a near collision course with their aircraft.  The co-pilot stated in his official report,... I observed a glow of light below the horizon about 1,000 to 1,500 feet [330-470 meters] above the water.  We both [the pilot as well] observed its course and motion for about 4 or 5 minutes before calling it to the attention of the other crew members... Suddenly its angle of attack changed. Its altitude and size increased as though its speed was in excess of 1,000 miles [1,670 kilometers] per hour. It closed in so fast that the first feeling was we would collide in midair.  At this time, its angle changed and the color changed. It then [appeared] definitely circular and reddish orange on its perimeter.  It reversed its course and tripled its speed until it was last seen disappearing over the horizon.  The co-pilot's report goes on to say that the object came within five miles of their aircraft which was borne out by radar evidence of the encounter because the object had been tracked by DEW Line Ground Radar at the base in Goose Bay, Labrador.

1942, ,"['The Battle of Los Angeles, Part 1Case and point: A UFO event of mass proportion: a giant Alien spaceship hovering over one of our major cities, threatening our very existence. A scenario from ""War of the Worlds,"" ""Independence Day,"" or ""The Day the Earth Stood Still""? NO! it is NOT science fiction, it has ALREADY happened. When? February 25th, 1942 in the Los Angeles area.  Many believe that the ""beginning"" of the UFO era was in 1947, when Kenneth Arnold sighted flying disc-like objects over Mt. Rainier, coining the phrase ""flying saucers."" This term was already common military jargon by the time of the Roswell event of the same year. Preceding these landmark UFO events was the mass sighting of a large flying disc in the Los Angeles area in February 25th, 1942. Coming at a time of heightened security and anxiety following the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor only a few months before, this invasion would become a major UFO event, and possibly an omen of things to come. In Ufology, this is commonly referred to as:The Battle of Los AngelesThe early morning hours of 2-25-42 would bring the first alerts of an invasion. Naturally, the first thought in the minds of everyone was that another wave of Japanese planes was attacking America on its own soil. Citizens of Culver City and Santa Monica would be the first to witness the surreal sight of a giant unknown object hovering over the suburban areas of Los Angeles. Immediately, an air raid siren shattered the peaceful sleep of the residents, and volunteer Air Raid Wardens grabbed their gear, and headed to the streets,affecting a total blackout.  Army\'s 37th Coast Artillery Brigade swung into action, lighting up the clear, black skies with their massive spotlights. What they saw was beyond belief. With the Japanese planes still flying in their nightmares, another menacing flying machine was now right on top of them.In a matter of a few short minutes, the entire southern area of California waslooking to the skies, watching the intense spotlight beams converging on thegiant invading UFO. The 37th\'s anti-aircraft guns helped light up the night, firing volley after volley at the large craft. Many eyewitness reports would state that the large object took many direct hits, but appeared undamaged.The 30+ minute barrage would send fragmented shells over homes, businesses, and citizens. In the aftermath six individuals were found dead from the spent and fragmented artillery shells.It was reported that hundreds upon hundreds of rounds were fired at the giantUFO, yet it appeared unaffected. Eyewitness accounts described the object asa ""surreal, hanging, magic lantern."" The object was especially visible as ithovered over the MGM studios in Culver City. There are a number of newspaperarticles of this event, and an astonishingly clear picture of the object as itwas under its heaviest attack. The object eventually made its way over Long Beach, before it silently disappeared from view. The cannons were now silent.Some of the most intriguing testimony of the UFO comes from a woman who was a volunteer Air Raid Warden. She lived like many others, in fear of another Japanese attack. Nothing, however, could prepare her for what she so clearly witnessed the night of the giant UFO. Shaken awake by a call from her supervisor, she was briefed on the situation. Living not far fromSanta Monica, she was told the object was close enough for her to seefrom her window. Peeking out of her window, she was shocked at the sightof the massive UFO above. She described the sight as follows: ""It was huge! It was just enormous! And it was practically right over my house. I had never seen anything like it in my life!"" she said. ""It was just hovering there in the sky and hardly moving at all."" ""It was a lovely pale orange and about the most beautiful thing you\'ve ever seen. I could see it perfectly because it was very close. It was big!""   ""They sent fighter planes up and I watched them in groups approach it and then turn away. There were shooting at it but it didn\'t seem to matter.""""It was like the Fourth of July, but much louder. They were firing like crazy but they couldn\'t touch it.""""I\'ll never forget what a magnificent sight it was. Just marvelous. And what a gorgeous color!"" she said As the giant UFO moved away, things began to get back to normal, as normal as things could get, considering the times. The military clampdownon Japanese citizens, and security restrictions on its native populace madethis an unusual time. Had it not been for America being at war, news ofthis event would have gained more momentum. The lesson to be learnedfrom this is simply that we must be ready at all times to defend our country,and our globe from any invading force that would take our freedom as we knowit from us.

1946, ,"['The Legends of UFO Crashes at Spitzbergen, Norway, 1946 & 1952There have been numerous legends about UFO crashes; some of them have quite a bit of documentation and eyewitness testimony. Others are based mostly on legend and folklore.Two of these crashes alleged occurred in or near Spitzbergen, Norway. However, there is just not enough verifiable evidence to support either of these events, and here are the reasons:1946 Spitzbergen UFO CrashThe 1946 case, more than anything else, is memorable for its characters. The legend goes something like this; In 1946, General James H. Doolittle was sent to Sweden by the Shell Oil Company, supposedly to investigate the mystery of the ""Ghost Rockets."" Why an oil company would investigate UFOs is beyond my understanding; unless they felt they could strengthen their profits somehow.Somehow, Doolittle supposedly wound up in Spitzbergen. There are a number of Internet sites which claim that there was a short-lived article published in America of a UFO crash in the Norwegian city about this time. Some people claim to have seen the article. The really odd thing about the tale of this case is what does Doolittle have to do with anything, since he is only mentioned as being in the area, and that is the end of his involvement.The only redeeming part of this particular case is that it was reported by Dorothy Kilgallen, celebrity for her years  appearing on the ""What\'s My Line?"" TV game show.  She claimed that someone in the upper echelon of the British government informed her that a UFO had crashed near Spitzbergen, and was under investigation by the British and American military. Supposedly, this informant was Lord Mountbatten. Some investigators claim that since no mention of the name Spitzbergen was found in the reports, that the location\'s mention was to cover up a crash in Great Britain. A crash in Great Britain during the same time period has no basis in fact either.In addition to being a game show regular, Kilgallen also was a journalist of a sort, having written ""gossip columns,"" but she also was well known for covering hard current events. She had covered the headline-grabbing Lindbergh kidnapping story. In the 1950s, she had covered one of the top stories of her time, the Sam Sheppard murder trial. Her last real claim to fame was in the 1960s when she got an interview with Lee Harvey Oswald killer, Jack Ruby. This interview was carried by the ""Los Angeles Examiner.""  She told friends that she had information that would ""break the case wide open."" On 8th November, 1965, Dorothy Kilgallen was found dead in her New York apartment. She was fully dressed and sitting upright in her bed. The police reported that she had died from taking a cocktail of alcohol and barbiturates. The notes of her interview with Ruby and the article she was writing on the case had disappeared. Luckily, she had given a friend a draft of her interview. Kilgallen was probably fearful for her own life, since several other writers who had worked on the Oswald / Ruby case had died under ""unusual circumstances.""Kilgallen\'s reputation and notoriety was the only thing that kept the weak story of the Spitzbergen crash of 1946 alive. The last hope of further research into the Norwegian crash died along with her, as her sources were never verified.Spitzbergen 1946 written by B J Booth1952 Spitzbergen UFO CrashThe other Spitzbergen crash story first appeared in the German newspaper “Saarbrücker Zeitung” in June 1952. The article, entitled ""Auf Spitzbergen landete Fliegende Untertasse"", was soon picked up by several other German newspapers, with many of them citing “The Stuttgarter Tagerblatt” as the original source. The story was that jets of the Norwegian Air Force spotted a crashed UFO while flying over Spitzbergen on maneuvers. The craft was disc-shaped with a series of jets around the rim of the disc to make it spin. According to the first article about the crash, the craft was an unmanned, remote-controlled vehicle with Russian writing on the controls, but as the story was embellished with each retelling, it soon acquired seven alien crewmen who were burned to death in the crash. Spitzbergen 1952 written by Loy Lawhon']"
1948, ,"['1948, The Aztec UFO CrashIn 1950, controversial author Frank Scully released the book, ""Behind the Flying Saucers.""This effort, written during the beginnings of UFO awareness in the United States, was considered to contain fabricated, or sensationalized accounts of four UFO crashes. One of the accountscovered an alleged crash at Aztec, New Mexico in 1948, only a brief period of time after thefamous Roswell incident.Scully\'s information came largely from a mysterious Dr. Gee. Depending on which commentaryyou read, the identity of this physician is attributed to either a real doctor, or a fictitiousperson who was composed of elements of several different witnesses. Scully described the Azteccrash as that of a craft which was measured at exactly 99.99 feet in diameter, covered by a material which resembled a light weight,  shiny metal that possessed incredible strength anddurability. It seems that nothing on this earth could penetrate or damage the hull of this craftfrom another world.The disc shaped craft had large metallic rings revolving around a central core, which wassupposedly the control bridge of the object. The hull of the craft contained no apparent seams, rivets, or any hint of the material being pieced together.As the story goes, the investigatingteam gained access to its interior by the use of a long pole which they pushed through a portholein the saucer. A knob was engaged which opened a previously hidden door. Once inside, theteam found 16 small humanoid beings, all dead, their bodies charred from fire. The aliens heightwas reported as 36-42 inches. The exterior of the craft was not damaged. The inside showedthat the craft was put together with a framework of grooves and pins.The craft and the alien bodies were allegedly sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Othersupporting evidence of the Aztec crash was said to have surfaced in 1987 from one WilliamSteinman, but his sources were never verified. Steinman asserted that the crash occurred onMarch 25, 1948, and was verified by three different radar stations. Steinman\'s account listed14 dead aliens instead of 16. Until supporting evidence of Scully\'s or Steinman\'s accountcan be obtained, the Aztec crash story remains an unsolved mystery.(B J Booth)', 'The Chiles/Whitted Sighting 1948A classic UFO event that has all but been forgotten is the Chiles-Whitted sighting which unfolded over Montgomery, Alabama on July 24 1948. This case was one of the very first reports of a large UFO officially made by commercial airplane pilots. The experience was a one of a kind for the two seasoned pilots, Captain Clarence S. Chiles, and co-pilot John B. Whitted. While flying an Eastern Airlines DC-3 from Houston, Texas to Atlanta, Georgia they encountered a huge cigar-shaped UFO which barely missed them. This extraordinary event transpired while the DC-3 was cruising 5,000 feet above the city of Montgomery, Alabama.The first part of their journey was a pleasant, uneventful one until 2:45 A.M. Their relaxed cruising mode was suddenly interrupted by the sight of what seemed to be a dullish-red glowing object, directly in their flight path. Still at a distance, the two pilots first impression was that they were looking at a jet, unreported, and coming right at them! The glowing object barely missed them, passing on their starboard side at a distance of about 1,000 feet, according to Chiles. Whitted would later estimate the distance at somewhat more than Chiles\' guess.The two pilots both agreed that the object had no wings or tail section. Both also agreed seeing at least two rows of windows from which appeared a glowing like ""burning magnesium."" The object had a pointed nose section, and there was a ""bluish glow"" running on it\'s belly from nose to it\'s end. Out of it\'s rear end, an ""orange-red"" exhaust was seen by the two unnerved crewmen. This so-called emission was as long again as the object\'s body. Both pilots were also in agreement that the object\'s length was approximately that of a B-29 bomber, though somewhat thicker.Captain Chiles\' first reaction was to turn his DC-3 off to the left, as the object seemed to be coming slightly to his right. Both pilots clearly witnessed the oncoming craft do an abrupt pull-up, just after missing them. Only Whitted was able to view the object as it seemed to momentarily disappear after making a rapid vertical ascent. When asked later to elaborate on his description, he added, ""the object vanished instantaneously after its sharp pull-up."" The unusual object and it\'s dash at the DC-3 was fully reported to Eastern officials and Project Sign.Some further details were made available in this report. The two pilots stated that ""no disturbance was felt from airwaves, nor was there any wash or mechanical disturbance when the object passed."" Other witnesses would later disagree with this statement, and in the Naval Intelligence Report of the incident, it is stated by at least one of the passengers that the ""DC-3 was rocked by the wash from the object."" Witnesses also describe a sound like that of a V-2 rocket. Most of the passengers were, fortunately for them, asleep at the time of the occurrence. Clarence McKelvie, who was assistant editor of the American Education Press at Columbus, Ohio stated, ""I saw no shape or form. It was on the right side of the plane, and suddenly I saw this strange, eerie streak out of my window. It was very intense, not like lightning or anything I had ever seen before.""Chiles, Whitted, and McKelvie were not the only observers of this strange sight that morning. Several witnesses from Robbins Air Base, near Macon, Georgia stated they saw an object of the same description about 1/2 hour before the DC-3 sighting. The object was reported as travelling in a southerly direction at a high rate of speed. An official government investigation ruled out the possibility of a conventional aircraft after tracing flight records of 225 civilian and military flights that morning. Private debunkers, with no consideration of the facts, wrote the sighting off as an illusion due to temperature inversions, and then later assigned the sighting to a meteor. Project Sign would agree on the meteor theory, but in usual fashion, added that the description of the object and it\'s maneuvers did not match that of a meteor. This near-collision is still listed under the ""unexplained"" category.', 'Lt. Gorman\'s Dogfight with a UFO, 1948One of the early ""classics"" of UFO history involved Lieutenant George F. Gorman of the North Dakota Air National Guard, who said he had a twenty-seven minute ""dogfight"" with a UFO in the skies above Fargo.Date: October 1, 1948-Location: Fargo, North Dakota Gorman, then manager of a Fargo construction company, told this story to Air Force investigators: On the night of October 1, 1948, he had been on a cross-country flight with his squadron. Upon return to Hector airport in Fargo, he elected to log some night flying time, so he remained airborne after the other planes had landed. He had circled his F-51 over the lighted football stadium and around the city and was preparing to land about 9 P.M. The control tower cleared him to land, advising him about a Piper Cub in the vicinity - the only other plane - and he could see the light aircraft outlined plainly about 500 feet below him. What appeared to be the taillight of a plane passed him on the right, but the tower insisted they knew of no other planes in the area. Gorman informed the tower that he was going to investigate the other aircraft and pulled his F-51 up and out toward the moving light. He closed to within about 1,000 yards and took a good look at the object. ""It was about six to eight inches in diameter, clear white, and completely round without fuzz at the edges [i.e., sharp and clear]. It was blinking on and off. As I approached, however, the light suddenly became steady and pulled into a sharp left bank. I thought it was making a pass at the tower. I dived after it and brought my manifold pressure up to sixty inches but I couldn\'t catch up with the thing. It started gaining altitude and again made a left bank, I put my F-51 into a sharp turn and tried to cut the light off in its turn. By then we were at about 7,000 feet. Suddenly it made a sharp right turn and we headed straight at each other. Just when we were about to collide, I guess I got scared. I went into a dive and the light passed over my canopy at about 500 feet. Then, it made a left circle about 1,000 feet above, and I gave chase again.""Gorman said he cut sharply toward the light, which was once more coming at him. When collision again seemed imminent, the object shot straight up into the air in a steep climb-out, disappearing overhead. Gorman again attempted to pursue it but his plane went into a power stall at about 14,000 feet, and the object was not seen again. It was then 9:27 P.M. Gorman was so shaken by the encounter that he had difficulty handing his plane, although he was a veteran pilot and a flying instructor during World War II. He had noticed no sound, odor, or exhaust trail from the object during the ""dogfight,"" and no deviation on his instruments. At times during the chase, he had pushed the F-51 to full power, sometimes reaching 400 mph. He described the object as round and somewhat flattened. In the airport control tower, traffic controllers Lloyd D. Jensen and H. E. Johnson also saw a strange light near the airfield: ""After passing to the east of the airport it seemed to take a northwest heading, The object seemed to be at about 2,000 feet and appeared to be traveling at quite an excessive speed compared to a Piper Cub that was east of the field at the time. No definite outline could be identified. Both objects [the UFO and the Piper Cub] were sighted at the same time.""Jensen said that through binoculars he sighted, ""an object or a light traveling at a high rate of speed, apparently on a southwest heading. The F-51 [Gorman\'s plane] was some distance behind and the object was traveling fast enough to increase the spacing between itself and the fighter. The object appeared to be only a round light, perfectly formed, with no fuzzy edges or rays leaving its body. The edges were clear cut. No other shape was observed. The main identifying characteristic was the high rate of speed at which it was apparently traveling.""The pilot of the Piper Cub, Dr. A. E. Cannon, and his passenger, Einar Nielson, also witnessed the swiftly moving light while in radio communication with the tower: ""While circling the football field at NDAC at 1,600 feet, Fargo tower advised us that there was an F-51 in the air and a few moments later asked us who the third plane might be,""Cannon said, ""We had noticed the 51 and when we were over the north side of Hector field going west, a light, seemingly on a plane, passed above and to the north, moving very swiftly toward the west. At first we thought it was the 51, but we then saw the light of the 51 higher and move over the field. We landed on Runway 3, taxied to the administration building, and went up to the tower and listened to the calls from the 51, which seemed to be trying to overtake the plane or lighted object, which then went southwest and over the city. The object was moving very swiftly, much faster than the 51. We tried to get a better view with a pair of binoculars, but couldn\'t follow it well enough.""In a statement to Major D. C. Jones, commander of the 17th Fighter Squadron at Hector airport, Gorman said he was convinced that there was ""thought"" behind the maneuvers: ""I am also convinced that the object was governed by the laws of inertia because its acceleration was rapid but not immediate, and although it was able to turn fairly tight at considerable speed, it still followed a natural curve.""The object could outturn and outspeed the F-51, he said, and was able to attain a much steeper climb and to maintain a constant rate of climb far in excess of the F-51. ""When I attempted to turn with the object, I blacked out temporarily due to excessive speed,"" Gorman stated. ""I am in fairly good physical condition and I do not believe there are many, if any, pilots who could withstand the turn effected by the light and remain conscious.""George F. Gorman retired from the Air Force in 1969 with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and was then living in Texas. B J Booth', '1948, The Death of Thomas MantellIn more recent years, additional information has come forward. Captain James F. Duesler, who was one of several military officers at Godman, was retired and living in England. In 1997, he stated that he and several other officers actually saw the gigantic UFO hovering over Godman field that day. Duesler, who was a pilot and crash investigator, stated, ""The UFO was a strange, gray-looking object, which looked like a rotating inverted ice cream cone."" Shortly after the crash, Duesler visited the site, and made these observations, ""The wings and tail section had broken off on impact with the ground, and were a short distance from the plane, he recalled. There was no damage to the surrounding trees and it was obvious that there had been no forward or sideways motion when the plane had come down. It just appeared to have ""belly flopped"" into the clearing. ""There was very little damaged to the fuselage, which was in one piece, and no signs of blood whatsoever in the cockpit. ""There was no scratching on the body of the fuselage to indicate any forward movement and the propeller blade bore no telltale scratch marks to show it had been rotating at the time of impact, and one blade had been embedded into the ground. ""The damage pattern was not consistent with an aircraft of this type crashing at high speed into the ground. Because of the large engine in the nose of the plane, it would come down nose first and hit the ground at an angle. Even if it had managed to glide in, it would have cut a swath through the trees and a channel into the ground. None of these signs were present.""All indications were that it had just belly-flopped into the clearing. I must admit, I found this very strange."" To further debunk the ""Venus"" theory, astronomical records indicated that the planet was only 33 degrees above the horizon at the time of the incident, thus totally eliminating it from the case. The Air Force, embarrassed by the ""Venus"" theory falling through, now searched for another ""worldly"" explanation for the object observed that day. After discovering that Naval research was sending up the enormous ""Skyhook"" balloons, the Air Force had their alternate solution. This theory was also soon aborted after discovering that no balloon was launched, or could have been in the skies that day. The UFO theory received even more credence after Mantell\'s death. On January 8, residents of Clinton, North Carolina, reported a cone-shaped object moving through the skies at incredible speeds, and on February 1, a large metallic UFO was seen emitting an orange light near the ground at Circleville, Ohio. Whatever happened on the day that Thomas Mantell crashed his plane, it is certain that it was not a weather balloon, and it was not Venus, or any other planet. Could it have been a visitor from another planet, or another dimension? written by B J Booth']"

Curious,  he drove his tractor over for a closer look. He initially suspected that it was perhaps a fuel tank or something from a plane. As he walked up to it he could tell it was slightly off the ground, but wasn’t sure how it was suspended there, whether on some sort of legs or whatever. He described it as oblong shaped, resembling an egg, and that it was approximately 20 feet long, 4 feet high, and 15 or 16 feet wide. He stated that he thumped it, even kicked it. He determined that it was definitely metallic, with an aluminum color. The surface was smooth, with no rivets or seams visible, and when he touched it he detected no vibration, there was no sound, nor was there any sensation of heat or anything else out of the ordinary. Then two men, both about 4 foot tall, came out from underneath it, and they had what resembled a metal tray about a foot square that was filled with alfalfa, roots, soil, leaves and brush. The men were dressed in some sort of white or metallic suits. No part of their body was showing. Wilcox said that for the first few minutes he didn’t say much of anything. He was frightened, and he suspected that someone was playing a trick on him. When asked what the beings first said to him, Wilcox stated that one of the beings seemingly told him “Don’t be alarmed, we have spoken to people before.” In a prepared statement Wilcox recalled, “Their voices did not sound like a voice I could describe. I could understand what was said but cannot tell whether they were speaking English or not.” Then they proceeded to ask him about what he was doing, asking for him to explain about the tractor, manure spreader, and manure itself. He claimed that it turned out that they were very interested in organic substances as Mars (where they allegedly claimed to be from) was rocky and not fit for growing anything. Wilcox said he answered their questions for two hours. During that time he learned that they had been watching him for sometime. Wilcox said he asked the beings if he could go with them. They turned down his request, stating that their atmosphere would be too thin. They added that they avoided congested areas on earth because of automobile fumes, as it seemingly interfered with the performance of their vehicles. They preferred operating in areas where the air was clean. Meanwhile, the strange men, who had approached within a few feet of Wilcox, seemed interested in farming practices, and when Wilcox mentioned how he used fertilizer, they wanted to know about it. He offered to get them a bag of fertilizer to take with them, but they did not want to wait around for him to do so. Soon the men got back into their craft which quietly rose into the air with a noise he described as comparable to a car motor idling. The UFO slowly glided off and then just disappeared from sight to the north, at an estimated distance of about 150 feet. Later that afternoon, Wilcox took a 75 pound bag of fertilizer and left it near a small tree near where the UFO had landed. When he checked the next morning he found the bag of fertilizer was gone. During their conversation, the little men allegedly told Wilcox astronauts John Glenn and Virgil Grissom and two Russian astronauts would die within a year, something to do apparently with exposure to the elements of space. Although Glenn is still alive and well, Grissom and two others died in the tragic Apollo capsule fire of January 27, 1967, and Russian astronaut Vladimir M. Komarov was killed when his capsule’s parachutes didn’t open upon re-entry on April 24, 1967, exactly three years after Wilcox was given the alien prediction. Psychiatrist Dr. Berthold E. Schwarz gathered much background information on this case and followed up with an extensive interview of Wilcox at his home on October 18, 1968. Dr. Schwarz was extremely impressed with Wilcox’s obvious background and evidence of stability, integrity, honesty, and intelligence.

Nothing untoward happened, although both he and his wife noticed an unusual aura in the atmosphere. There was a kind of electric charge in the air, though no storm came. Even nearby cows seemed upset by it. Some days later Mr Templeton got his photographs processed by the chemist, who said that it was a pity that the man who had walked past had spoilt the best shot of Elizabeth holding a bunch of flowers. Jim was puzzled. There had been nobody else on the marshes nearby at the time. But sure enough, on the picture in question there was a figure in a silvery white space suit projecting at an odd angle into the air behind the girl\'s back, as if an unwanted snooper had wrecked the shot. The case was reported to the police and taken up by Kodak, the film manufacturers, who offered free film for life to anyone who could solve the mystery when their experts failed. It was not, as the police at first guessed, a simple double exposure with one negative accidentally printed on top of another during processing. It was, as Chief Superintendent Oldcorn quickly concluded, just ""one of those things... a freak picture."" A few weeks later Jim Templeton received two mysterious visitors. He had never heard of MIBs: the subject was almost unknown in Britain then. But the two men who came to his house in a large Jaguar car wore dark suits and otherwise looked normal. The weird thing about them was their behavior. They only referred to one another by numbers and asked the most unusual questions as they drove Jim out to the marshes. They wanted to know in minute detail about the weather on the day of the photograph, the activities of local bird life and odd asides like that. Then they tried to make him admit that he had just photographed an ordinary man walking past. Jim responded politely, but nevertheless rejected their idea, at which they became irrationally angry and hustled themselves into the car, driving off and leaving him. The fire officer had to hike five miles across country to get home. source:by Landon Howell  Owner & Editor - juiceenewsdaily.comhttp://www.juiceenewsdaily.com/0305/news/ufo_sol.html', ' The Big Sur UFO Filming: 1964A Critical Analysis of the Curious Events at Vandenberg Air Force Base. By Bob Jacobs, Ph.D. It is a sad and curious fact that much of the literature surrounding the UFO phenomena appears in the highly sensationalized ""tabloids."" Once relegated solely to pulp newsprint this form of idiot journalism has now moved into television with personal ties like Geraldo Rivera, Morton Downey, Jr. and a growing number of other slime merchants. Owing to the prejudice toward this kind of journalism shared by intellectuals, academicians and the celebrities who frequently decry being victimized by the tabloids, such exposure has tended to desensitize the American Public to the potential seriousness of the UFO issue. Since tabloids seem to be written stylistically by and for the lunatic fringe, then UFOs are seen broadly as the purview of lunatics exclusively. If one wanted deliberately to denigrate an issue, to relegate it to trash heap of pop culture, one could not do so more completely than to insure that the issue falls into the hands of The Star or The National Enquirer or Geraldo Rivera! Perhaps a case could be made for the UFO evidence having been delivered over to garbage journalism by design as a method of discrediting it. We know, for example, that at the beginning of his involvement with the subject, the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, later Chairman of the Department of Astronomy at Northwestern University, was employed by the United States Air Force with Project Blue Book to ""debunk"" all ""flying saucer"" sightings. His famous ""Swamp Gas"" conclusion has lived in the popular mythos long after the good Doctor\'s formal recantation of it. And, in spite of some of the general popularizing of the subject in films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T., Johnny Carson, David Letterman and other television talk show heroes, still get comic mileage out of poking fun at UFO investigators, ""swamp gas and the frequent loonies who claim to be incarnate space ships or to own condos on Venus. If the tabloids were not paid off to run as many mislead- ins, bizarre stories on UFOs and UFO Fringies as possible, always making these tales appear to be from or about some dimwit in the hinter lands, then they may as well have been. Deliberate deception, Machiavellian conspiracy, coincidence or just the luck of the draw - whatever the reason, the resultant tabloid ""sleaze factor"" is a handicap for any scholar wishing to engage in research into what is, in fact, a fascinating and deliciously intricate field worthy of serious study. I am a scholar, a card-carrying Ph.D., and a university professor in a department of Journalism and Broadcasting. Some years ago I was an officer in the United States Air Force, the first officer in the photography career field, by the way, to be awarded the Air Force Guided Missile Insignia; the ""Missile Badge."" Those are facts. Another fact is that I have been a participant in an -official United States Government-ordered UFO cover-up. I\'ve been ridiculed by some of my colleagues in academia because in 1982 I wrote an article about this cover-up and it appeared in The National Enquirer. It was not my intention to become a tabloid writer then or now. The Enquirer turned out to be the only publication I could find which was interested in printing the article at all. Both academic and mainstream journals and periodicals turned it down cold over the period of nearly a year during which I submitted and resubmitted it. I was told by editor after editor that UFO stories weren\'t ""publishable."" I thought the story was important then. That\'s why I let a tabloid publish it. I still think it\'s important. That\'s why I responded to the invitation to write it for this journal. So much for preamble about the press. BIG SUR BACKGROUND:Six years then, after it first broke, here is my report on what we photographed at Big Sur along with some of what has happened since 1982 in plain, unheroic, non-sensational, unexpurgated and non-tabloidized English. I earned the ""Missile Badge"" for making a ""significant contribution to America\'s Missile and Space Program"" so the citation read, while I was Officer-in-Charge of Photo-optical Instrumentation in the 1369th Photographic Squadron at Vandenherg Air Force Base, California from May, 1963 to May, 1966. My work in establishing a long range tracking site at Big Star, California in large part is what convinced the Air Force to give me that cherished award. The circumstances that took me to the ""Missile Badge"" ceremony as well as to that lovely and mysterious bulge of California coastline known as the Big Star ended up changing my mind about a number of things, including the nature of our government, the nature of my personal belief systems and the nature of the universe. It began with a man named Kingston A. George. ""King"" George had the title of Operations Analyst for Headquarters, 1st Strategic Aerospace Division. The engineers, civilian and military, whose job it was to evaluate the instrumentation photography which we provided on every missile launch down the Western Test Range, were unhappy, he said. Shooting tracking footage from Vandenberg only provided a look up the ""tailpipe"" of the missile. What George said they wanted was a side look at all stages of powered flight. This side-look was not possible from anyplace on the base. Because of the tortured California coastline, such a view was possible from one spot. Big Star. Topographically, Big Sur is both north and west of Vandenberg. We reasoned that we might get the shot the engineers wanted if we could get high enough to provide both a line-of-sight to the base and to put us well above the offshore fog bank which blankets the California shoreline much of the year. Because of the 124 mile distance from Vandenberg to Big Sur, the final things needed were a lens with a very long focal length, a recording device capable of enhancing the image and a tracking system on which to mount them. According to George, such a device was built and ready to go. It was the Boston University telescope, owned by the Air Force Eastern Test Range (AFETR) at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida and under the direction of Mr. Walter Manning in the Aerospace Sciences Division at AFETR. The optical segment of the device was a folded Gregorian telescope with a 24- inch diameter objective mirror and a 240-inch focal length. The lens apparatus was sealed from the air and insulated against heat and cold. A set of Barlow extenders could yield effective focal lengths of  from 480 to 2,400 inches. (The normal focal length lens for a 35mm camera is about two inches!) The light sensing element of the instrument was an image orthocon (television) tube. The I.O. could enhance the optical image, convert it to a series of electrical signals and display on a Kinescope where it was photographed with 35mm motion picture film. Because the I.O. had remarkable low noise, the gain could be ""cranked quite high to record very low light level objects. Such a device could record sources of light emission or reflection which were tens of times too weak for detection by other photographic methods. The B.U., as it was called, was ideal for the purpose. One of the primary goals of our mission, according to George, was to provide information on the ""minute events folIowing propellant depletion - at distance of from 300 to 800 nautical miles. (italics mine) If we could find a level place accessible to the B.U. (not easy, considering that the scope with its tracker was just a little smaller than a conventional moving van and had be hauled by a heavy duty, cross- country type diesel truck) and see the missile through the haze well enough to lock in on it with the tracking mount, we still had one problem left. Engineering sequential photograph is of little use to the viewer without the addition of timing marks on th film. This time code received from Wheeling, West Virginia tagged each individual frame of film with a reference point in real time to the moment of engine ignition and launch. The coded pips of light were recorded on the sound track area of the film by an exciter lamp driven by the signal from WWV. On the base, timing signals were sent to the cameras by hardlines from the blockhouse. Running a line to Big Sur with the necessary amplifiers would have been to costly, particularly for what was only a feasibility test. We had to try some thing else. The solution was really very simple. On June 10,1964 I lead a group of people to the area I had discovered earlier near Anderson Peak at an elevation of  3,400 feet on a Forest Service fire trail, 9 miles into the woods and uphill from Highway 1 in Big Sur. With me on that sunny summer day were my NCOIC, Chief Master Sergeant Ike N. Davis, Jr., NCOIC of my Tracking Section, Staff Sergeant Jules Devine, Kingston A. George, with a Technical Sergeant Porter from 1st STRATAD and a Mr. Paulson from Patrick Air Force Base at Cape Kennedy. All of us agreed that the truck could certainly pull the B.U. up to this site with no trouble. Could we now get timing pips to it? We had with us that day a portable radio transceiver which we used at Vandenberg to communicate from my office to the mobile vehicles and our tracking sites on base. At Vandenberg I had Airman First Class Joseph Williams standing by. He had wired the output of one of the timing signals to an identical transceiver to the to the one I had. At my command he activated the radio and transmitted flawless timing signals to us at Big Sur, just as we had in a test weeks earlier. All that was necessary with the B.U. would be to patch-in our receiver to its timing signal input on the 35mm motion picture camera. Timing was no problem. There was happiness on the site and my ""Missile Badge"" was assured rhat day. On August 28,1964, I lead a convoy up the Pacific Coast Highway through Pismo Beach, past Hearst Castle at San Simeon and into what would be history. Technical Sergeant Thomas Dodd was my NCOIC for the remote site. He would operate our standard M-45 tracking mount with conventional 35mm Mitchell film cameras to compare with the results of the B.U. Telescope. A1C Joseph Williams was along to handle communications and timing. A1C Daryl Winters was also along. As a sad sideline, Winters would become the first and only Air Force photo man to be killed in action in Vietiian a little over two years later. Our Air Force troop camped at the preselected fire trail turnout near the summit of Anderson Peak, set up our M-45 and waited. On August 31, 1964 the B.U. Telescope arrived on site with its truck and its caravan of people for a 30-day test period. Walt Manning was with it along with a crew of three operators and one supervisor. We were also joined by two people from Vandenberg: Chief Warrant Officer Guy M. Spooner from the Operations Section of the 1369th and Major Florenz J. Mansmann from 1st STRATAD. With a celebratory air, the B.U. was set in place and made ready to perform. Mansmann and Spooner went back to Vandenberg. The rest of us settled in to prepare for the first of what could be a total of 11 launches from the base during the 30 day test. Nine of these would be photographed through a major portion of powered flight by both the B.U. Telescope operating with effective focal lengths ranging from 1200 inches to an average of 720 inches, and with the conventional cameras and shorter lenses of the 1369th\'s M-45 mount. THE INCIDENT:One of these launches would inspire an official government cover-up and provoke an investigation and search for the filmed record which goes on to this day. Here is what happened. To the best of my recollection and based on sketchy records -  the date of the event was most probably either September 2nd, 3rd, or 15th, 1964 The launch was of an Atlas missile. It was an Atlas-F as I recall strongly, but it may possibly have been an Atlas.D. The flight was in support of the Nike-Zeus objectives. Nike Zeus was one of the United States\' projects to develop an anti-missile missile. This particular mission was part of a test of an enemy radar-defeating system. The whole program in hindsight seems very primitive, possibly futile and even a bit silly. Nearly a quarter of a century ago in 1964 it was deadly serious business. At the Big Sur tracking site we were ready to go as the countdown from Vandenberg progressed loud and clear on our radio. At the call of ""ignition.... liftoff"" all cameras rolled and scanned to the southeast for something to photograph. ""There it is!"", I shouted out as the Atlas leaped through the snow-white coastal fog blanket and both tracking mounts homed-in on the majestic ""bird"" in flight. The big Atlas could not have been more clean, clear and majestic We were ""Go"" for the operation. The magnification of the B.U. was truly impressive. The exhaust nozzles and lower third of the Atlas missile literally filled the frame at this distance of over 100 nautical miles. With one tracking mount operator on azimuth and one on elevation working completely manually, it was not easy to keep the image centered in the early stages of flight. As the nosecone package approached T + 400 seconds, sufficient angle of view had been established that we were literally locked down with the whole inflight package centered in the frame. No one on the site was watching the screen by this point. Our mission to provide the engineers with a side look at three stages of powered flight had been accomplished and we were a very happy bunch, congratulating each other and letting the film run out in the 35mm motion picture camera focused on the Kinescope. I took the cans of exposed film and headed down the coast to Vandenberg and our laboratory. Processing of the film would occur that night and the results would be ready for viewing the next day. MEN IN GREY:I was back at my desk enjoying the feeling of accomplishment from the Big Stir expedition when I was called by Major Mansmann, who asked me to come right away to his office at the Headquarters building. When I arrived, I found a movie projector set up in the office and a group of people waiting. Among these I recall two men in plain grey suits who spoke little and watched me intently as the lights were dimmed and the film played on a bright screen. (Mansmann has since stated that there were actually three men present.) It was a surprise and a delight for me to be seeing the kinescope recording from Big Sur after all the months of planning and weeks of work. I was quite amazed and very pleased with the quality, especially at the distance involved as we could make out quite plainly the separated nosecone, the radar experiment and the dummy warhead all sailing along beautifully about 60 miles straight up from planet Earth and some 300 to 500 nautical miles down range. As we neared the end of the camera run, Mansmann said, ""Watch carefully now, Lieutenant ant Jacobs."" At that point the most remarkable vision of my life came on the screen. Another object flew into the frame from left to right. It approached the warhead package and maneuvered around it. That is, this ... ""thing""...flew a relative polar orbit around our warhead package which was itself heading toward the South Pacific at some 18 thousand miles an hour! As the new object circumnavigated our hardware, it emitted four distinct bright flashes of light at approximately the 4 cardinal compass points of its orbit. These flashes were so intense that each ""strike"" caused the I.O. tube to ""boom"" or form a halo around the spot. Following this remarkable aerial display the object departed the frame in the same direction direction from which it had come. The shape of the object was that of a classic ""flying saucer."" In the middle of the top half of the object was a dome. From that dome, or just beneath it, seemed to issue a beam of light or which caused the flashes described. Subsequently the warhead malfunctioned and tumbled out of suborbit hundreds of miles short of its target. This ... unidentified flying ... ""thing"" had apparently ""shot down"" an American dummy atomic warhead! The lights came on and Major Mansmann said, ""Lieutenant Jacobs, were you or any of your people fooling around up there at Big Sur? ""No sir,"" I answered honestly. I was shaking with excitement. ""Then tell me ... what the Hell was that?"" I looked Major Mansmann straight in the eye. ""It looks to me like we got a UFO,"" I said. There was a stifling silence among the men in grey, civilian suits who continued to stare at me. Major Mansmann gave them what I can only describe as a ""let me handle this"" look. COVER-UP:""Well,"" he smiled cordially, ""let\'s just say it never happened. You are to say nothing about this footage to anyone. As far as you and I are concerned, this never took place, you understand?"" I looked at the men in the grey suits. They were not smiling. I felt hot and anxious. I was sweating badly. I think I just sat for a minute looking blankly at Major Mansmann. I had just seen the most fantastic event of my life. It etched a path in my memory as deep as the one put there almost a year earlier when President John F. Kennedy had been shot to death in Dallas. I wanted more than anything to see it again, to study it under a magnifier, to analyze the pictures frame by frame. Major Mansmann did smile, nicely. ""I don\'t need to remind you of the seriousness of a security breach, do I Lieutenant?"", he asked. ""No, sir,"" I replied. ""Good,"" he said,  motioning for me to stand. I stood.   He walked me to the door, speaking confidentially. ""What you just saw did not take place,"" he repeated. ""It never happened.""   I looked at him once more. Something flickered way back deep in his eyes as he again looked at the men in grey then back to me.   ""But ... if at some time in the future,"" Florenz Mansmann said finally, ""you are pressed by someone about this and you can\'t get out of answering, just tell them ... tell them it was flashes from laser tracking, O.K.?""   And with that, I was ushered out the door and into over a decade of silence on the subject. Never mind that in 1964 we did not have laser tracking, nor did we or any other power on Earth have spacecraft capable of flying circles around a suborbital capsule. I tried to sublimate the whole incident out of loyally and respect for Florenz Mansmann whom I liked a great deal. While I did not talk about the event with anyone. I did begin a period of intense research into the UFO phenomena.   My research intercst in the field continues to the present. Of particular fascination is the relationship of the press to the UFO. This great Liberal bastion of free enquiry, this body of muckrakers which prides itself so highly on prodding and upsetting political figures, has played very prettily  into the hands of those same government minions who wish to obfuscate the whole field of discovery, discussion and debate about the most perplexing and possibly most important scientific conundrum in the history of our species. While chasing after Pulitzer Prizes for such relatively petty mischief as political dirty tricks at Watergate, or poor old Gary Hart and his happy harlots or the hapless Dan Quayle and his colorless, but merely mediocre background, The Press has persistently missed one of the really imperative stories of our time.   GOES PUBLIC:  I told my small portion of it first, tentatively, on a late night talk show which I hosted in Eureka, California in 1973 on station KFMl-FM. The response I got to my revelation was almost as astonishing as had been the event itself. My program director, Richard Van Pelt, came forth to tell his own tale of a CE3K which happened to him while he was an Air Force Security NCO in Iceland 20 years earlier. A university physics professor at California State University, Humboldt who had worked on the H-bomb project came forth to tell about his firm belief in the extraterrestrial nature of UFOs. Since then I have met a number of other people whom I respect, whom I know not to be ""fringies"" or cranks or crackpots, but who share common experiences with UFO sightings and encounters.  And, finally, in 1982, 1 decided that my story needed to be aired to a broader audience. Eighteen years had gone by. I could not get it out of my mind after all that time. Then, first in the trade journals, later in the popular press, there were hints of a new weapon system in the offing. It was some kind of satellite-smasher we were told. Soon we would hear President Reagan himself disrobe the rumors and give us Star Wars (SDI). There were the rumors of aircraft being built which were invisible to radar (some said to the human eye, as well!) ""Stealth,"" they were called. It is significant to recall that until very recently, the Air Force denied that they existed, too! There were persistent stories of something called Project Snowbird where American pilots were being shown how to operate captured (or donated) alien space craft Something about the Big Sur film seemed to be part of the overall pattern. I held back writing my story because of the Security angle until the truth occurred to me. There was no ""security breach"" in this story. The damn thing had never been ""Classified SECRET\' or anything else. I had been told simply that it ""NEVER HAPPENED""! Therefore, I was free to tell the story to whomever I pleased since it was about a non event officially.  I wrote my article. I shopped it around. In the end The National Enquirer published it. And as now retired Major Florenz J. Mansmann put it, ""Jacobs opened Pandora\'s Box.""  I was contacted by a variety of investigators, buffs, cranks, proponents and detractors alike. James Oberg, a frequent ""mouthpiece"" for certain NASA projects and self-styled UFO Debunker wrote to disparage my story and to ask provocatively, ""Since you obviously feel free to discuss top secret UFO data, what would you be willing to say about other top secret aspects of the Atlas warhead which you alluded to briefly ...?"" I told Mr. Oberg where to put his misplaced cynicism.  Mansmann, now a Ph.D. research consultant at Stanford and a farmer near Fresno, California was besieged with requests for information, and for his version of what happened. My respect and admiration for him was vindicated as he categorically verified my account.  CONCLUSIONS: Academicians first gather data, then postulate conclusions based on what they find. From what I have gathered first hand, (primary evidence), pieced together from Mansmann, from a fine researcher named Lee M. Graham), from contemplation, discussion and debate of the material, as well as from the Air Force position on this and other related matters, I have come to the following conclusions:  (1) What we photographed that September day in 1964 was a solid, three-dimensional, intelligently controlled flying device.  (2) It emitted a beam of energy, possibly a plasma beam, at our dummy warhead and caused a malfunction.  (3) This ""craft"" was not anything of which our science and technology in 1964 was capable. The most probable explanation of the device, therefore, is that it was of extraterrestrial origin.  (4) The flashing strikes of light we recorded on film were not from laser tracking devices. Such devices did not exist then aside from small scale, laboratory models.  (5) Most probably the B.U. Tele scope was brought out to California specifically to photograph this event which had been prearranged. That is, we had been setup to record an event which someone in our Government knew was going to happen in advance.  (6) What we photographed that day was the first terrestrial demonstration of what has come to be called S.D.I. or ""Star Wars."" The demonstration was put on for our benefit for some reason by extraterrestrials. It is this aspect of the event, not merely the recording of another ""flying Saucer"" which caused such consternation both on the part of Major Mansmann when he told me ""it never happened"" and on behalf of the government in its two and one half decade cover-up of the event and the record we made of it.  It is this defense-oriented aspect of the case which has caused investigators to run into stone walls in trying to track down my story. The Air Force has alternately denied that I was ever an officer, that I was ever stationed at Vandenberg, that I was OIC of Photo-optical Instrumentation in the 1369th Photographic Squadron, that there was a tracking site at or near Big Sur, California, that an Atlas-F, or for that matter, any other missile was launched on or about the date or dates I reported.  DOCUMENTATION:We have been able to verify through FOIA requests and my military records everything except the specific launch and the fact of its having been filmed We have been told first that there were no launches, then that there were launches but no malfunctions. Herewith, for the first time I present the documentation for a mission malfunction in an official unclassified Air Force document which has finally surfaced in my collection of aging papers and books.   ""King"" George gives us a quick sketch of the whole Big Sur project, tells us that ""Over the period of 30 days, from 31 August to 30 September, during which the Boston University telescope was ready to film launches, eleven flights were made from Vandenberg,"" that ""a final report will be forthcoming in a few weeks with a complete description of the system and the operations over the past several weeks,"" that ""a documentary film of about 30 minutes length containing several minutes of selected film clips will be assembled"" and that one powered flight anomaly was observed (italics mine), and the coverage of the flights has produced enough data to show that Big Sur photography could be an important adjunct to other instrumentation.""  It is not clear whether or not Kingston George was privy to the screenings of the Big Sur film which recorded the UFO. My suspicion is that he was one of those to whom Mansmann has admitted showing the film. His document, however, states clearly that a missile malfunctioned during the B.U. test period, now putting the final lie to the Air Force denials. That is my story. It is from my own experiences, recollections, records, and hands. You are free to interpret it as you like. As a footnote I need to comment, I suppose, on the cover-up. I do not believe that anyone is going to succeed in getting the film on an F.O.I.A. request. I have been asked to make such a request myself and refuse to do so. Eric Mishara, Lee Graham, T. Scott Crain, Jr. and others have done so and have run into the wall of futility. I don\'t believe that anyone can succeed in getting the film because the fact of its existence will have been completely expunged from the records by now. Investigators who encounter negative replies from the Air Force, from representatives who are at Vandenberg now are not necessarily being deceived deliberately. Nearly 25 years have passed and no one presently at the base has any personal recollection of the event, much less any official record of it. Consider the very limited number of people who saw the film in the first place and you will comprehend how simple it was to make it disappear. Finally, if the government did officially ""classify"" the film either back then or subsequently, then perhaps there were/are compelling reasons for it to have done so. As the B-2 ""Stealth"" Bomber has now been unveiled publicly at last, we can contemplate the rationale for having kept it ""classified"" for so long. At some point, when no harm can come from the information, perhaps the film for which I was responsible that long ago September day in the cool, clear mountains of Big Sur will be made public, along with the possibly awe some technological power which the images recorded on it represented. One significant fact remains. The experimental tracking site which I installed near Anderson Peak became a permanent location for missile tracking on the Western Test Range. Moved nearer the peak geographically and magnitudes better technically, it is there today. You see footage from it everytime a Space Shuttle reenters for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base. What else it records or has recorded and its ultimate purpose for being there is a matter for history, hopefully, to reveal. Bob Jacobs,Reprinted from the MUFON UFO Journal, Issue No. 249. ', ""Lynn, Massachusetts, June 15, 1964-Saucer Hovers above PavementThe 1973 UFO sighting of Lyndia MorelLyndia Morel, a masseuse at the Swedish Sauna in Manchester, New Hampshire, signed out from work at 2:45 A.M. on Friday morning, November 2, 1973. She stopped and had coffee with a friend, then stopped for gas and then headed for home in nearby Goffstown, about eight miles west of Manchester. As she reached the outskirts of Manchester on highway 114, she noticed a bright light in the sky. At first it was yellow, but then it flashed red and blue and green colors. She thought that was a bit odd, but she drove on, thinking it to be a planet. After driving about a mile, she noticed that it stayed in the same place in relation to her field of vision, but that it seemed to be getting brighter. As Lydia neared the intersection of highways 114 and 114A, she lit a cigarette. As she did, the light blinked out, but reappeared after she had gone though the intersection. It reappeared in the same spot, ahead and to the left of her. As she drove on to Goffstown and into the city, the light vanished and then reappeared twice more, seeming to be a little brighter each time. After she drove though Goffstown on highway 114, she was surprised to see the light reappear again, straight ahead of her, even brighter and closer than before. So much closer, in fact, that she could make out details. She could see that it was an orange and gold globe covered with hexagons like a honeycomb, with an oval window on the upper left. The red, green, and blue flashes were coming from somewhere near the center of the object, and she could hear a high-pitched sound. Lyndia later reported that she suddenly found that she was unable to remove her hands from the car's steering wheel. She felt that the object was taking control of her and the car and pulling them to itself. The speed of her car was increasing against her will as she passed Westlawn Cemetery. The object grew closer and closer. When it was only a few hundred feet away, Lyndia could see a figure in the window. She saw what she described as a smallish humanoid figure standing behind a console of some sort. The figure had a round, grayish head, a wrinkled face, a down turned slit of a mouth, and two large eyes with dark pupils. She felt that he was sending her a telepathic message to be unafraid. If she was, the message did not work, because Lyndia was terrified. Somehow, she was able to slow the car and turn into the driveway of a house just past the cemetery. She jumped out of the car and ran to the kitchen door of the house, ignoring a German shepherd dog that growled and barked at her. She pounded on the door and rang the bell and yelled for help as the UFO moved to a position across the street, hovering and watching her, still emitting that high-pitched sound. Finally, the residents, Mr. And Mrs. Beaudoin, came to the door. They opened the door to a terrified woman who was covering her ears and claiming that a UFO was after her. The Beaudoins could not see or hear anything, but Mrs. Beaudoin called the police. When Goffstown Officer Daniel Jubinville arrived, he found Lyndia's car in the driveway with the lights on and the motor still running. He went in and listened to Lyndia's story, noting in his report that she did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. As Walter Webb has noted, the planet Mars was near its brightest and was in the Western part of the sky where Lyndia saw the object. However, that does not explain the other events that she claimed occurred. Note also that this sighting occurred only about 100 miles from the site of the 1961 Betty & Barney Hill abduction event. source:www.about.comLoy Lawhorn "", 'Near Staunton, Virginia: December 21, 1964-Cone-Shaped Object At approximately 5:00 p.m. on the evening of December 21, as he drove east along Route 250 between Staunton and Waynesboro, Virginia, Horace Burns, a gunsmith in Harrisonburg, saw an immense cone-shaped object cross low over the highway ahead of him. It was moving in a north to south direction at a slow speed estimated to be about 15 mph. The point of the cone was tipped slightly forward in the object\'s line of flight. It crossed the highway approximately 200 feet ahead of Burns and settled in a meadow to the right of the road, landing gently, ""like a bubble."" At the moment the object crossed the highway, Burns\' car motor failed. The object settled in the field as he brought the car to a stop on the shoulder of the highway. Burns got out of the car to get a better look. ""It was 125 feet in diameter, at least, and 80 to 90 feet high,"" he later reported. Its circular, sloping sides rose toward the top in six large, concentric convolutions that decreased in diameter and were surmounted by a dome. The object was so large, Burns said, that when it crossed the road ahead of him it had more than filled the entire width of his windshield. In the gathering darkness, Burns could not make out with certainty the exact nature of the object\'s surface material but it gave the appearance of a dull, metallic finish. He saw no features such as windows, ports, doors, or seams on the object; however, extending around its base at a height of about six feet was a band of bluish-white light, sharply-edged and about 12 to 18 inches wide. The light was steady and did not flicker or dim. No landing gear was evident and the object seemed to rest lightly on the ground on a somewhat convexly curved undersurface.  Burns watched the object for from 60 to 90 seconds at a distance no greater than 150 yards when it suddenly rosestraight up to a height of several hundred feet and, emitting a soft ""whoosh"" like rushing air, took off in a northeasterly direction at an exceedingly high rate of speed, again with its top tilted slightly forward in the line of motion. It disappeared from view in a matter of seconds. Following its disappearance, Burns drove home and told his wife about his sighting, swearing he wouldn\'t tell another soul because ""they\'d think I\'m crazy."" However, a few days later, a local radio program announced the formation of a UFO investigations group at Eastern Mennonite College, under the direction of Dr. Ernest G. Gehman, a professor of German at the college. At his wife\'s urging, Burns got in touch with Gehman by way of the radio station to report his observation.  On December 31, Dr. Gehman traveled alone to the landing site and made a geiger counter test of the area. An extremely high reading was obtained, and was verified by the arrival of two DuPont research engineers who, having heard about the landing, had driven to the site the same day Dr. Gehman made his investigation. In fact, Dr. Gehman had been able to locate the landing spot (later verified by Burns) by the readings on his Geiger counter.  source:http://www.nicap.org/newlook/section_VI.htm', '1964, United Kingdom, The Warminster Thing (UFO) In the mid-1960s a sleepy Wiltshire town became the unlikely epicentre of a UFO phenomenon. Warminster, in West Wiltshire, became known globally for what was enigmatically called ""The Thing"". The Thing took many forms by those who claimed to have observed it between 1965 and 1977.The first sign of The Thing was during the Christmas of 1964, when residents heard a loud, unidentifiable whine. The strange sightings were reported in the Warminster Journal. Local journalist Arthur Shuttlewood was instrumental in making the phenomenon national news  and in one year more than 1000 sightings of unidentified flying objects were recorded. They continued to be seen on a regular basis between 1965 and 1977, and in many ways formed a key chapter of the 1960s . Although there have been few sightings in recent years, Warminster is still seen by many as synonymous with UFOs. With the army based on nearby Salisbury Plain, Warminster is well known as a military town. This gave rise to the theory that visitors from outer space could very well have been mistaken military aircraft.But believers shrugged off this theory believing that the military were one of the reasons Warminster had been chosen for visitations. Whatever the reason for the coming of The Thing, it has certainly put Warminster on the map.Also see  Warminster Revisitedsource:http://www.weirdwiltshire.co.uk/ufos/world.htmlhttp://www.weirdwiltshire.co.uk/ufos/']"
1993, ,"['1993-Flying Triangle seen over  RAF Cosford & Shawbury(There)... was a wave of sightings that occurred on the 30th and 31st of March, 1993. We had several hundred reports that came our way. Many of the witnesses were police. A lot of police in the southwest of the country, in Devon and Cornwall, saw something. Now, as with all of these big waves of sightings, quite a lot of the reports were fairly mundane, lights in the sky. But even so, it was quite late at night -- most of these reports were between, say, 1:00 and 1:30 in the morning -- and because there were police officers on night patrol, you\'re dealing with more than average recognition training, and people used to being out and about, and used to seeing lights and other things in the sky. Repeatedly, I heard the phrase, ""This was like nothing I\'d ever seen before in my life."" People were genuinely quite spooked by this. What was generally reported was two lights, flying in a perfect formation, with a third, much fainter light -- our old friend the flying triangle, really. The lights were described as being in a triangle formation. It\'s difficult to say, of course. It\'s quite possible they could have been three separate things flying in formation, but the impression from talking to witnesses was that this was a triangular craft with lights mounted on the underside, at the edges. The most interesting reports, of course, were the ones which occurred at close distance. There was a family in Staffordshire who apparently saw this thing so low -- and they described it as either triangular or diamond shaped -- that they leapt into their car and tried to chase it. They didn\'t succeed, although at one point they thought it was so low that it had actually come down in a field. It wasn\'t there when they got to it. They described a low, humming sound, a very low-frequency sound. They said you didn\'t just hear this sound, you felt it, like standing in front of a bass speaker. The really intriguing thing was that this object, whatever it was, then proceeded to fly over two military bases. It was seen by the guard patrol at RAF Cosford, about three or four people, [who] made an instant report of this, obviously because it had flown over their base. They checked radar. There was nothing on the screens, nothing at all, and there was nothing scheduled to fly. No military or civil aircraft should have been airborne in that area at all. They phoned the nearby base at RAF Shawbury, about 12 miles away from Cosford. The meteorological officer there took the call. He was a man with about eight years experience of looking into the night sky and then doing the weather report for the next day. So he knew his way around objects and phenomena. Now, to his absolute amazement, he saw a light in the distance, coming closer and closer. That light eventually resolved itself into a solid structured craft that he saw again flying directly over the base, but at much closer proximity than the guard patrol at Cosford had seen it. He estimated that the height of the object was no more than 200 feet. Its size, he said, was midway between a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and a Boeing 747. He heard the low hum, too. He had not spoken to any other witnesses, except the Cosford people, who I don\'t think had reported the sound. He reported this low-frequency hum. Perhaps most disturbingly of all, he reported this thing throwing a beam of light down at the nearby countryside and fields just beyond the perimeter fence at the base. And this light was tracking backwards and forwards, he said to me, ""as if it was looking for something."" The beam of light then retracted, and the craft moved off. It was traveling very slowly, I should say, probably no more than 20 or 30 mph. Then it gained a little bit of height, and then it just shot off to the horizon in little more than a second. Needless to say, that was a description I had come across many times in other UFO reports, the virtual hover to the high-Mach accelerations in an instant. I launched a full investigation. I made all the usual checks, trying to track down aircraft movement, satellite activity, airships, weather balloons, meteorites, etc., etc. I drew a blank -- with one exception -- and then put a report up the chain of command. The exception was a ballistic missile early warning sensor at RAF Fylingdales, in North Yorkshire. It is estimated that at some stage in the night there had been a rocket reentry of, I think, Cosmos 2238, which might have caused a very brief firework display in the high atmosphere. It\'s just possible that some of the vague lights-in-the-sky sightings might have been explained in that way, although Fylingdales didn\'t seem very sure on whether [the satellite re-entry] was actually going to be visible from the UK at all. But, clearly, it wouldn\'t explain the sighting of the family in Staffordshire and, most importantly of all, the direct overflight of the military bases, particularly the meteorological officer\'s report. He had obviously seen a structured craft. This to me really [refuted] any idea that these things are of no defense significance. You had a craft which, whatever it was, had penetrated our defense region. It wasn\'t on our radar, and we hadn\'t got our air defense fighters out. So whether it was extraterrestrial or not, there was something which we all should have been very concerned about. The debate got bogged down in the search for Aurora, the alleged hypersonic replacement to the SR-71 Blackbird. We were chasing our tails trying to find out whether there was such a thing. We were asking the Americans, ""Are you operating a prototype aircraft in our airspace?"" That, of course, was nonsense. You simply would not do that from a diplomatic and political point of view. It would undermine the entire structure of NATO if you were putting things through someone else\'s airspace, particularly a close ally, without seeking the proper diplomatic clearance. But we had to ask. And the Americans, having had similar reports, I guess, since the Hudson Valley wave [New York state, mid-1980s], had been quietly asking us if we had some large, triangular shaped object that could go from 0 to Mach 5 in a second. Our response was that we wished we did. This was the bizarre situation: that we were chasing the Americans, and the Americans were chasing us. Meanwhile, I suspected a third party was having a laugh!

Suddenly, they saw three silver balls in the sky over the school. These disappeared with a flash of light and then reappeared elsewhere. This happened three times and then they started to move down towards the school with one of them landing (or hovering) over a section of rough ground made up of trees, thorn bushes, and some brown-grey cut grass with bamboo shoots sticking up out of the ground. The children are not allowed in this area although it is adjacent to their playing field and is not fenced off, because of snakes, spiders and perhaps other harmful creatures. One can soon disappear from view while walking here, and there is only one very rough track used by tractors in an attempt to clear this area. There is a line of electricity pylons and according to one boy, the object followed along this line prior to landing. There is also some controversy as to whether the object landed on the ground or hovered above it. On Tuesday, 20th September, I went out to the school with a BBC reporter and their television equipment, as well as my son and Gunter Hofer, a young man who builds his own electrical equipment, a Geiger counter, a metal detector, and a magnetometer, to try and see if the object left any traces behind. The headmaster of the school is Mr. Colin Mackie, who was most co-operative, and although he had never been involved with UFOs or a believer in them, said that he believed the children had seen what they said they saw. I was able to interview about 10 or 12 older children and this was recorded for BBC television. One eyewitness, Barry D., said he had seen three objects flying over, with flashing red lights. They disappeared, and reappeared almost immediately, but somewhere else. This happened about three times. Then they came and landed near some gum trees; Barry said the main one (object) was about the size of his thumb nail held at arm's length. The reports were similar, although some children were more observant than others. The consensus of opinion was that an object came down in the area where they indicated, about 100 metres from where they were at the edge of the school playing field. Then a small man (approx 1 metre in height) appeared on top of the object. He walked a little way across the rough ground, became aware of the children and disappeared. He, or someone very like him, then reappeared at the back of the object. The object took off very rapidly and disappeared. The little man was dressed in a tight-fitting black suit which was 'shiny' according to one observant girl (11 years of age). He had a long scrawny neck and huge eyes like rugby balls. He had a pale face with long black hair coming below his shoulders. I had suggested to Mr. Mackie prior to visiting the school and before the children had been interviewed, that he let the children draw what they had seen and he now has about 30-40 drawings, some of which are very explicit and clear, although some are rather vague. The childrens' ages vary from 5/6 to 12 years. I have 22 photocopies of the clearer drawings as Mr. Mackie kindly allowed me to page through the pictures and choose those I wanted. Most of the descriptions are similar but some of the craft are very obviously 'flying saucers', and I wonder how many of these children have had access to the media. Others are crude but more or less in this saucer shape. The children vary in cultures: there are black, white, coloured and Asian children. One little girl said to me, 'I swear by every hair on my head and the whole Bible that I am telling the truth.' I could see the pleasure on her face when I told her that I believed her. The smaller children from 5-7 years were very frightened at the time and ran shouting 'Help me, help me.' When the older children asked why they were saying this, the reply was, 'He is coming to eat us.' I should think this applied more to the black African children who have legends of tokoloshies eating children. Their teachers were in a meeting and did not come out. When I queried the headmaster about this he said the children always shouted and yelled during their playtime and no one thought there was anything unusual going on. The only other adult available at the time was one of the mothers who was running the tuckshop. When the children came to call her, she did not believe them and would not come out: she was not prepared to leave the tuckshop with all the food and money. Gunter and the men thoroughly examined the ground around where the children had seen the object, but could get no reaction on the geiger counter or any other equipment. If the object was hovering perhaps nothing would show. I walked, on my own, along the electricity pylons for quite a away, caught up in thorn bushes, trampling blithely over snake holes and discarding all caution. I found no place where some object could have landed and pressed down the foliage. In fact, I should think the bamboo stumps would have been a deterrent. The day was hot, around 33 C (91F)... Dr John Mack was visiting Zimbabwe at the time of the event, and he spent two days at Ariel School with the children. He also spoke to the Headmaster, Colin Mackie, the teachers and some of the parents. John and his fellow researcher, Dominique Callimanopulos, were able to get through to the parents and teachers and convince them that even if they did not believe the children, it was counter-productive to accuse them of lying. Listen and think about what they were saying, he advised. His particular interest in child psychiatry was also of great use during the questioning and many former hidden memories came to light, something John is sure to make public when he has had a chance to reassess his interviewing.""]"

(B J Booth)Albany, NY Fox TV UFO CasePeter Davenport, Director, National UFO Reporting CenterExpert Certifies Object Genuine... Preliminary NUFORC statement regarding the footage captured by FOX 23 television in Albany, NY, on Sunday, October 20, 2002.At 07:30 hrs. (Pacific) on Monday morning, October 21, 2002, the National UFO Reporting Center received a telephone call from a television news reporter, Mr. Dan Bazile, with FOX 23 news (a Clear Channel Communication-owned station), who apprised us that one of their photographers had inadvertently captured brief footage of a very bizarre object streaking across the sky near Albany, NY.He described that one of their photographers had been out on Sunday afternoon, October 20th, photographing aircraft at a nearby airport, and that the peculiar object had been detected in the news studio when the footage was being examined at slow speed.From that first telephone conversation, NUFORC was not left with a clear understanding of the nature of the object and its appearance, but Mr. Bazile offered to forward to NUFORC still images from the tape. NUFORC offered to help identify the object, if possible, and to put the station in touch with photo analysts, who might be able to assist in further analysis.In a second conversation with Mr. Bazile on Tuesday morning, October 22, he apprised NUFORC that the original video tape of the object had been forcibly ""confiscated"" from the ""young photographer"" by ""four FBI agents,"" from the Albany, NY, FBI offices, a statement which now is in question. {or had been changed, B J} p> Mr. Bazile went on to describe how the agents had invited the photographer outside the station, and that the agents had then ""taken"" the ""original"" tape from the photographer, who had it on his person at the time of the meeting with the FBI personnel.When NUFORC suggested that such an act, in the absence of a court warrant, might be illegal, Mr. Bazile averred that he agreed with that assessment.However, he stated that the station still had in its possession several copies of the original tape.{Shortly after these events, I received my first report of this event. I was told that the video was briefly on the Fox 23 News station, but had been removed. This certainly got my attention.The video had made it\'s way to www.rense.com, and I tried to download it, which I did, but the file would not play. I subsequently received the video file from one of my sources, and immediately uploaded it to my domain in two formats, quicktime and real.When NUFORC asked Mr. Bazile whether FOX 23 was planning to do a news report on the incident with the FBI, he responded that the station was ""considering"" that possibility, but such a decision was out of his hands.He then stated that in order to answer that question, he would like first to speak with his ""supervisor"" about the matter, and that he would call back ""in a few minutes.""After approximately 45 minutes had elapsed, NUFORC telephoned FOX 23 and requested to be put in touch with Mr. Bazile. After a short period of time, he came on the line, but after only a very short conversation he said he would like to put his supervisor, Mr. Dave Brown, Station News Director for FOX 23, on the line.During our 7-minute conversation with Mr. Brown, he stated that a copy of the tape had been provided to the personnel from the FBI by his station voluntarily, because his station ""willingly co-operated with members of law enforcement."" He added that he personally had provided the video to the FBI, that it had not been ""taken"" by them, as had been suggested by Mr. Bazile. Mr. Brown stated that he had arrived at work on Sunday evening ""at about 8 or 9 o\'clock,"" and that FBI personnel had been photographed in the station while they watched the tape, and that that footage had been aired by the station on Sunday night as a news report. Mr. Brown implied that this fact illustrated that there had been no ""mystery"" surrounding the FBI\'s interest in the footage, and that, in his opinion, no impropriety surrounded the transfer of the tape to the FBI personnel.{I received the information on this video from one of my sources late on the 21st of October. Since then, I have done everything I could to find the video. This was the first post made on the event at the Fox 23 News.}ALBANY -- FOX TV News reported on October 21, 2002, that a spear shaped object was caught on film passing above Albany International Airport during daylight hours as a commercial aircraft landed at the airport. The spear shaped object was moving at high speed and could be mistaken for a missile, but none was known to have crashed. The FBI is attempting to determine the cause of the video sighting.When I saw the acronym FBI, I knew the information would be squashed. I ran a site search for more information and got this message:Overwhelming demand has crashed our video servers, so in the meantime here are stills from that video.If you sign up for FOX23 eNews Breaking News, an e-mail will be sent out as soon as video has been restored to our website.I followed their suggestion, and signed up on 10-22, so far nothing as of 10-26, 2:20 PM CDT.I also sent a request via email to the station news manager, so far no reply.Peter Davenport... cont\'dMr. Brown also added that he did not know whether the original tape had been provided to the FBI, or whether they had received a copy. However, he said that with digital tape, it really did not matter, since very little fidelity was lost in a copied tape.When asked how many representatives from the FBI had been present at the station on Sunday night, he said that he did not know, but there were at least two representatives from that office present.He said there might have been more, but he could not be certain, since ""there were so many people present in the station that night.""Mr. Brown closed the conversation with the statement that FOX 23 would not be devoting any more news coverage to the footage, suggesting that the story was now old news, and that, in his opinion, it did not warrant any further attention by his station.Following our conversation with Mr. Brown, NUFORC contacted the FBI offices in Albany [(518) 465-7551]. We spoke with Lisa Massaroni, a public affairs spokeswoman, who apprised us that to the best of her knowledge, the FBI office did have a copy of the tape, that their personnel were planning to analyze it, but that she did not know the status of the investigation.She directed us to her supervisor for any further questions, and added that he would be out of his office until October 24th.NUFORC also was contacted by a gentleman from Birmingham, AL, Mr. Brian Huff, a forensic video analyst, who had captured the video from the FOX 23 website, and who has analyzed the tape. We provide elements of his video analysis with this statement.Mr. Huff has stated to NUFORC that, based on his analysis of the footage, the object is genuine, and that it is not a superimposed image. He also stated that the object is on the other side of the clouds, which provides some perspective as to the size of the object, and its velocity, which Mr. Huff concludes is considerable.We extend our gratitude to Mr. Huff for sharing his analysis with NUFORC and Jeff Rense.Prepared by Peter B.

AUTHORITIES WILL CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THE VIDEO TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FLYING OBJECT IS. WE\'LL KEEP YOU POSTED', 'Kentucky Train Collision with Disk UFO, 2002Paintsville, Kentucky -- At exactly 2:47 a.m. on January 14, 2002, while working a coal train enroute from Russell, Kentucky to Shelbiana, Kentucky, our trailing unit and first two cars were severely damaged as we struck an unknown floating or hovering object. I know it was 2:47 because my watch froze, and to this day shows that time. Along with my watch the entire electrical systems on both locomotives went haywire. Approaching a bend near milepost 42 in an area referred to as the Wild Kingdom, for the many different types of animals spotted there, my conductor and I saw lights coming from around the way. This ordinarily means another train is coming and will pass on the other track. The outlay of the area is this, the river, #1 track, #2 tracks and a straight up mountainside, carved out for the laying of these tracks. I killed our lights as not to blind the oncoming crew. As we rounded the corner our onboard computer began to flash in and out, speed recorder went nuts, and both locomotives died. Alarm bells began to ring and that’s when we saw the objects. Apparently scanning the river for something. At least three objects had several ""search"" lights trained there, the first object hovered about 10 to 12 feet above the track.  It was metallic silver in color with multiple colored lights near the bottom and in the middle. There were no windows or openings of any kind that we could see. It was 18 to 20 feet in length and probably ten feet high. With both engines dead as we rounded the corner we made little noise and the first object did not respond in time, I estimate that we hit the object at 30 mph with 16,000 trailing tons behind us. It clipped the top of our lead unit then skipped back slicing a chunk out of our trailing unit and first two coal cars. The other objects vanished. Our emergency brakes had initiated due to the loss of power and we stopped approximately a mile and a half to two miles after impact. Our power restored after we were stopped and we notified our dispatcher, located in Jacksonville, Florida of what had happened. We were told to inspect the cars to see if they\'d hold the rail and try to limp into milepost cmg 60 which used to be the Paintsville yard which is no longer in full operation. We checked everything out and the cab of the rear locomotive was demolished and smoking, the second two cars looked as if they had been hit with a giant hammer, but looked like they\'d hold the rail.  We pulled into Paintsville yard at approximately 5:15 am. The huge overhead lights lining the yard were noticeably dark and the only lights came from what we assumed were railroad officials vehicles parked near the end of the track. We pulled to a stop and began unloading our grips off the wounded train. We could hear what sounded like an army of workers immediately tending to our train. Vehicle doors slamming, guys running by in weird outfits and lights glaring from all directions, the one thing missing was railroad officials. A guy named Ferguson shook my hand and asked me to follow him into the old yard office. We did, once inside they, and by they I mean I have no idea who these people were, began to ask us hundreds of questions, they then told us for our own protection we\'d be medically tested before we could leave. I asked repeatedly to talk to my road foreman or trainmaster and not only were these requests denied but they confiscated my conductor’s cellular phone. Hours later we were led outside the old yard office and the strange things continued to happen, the 2 locomotives and two cars were removed from the rest of the train we had brought in and my only guess was parked 4 tracks over under a huge tent like structure buzzing with activity. We were led off the property and told, due to national security, our silence on this matter would be appreciated. We were then put in a railroad vehicle and taken to Martin, Kentucky were we went through questioning again with railroad officials and were then drug tested. After all of this we were sent on to Shelbiana, where we took rest for 8 hours and worked another train back to Russell. Working back we passed by Paintsville, no sign of the engines, cars, tent, people, nothing.

The man had stayed out longer than he expected that day. He estimated that it was about 7:30 P.M. (local time) as he was walking back to his vehicle, when he noticed a bright light south of his location, moving towards him in a northerly direction. His first impression was that it was an airplane.The light appeared similar to the brightness of a normal aircraft light when first observed. He then noticed that the light suddenly stopped, then began to pulsate and appear to brighten and dim. The witness then noticed a faint haze that was orange-red in color, and which encircled the object.The pulsation pattern of the light began to increase, and it started to flicker very rapidly. The light became much brighter as it pulsated. Suddenly a thin beam of very bright blue-white light was emitted from the bottom of the object to the ground.The witness points out that this was not an ordinary searchlight.The witness stated, ""This was no searchlight. Even a well focused searchlight tends to diffuse with distance, but this light was a tight, bright beam from top to bottom."" The man tried to describe the appearance of the beam with the following statement. ""Imagine a piece of dental floss held at arms length, and you\'ll have a good idea of the beam\'s apparent width from my location.""The witness said that the pulsating effect suddenly stopped, and the beam of light went out. The observer commented, ""As far as the form, I couldn\'t see any craft or object per se, just the bright light itself and the beam that came down from it, as it was pretty dark at the time."" The object at first appeared to be circular in shape and orange-red in color. When the object stopped moving and began pulsating it seemed more oval or egg shaped.The object continued to hover in the sky, and the witness ran to his vehicle which was about 100 yards away, to get his Olympus digital camera. The witness took one photograph as the object hovered, then a second picture was obtained just as the object was beginning to move around slowly in a tight circle. As the man prepared to take a third picture, the object, ""suddenly shot straight up in the air at fantastic speed and was gone from sight.""The sky conditions at the time of observation were described as partly cloudy. The witness did not detect any sound, or odd smells during the sighting. The witness estimates the total incident lasted about 5 minutes or less.The witness commented that at the location where the light beam appeared to meet the ground, he estimated that he was about 1/4 mile away, or farther from the object, and that it was about 1,000 feet in altitude. The witness also mentioned that there is a large microwave relay tower at the top of the mountain, and, ""the beam appeared to be hitting the ground close to the tower."" The man couldn\'t see the exact spot where the beam hit.In closing, the witness had these comments to make. ""I don\'t know what this thing was, but I know I\'ve never seen anything like it before."" and ""If anyone else saw this object, please let me know. If for no other reason, so I can stop questioning my sanity."" source:Researcher: Stan Gordon']"
1960, ,"['The Official Explanation Corning, CaliforniaAugust 13, 196011:50 p.m.California Highway Patrol Officers Charles A. Garson and Stanley Scott were patrolling on Hoag Road, east of Corning, California when they saw what looked like a huge airliner descending from the sky in front of them. Thinking that a plane was about to crash, they stopped and got out of the car to get a better look. They watched as the object descended in complete silence to about 100 to 200 feet from the ground, then suddenly reversed and climbed back to about 500 feet from the ground and stopped. Officer Carson described it in a police teletype report: At this time it was clearly visible to both of us. It was surrounded by a glow making the round or oblong object visible. At each end, or each side of the object, there were definite red lights. At times about five white lights were visible between the red lights. As we watched the object moved again and performed aerial feats that were actually unbelievable. The officers radioed the Tehama County Sheriff\'s Office and asked Deputy Clarence Fry to contact the local Air Force radar station at Red Bluff. Deputy Fry reported back that the radar station verified that an unidentified object was visible on radar. As they continued to watch the object: On two occasions the object came directly towards the patrol vehicle; each time it approached, the object turned, swept the area with a huge red light. Officer Scott turned the red light on the patrol vehicle towards the object, and it immediately went away from us. We observed the object use the red beam approximately 6 or 7 times, sweeping the sky and ground areas. The object then began to move slowly to the east, and the officers followed. When they had reached the Vina Plains Fire Station, the object was approached by a second object that came from the south. The second object moved near to the first and both stopped and hovered for some time, occasionally emitting red beams. After a time, both objects vanished below the eastern horizon. They had observed the first object for a total of about two hours and fifteen minutes. When they returned to the Tehama County Sheriff\'s Office, they found that the object had also been seen by Deputies Fry and Montgomery, as well as by the night jailer. All described the same thing. The next day, Officers Carson and Scott drove to the Red Bluff Air Station to discuss the sighting and to speak to the operator that had seen it on radar. The Air Force, however, now denied that the object had been seen on radar, contradicting what the radar operator had told Deputy Fry the night before. The visit was completely unproductive. More information regarding the sighting was obtained by NICAP(National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) advisor Walter N. Webb, who contacted Carson and received a copy of the report, drawings of the object, and a letter from Carson. In the letter, dated November 14, 1960, Carson said: We made several attempts to follow it, or I should say get closer to it, but the object seemed aware of us and we were more successful remaining motionless and allow it to approach us, which it did on several occasions. In the original report, Carson also mentioned that: Each time the object neared us, we experienced radio interference. Again, from the letter to Webb: The object was shaped like a football, the edges, or I should say outside of the object were clear to us...[the] glow was emitted by the object, was not a reflection of other lights.The Official Explanation   What was the ""official"" explanation for the sighting? In a letter to a NICAP member, the Air Force said: The findings [are] that the individuals concerned witnessed a refraction of the planet Mars and the bright stars Aldebaran and Betelgeux. . . [temperature inversions] contributed to the phenomena as the planet Mars was quite low in the skies and the inversion caused it to be projected upward. They also said: A contributing factor to the sightings could have been the layer of smoke which hung over the area in a thin stratiform layer. This smoke came from the forest fires in the area hung in layer due to the stable conditions associated with the inversions. When NICAP pointed out that Mars, Aldebaran, and Betelgeuse were all below the horizon at the time of the sighting, the Air Force changed the star involved to Capella, which was slightly above the eastern horizon at the time. They neglected to explain the fact that, as the sighting progressed, Capella would have risen in the sky, whereas the objects disappeared below the eastern horizon at the end of the sighting. Officer Carson had this to say about the Air Force explanations: ... I have been told we saw Northern lights, a weather balloon, and now refractions.… I served 4 years with the Air Force, I believe I am familiar with the Northern lights, also weather balloons. Officer Scott served as a paratrooper during the Korean Conflict. Both of us are aware of the tricks light can play on the eyes during darkness. We were aware of this at the time. Our observations and estimations of speed, size, etc. came from aligning the object with fixed objects on the horizon. I agree we find it difficult to believe what we were watching, but no one will ever convince us that we were witnessing a refraction of light. A check of the meteorological records of the area for that night by atmospheric physicist James E. MacDonald failed to find any evidence that would indicate the presence of a temperature inversion. Over the next week, similar sightings were reported, including another sighting the very next evening by Deputies Fry and Montgomery that was also seen by a Corning police officer.

(Loy Lawhon) ', '1960\'s Grand Bend Kansas UFO Sighting by Dirk Vander PloegIn the early 1960\'s we lived in Kansas. We were small children then had a house on the North End of Great Bend, on the North end of Morton Street.One night in 1964 or 65, I looked out of the kitchen window and saw a \'white cube\' that glowed like a light bulb. It had a red light glowing on the inside of it. There are or were quite a few radio towers in the area and one huge TV 2 tower farther to the North. The \'cube shaped thing\' flew around that radio tower like a moth flies around a light bulb, only slower than a moth and it never hit the tower. Also, the red light was fading on an off like the tower light. Now, I believe the object was trying to communicate with the tower.When I first saw the object I was transfixed like a deer in headlights!I ran to get my dad but like most dads, he said not to bother him, so I ran back to the kitchen yelling for my two brothers to come. When I got back to the window it was still flying near the tower. Just before my brothers got to the window it traveled across the field towards me. It started hovering around 75 feet above the ground and was approximately 200 yards away. That\'s when my two brothers joined me at the window and started asking, ""What is that, what is that?""It spun so fast that it morphed into a spinning ball and appeared as a white streak as it shot almost straight up angling towards the North West and was gone. We were very excited at witnessing how it zoomed away. ""That was fast, really fast!"", reverberated in the room.At the North end of the street was a wheat field, then to the North edge of that about one mile is the Dry Walnut Creek and on the North edge of that was the radio tower. The radio tower was around one and a quarter mile from the kitchen window where I first saw it. The 15 houses on our street, including ours, lined up along the wheat field East and West.Years ago a man asked me about the sighting. He showed me a lot of pictures of UFO\'s and asked if the object looked like any of them? When I said \'No"", he suddenly wore a strange expression on his face. I have no idea who he was. All I know is that he was someone my dad knew. I would like to ask him where he got the pictures and if this sighting was some sort of simulation.The object was very clear, a perfect shaped cube - not at all blurry. As it flew around the tower it really tumbled and then sped across the field at 100 to 150 mph, rolled a little, but as it hovered it stayed on a perfectly flat plane and slowly turned. It glistened: not bright like a 100 watt light bulb but still glowing. The light was uniform throughout the object. The red light inside the craft disappeared after a few seconds, then it spun into a ball and left. As I mentioned the object was cube-shaped and reminds me now of the Star Trek Borg ships. I would like to know where the show\'s creator, Gene Roddenberry, got the idea for that cube ship, although, the only similarity between my sighting and the Borg cube was its shape.I believe we saw the object because we are not alone on this planet. Whatever we saw flying around that radio tower still intrigues me today!The way the craft moved makes me believe it was under intelligent control. It maneuvered deliberately from field to field, sped up and slowed down and changed height. It was the size of a small box truck: 20 feet wide by 20 feet long. Today, I believe that the craft was just curious as if it had just discovered us by perhaps following the TV signal with the sub carrier wave to its source.This is a true story and I wanted to share it.Sighting was reported by Wade Meyer and written with his assistance.Dirk Vander Ploeg is the editor and publisher of UFODigest.com and PsiTalk.com.

His 40-plus years has involved investigations of hundredsof UFO reports, but few were as interesting as this Close Encounter, E-Mcase in October of 1973, right at the peak of a world-wide sighting wave.Francis Ridge:It was October 20, 1973, and near Mt. Vernon & Evansville,Indiana. This incident occurred during the massive sighting waveof 1973, and within a few days of one of our rare MADAR detections. Mywife got a call early that morning. I was at work. She told me that theman was very serious about something that had happened that morning. Theman calling was a conductor on a L&N train and had just had an encounterwith a UFO at 6:50 AM, just a few miles east of our home. To be precise,it was at a point on the tracks near St. Phillips, which is about 8-mileseast of us towards Evansvilles. I got in the car and headed home, calledthe man and taped the interview. Later I conducted a full investigation.\xa0The original train crew had experienced engine trouble near Upton, alittle town 3-4 miles northwest of Mt. Veron. One of the rear diesal unitshad been overheating and the Burlington engine was pulling a 6,000-tonload, overloaded under these conditions. The maintenance man at Upton wasa 30-year man and told the conductor that the rear unit was ""dead""and thatthere was, in his words, ""no use messin\' with it."" He\'d already tried.In any case, the new crew lumbered in to Mt. Vernon, taking 20-25 minuteslonger to get there than usual. The sky was clear, temperature was a cool55-degrees, wind was calm. Again, it was about 6:50 AM.\xa0They had gone through Mt. Vernon and were nearing the Lamont crossing,2-miles east of the city, heading east for Evansville. The sun was justbarely peeking over the tree tops. The two men in the front engine sawa very bright, but distant, light in the sky coming out of the north. Atfirst they thought it was an aircraft, then later decided that it couldn\'tbe. The object was very bright and was tracking north to south, pulsatingfrom real bright to dim to bright. The distant light appeared to travela short distance, 50-60\' between pulsations. The light finally turned moreeast towards Evansville and disappeared.\xa0When they neared Caborn (6-7 miles east of Mt. Vernon), the lead conductortold the rear conductors by intercom that they had seen a real bright light.Whenthey got near St. Phillips, the rear conductor reported that there nowwas a train following them, on the same track. By then they had gottenup on Belknap hill (at Peerlsess Crossing), ""a pretty good pull on a train"",and had gotten hung up. One of the rear men suggested that they shouldget the train behind them, which he said had been following them for awhile,to push them. The lead conductor replied, ""Well, I haven\'t heard him onthe radio."" After a short while the rear man suggested the same solutionto the problem, again: ""Well, he\'s been following us and I can see hislight back there and the \'board\' is red!"" The object following them hadgiven them a ""red board"" on their blocking system. The signal referredto here is a series of lights, similar in color to regular traffic lights,situated on a pole on the side of the tracks. This shows either red, amber,or green, indicating ""danger"" , ""caution"", or ""all clear"", respectively.(This signal is a part of the Automatic Blocking System which tells ofother traffic on the same track). The ""red board"" normally meant that somethingwas on the track behind them. The rear conductor again suggested that thecrew call the ""tower"" (Howell Round House at Evansville) and see if therewas a train behind them.\xa0A quick check with the yardmaster showed that there was no train behindthem at all. Upon receiving the news, the rear conductor replied, ""Thereis a headlight behinds us. I can see it. It\'s real bright.""\xa0 Afterthe train had gotten hung up and had stopped on Belknap Hill, they gotout and looked around. The conductor, after backing the train down thehill, got out, walked down to the rear unit and pressed the restart button.To his surprise the unit ""kicked right off, ran real good"". The light orthe object was now moving off, back from where it had come from. Accordingto the conductor, whatever had given them a ""red board"", now was givingthem a ""green board"". As he, himself, stated, ""The board went green. Thelight cleared up the board"". The train, previously hampered with a badrear unit and way over-tonnage, was now fully able to climb the steep,hill and made it in to Howell without further mishap!\xa0What makes this case interesting is in this detailed report (this isonly a synopsis) something very bright was first seen, then a similar brightlight follows a train, a diesal. Tractors and other diesals have been virtuallyunaffected by UFOs. The Blocking System reacts as the object approachesand recedes, just as if there was a train on that track. The train, originallydisabled (and reportedly with a ""dead"" rear unit) now works fine even withover-tonnage when the UFO is out of the picture. All this during a massivesighting wave with some of the best close encounters we ever recorded!And that\'s not all. The crew was reprimanded for filing a report. Laterwe found that the engine had been pulled and taken down south to be studiedand reportedly the U.S.Air Force was involved.\xa0Source:http://www.nicap.dabsol.co.uk/book.htmWritten by Francis Ridge, then Director of the UFO Filter Center& MADAR Project.']"

Air Force Leaders began looking for possible sites for air bases in the northern United States. The city of Minot sold the Air Force on becoming a site for a new base in 1954. The following year Minot businessmen and citizens donated approximately $50,000 to buy the first portions of land for the base. The ground breaking took place July 12, 1955, and construction started shortly after.The base started out as a Air Defense Command (ADC) Base and the first unit was the 32d Fighter Group, activated on Feb. 7, 1957. The Air Force took up occupancy eight days later on Feb. 15. There was a small ceremony in front of base Ops when the Army Corp. of Engineers officer turned over the key to the base to the first base commander Major Joe E. Roberts. Personnel celebrated the first church service in July 1958, and the Base Exchange opened in Sept. 1958. That same year, Air Defense Command established a Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) sector at Minot AFB, it was construction of a huge, windowless blast-resistant concrete building. IBM engineers installed two large, 275-ton computers in the basement of the building.Activated in June 1961, the SAGE facility processed air surveillance information and sent the data to Air Defense Command units.The first permanent Strategic Air Command (SAC) unit assigned to Minot AFB was the 4136th Strategic Wing in September 1958 and within six months, the 906th Air Refueling Squadron was activated and assigned to the 4136th. They provided air refueling support to northern defense operations. The first KC-135A Stratotanker, dubbed ""Miss Minot,"" arrived September 23, 1959. In addition, there was one U-2 aircraft stationed on base for 18 months as part of ""Operation CROWFLIGHT.""In late January 1960, the 32d Fighter Group brought the first F-106 Delta Dart to Minot. The F106\'s were assigned to the 5th Fighter Interceptor Squadron (FIS) which was transferred to Minot from Suffolk County Airport, New York on February 1, 1960. An interesting thing about the Fifth, was their mascots, two live lynx kittens that produced several offspring which were kept on base. The scope of operations grew as the Air Force assigned the 525th Bombardment Squadron to the 4136th. In July 1961, the first B-52H Stratofortress, named ""Peace Persuader,"" arrived on base and within five months the base received its first Hound Dog Missile to give the B-52 its first stand-off capabilityAlso in 1961, the Air Force selected the land around Minot for a new Minuteman I Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) complex. Field construction began on the missile complex in January 1962. SAC activated the 455th Strategic Missile Wing (SMW) in November 1962, and in less than a year, on September 9, 1963, the first Minuteman I Missile arrived from Hill AFB, Utah. It was placed in Launch Facility A-02, September 9, 1963. Within a short 28 months, in April 1964, the 455th became combat ready. The amber waves of grain over the North Dakota plains were implanted with a combat ready ICBM system born of the latest American technology.As SAC’s mission continued to grow at Minot, ownership passed from ADC to SAC. As Minot\'s mission changed, the SAGE center was deactivated in May 1963 and eventually housed numerous base agencies and today is known as the Professional Results In Daily Endeavors (PRIDE) Building.Minot AFB\'s organizational makeup changed in mid-1968, when the 91st Strategic Missile Wing replaced the 455th Strategic Missile Wing, and the 5th Bombardment Wing (BMW) replaced the 450th Bombardment Wing. These changes were in line with Air Force policy in keeping active those units with the most illustrious histories. Force modernization characterized Minot AFB during the 1970s. The Air Force selected the 91 SMW to become the first wing to convert to the Minuteman III ICBM. The Minuteman III tripled the striking power and enhanced the credibility of the SAC deterrent force. The 741st Strategic Missile Squadron became the first operational Minuteman III squadron in December 1970, and the entire wing converted by December 1971. The 5 BMW added the Short Range Attack Missile (SRAM) to its arsenal in September 1973, and later equipped its bombers with an improved offensive avionics system for more accurate bombing.Following the 1980 Iran hostage crisis, SAC tasked the 57th Air Division (AD), which had been on base since the mid 70\'s, to organize the Strategic Projection Force (SRF). The 57 AD became the first division in SAC to implement this concept. The 5 BMW\'s B-52H fleet became the spearhead of this force, able to provide conventional warfare anywhere in the world. In the late 1980\'s the 57 AD became the host unit, providing logistical, security, administrative and other support services to the 5 BMW, 91 SMW and tenant organizations.In the mid 80\'s the 5th Fighter Interceptor Squadron converted from the F-106 to the F-15 Eagles. The F-15s only flew over Minot until the spring of 1988, when the 5 FIS was deactivated. After the unit inactivated, their mascots, two of the lynx kittens were donated to the Roosevelt Park Zoo in Minot, where they\'re still living today. In 1988, the Air Force selected Minot AFB for the Commander-in-Chief\'s Installation Excellence Award. This presidential award recognizes those military installations that combine mission excellence with a concern for people to produce working and living conditions truly above other installations. Closing out the 1980s Minot continued to answer America\'s strategic needs. Rivet MILE, the Minuteman Integrated Life Extension program, is a nine-year modification program for missile support systems and facilities. It will maintain the Minuteman III as an effective deterrent into the next century. The 5 BMW continued to modernize in October 1989, when they added the Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) to their arsenal.Entering the 1990s, Minot AFB demonstrated its war-fighting capabilities by deploying aircraft and personnel to the Middle East for the overwhelming victory over Iraq during Operation DESERT STORM. After the war, the base prepared for changes as the Air Force directed a major reorganization. In June 1991, the 57th Air Division was inactivated and the 5th Bomb Wing (BW) assumed host base responsibilities. As the ""Cold War"" came to an end, 5th Bomb Wing\'s aircraft came off alert status in September 1991, after 35 years of continuous alert.  In June 1992, the newly formed Air Combat Command (ACC) replaced Strategic Air Command (SAC) as host command. Both the 91st and 5th fell under the newly formed ACC. The following summer the 91st was reassigned to Air Force Space Command.The 5 BW gained the Advanced Cruise Missiles (ACM) for the B-52 in the spring of 1993. In January 1994, the base lost one of its oldest units, the 906th Air Refueling Squadron. The final KC-135 departed Minot three months later. The 91st Missile Wing (MW) completed its first major upgrade on the command, control, and communication systems of the Minuteman III ICBM’s launch and control centers in August 1996. They did it with the new Rapid Execution and Combat Targeting (REACT) upgrade program. The 91 MW continues to modernize their Missile Alert Facilities (MAF) through ""Alert Imaging."" A continuing event for the base is the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). Since the treaty went into force in late 1994, the base received eight inspections, four on the 91 MW and four on the 5 BW, the latest in October 1997. On October 1, 1997, the 91st Missile Wing was redesignated the 91st Space Wing (SW).Minot AFB has undergone many changes throughout the years, but one thing remains constant -- Team Minot spirit continues to reign, re-emphasizing the truth that ""Only the Best Come North.""', ' 1950, Dr. Botta Enters Flying SaucerMany reports of UFO encounters made by single individuals are often given little weight by most investigators. However, when that one person is of high esteem and credibility, the case is given much weight. Such is the case with an Alien encounter that occurred in 1950 in South America. The lone witness was Dr. Enrique Caretenuto Botta, who passed his incredible story on to Horacio Gonzales G. in Caracas at a UFO conference in 1955. Dr. Botta would soon give permission to Horacio G. to relate the story to famed UFO researcher Leon Stringfield. The researcher would release the details of the Botta encounter in his book, ""Situation Red.""At the time of the encounter, Dr. Botta was a man of 40 years old. He was well educated and respected by all who knew him. He was an ex-war pilot and aeronautical engineer. He was employed as an architectural engineer working with a well known company in Caracas in 1950. His job had placed him in Argentina working on a large construction project when he would be involved in the most bizarre event of his life. Botta was driving down the highway about seventy-five miles from his hotel in an isolated area known as Bahia Blanca when he saw a metallic, disc-shaped object sitting on the grass just off the road way. He stopped his car to watch the object for a few minutes to see what would happen. After seeing no sign of movement, he decided to get even closer to the unknown object. This vantage point allowed him to see an opening or doorway in the object\'s side. He decided to go inside. At first the craft\'s inside seemed empty, except for a blinking red light in a domed top. As he ventured farther inside, he saw a curved divan with four seats; three of these seats were occupied with small beings about four feet tall with gray, tight-fitting overalls. The three small creatures were facing a control panel. It consisted of lights, gauges, and meters of different types.Standing quietly behind them, Botta could not resist the urge to touch one of the small beings. As he did, he felt a rigid, charred texture. The three strange creatures were dead! All within a moment, he rushed from the saucer,  got into his car, and was speeding down the highway. Arriving at his hotel, he related his strange experience to two of his closest friends. The group of men armed themselves with weapons and decided to return to the scene of Botta\'s encounter. However, it being almost dark, and the area being so isolated, they changed their minds, and opted for the next morning to do their search.Early the next day, Botta led the three directly to the spot of the previous day\'s unusual encounter, but there was no craft there now. All that was found at the site the object had occupied was a pile of ashes. One of the men scooped some up. Immediately, his hand turned purple, and remained that way for several days. The three men, discouraged by the absence of the object, began to look around the area to see if any other evidence of its landing could be found. One of the men looked up and saw three objects in the sky. One, the largest of the three, was cigar-shaped, while the two smaller objects were disc-shaped. Dr. Botta hurriedly took five pictures of the objects, of which only two showed vague images of the objects. Soon, the two smaller objects joined the cigar-shaped flying object. The three became one, turned blood red, and quickly disappeared from view.Dr. Botta would later relate more details of his observations on the day of the incident. He would recall that he saw vents or holes in the floor of the object. The control panel had a transparent sphere above it which rotated. The rigidness of the aliens\' skin was an indication to him that they had died in a crash or malfunction. He also was amazed at the skin of the saucer, which was metallic in appearance, but had a ""rubbery"" feel to it.Immediately after the encounter, Dr. Botta came down with a fever, and his skin was blistered.  Doctors were unable to discover the origin of either ailment. The symptoms lasted for several weeks. He also had an impression of the sunglasses he wore into the craft on his face. A test showed no sign of radiation. Botta kept the details of his strange encounter private, except for his two companions, Horacio Gonzales G., and Leon Stringfield. Although the details of the strange happenings in Argentina seem most improbable, the character and reputation of Botta make this case extremely difficult to discount.(B J Booth) source:Leon Stringfield, Situation Red, p. 80', 'GORDON COOPER & UFOs: AN ASTRONAUT SPEAKS OUT by Timothy Green Beckley ""One of the few individuals whose prominence is beyond question has, however, over the past few months, dared to open his mouth and challenge the status quo. Gordon Cooper was one of America\'s original astronauts. He helped pioneer this country\'s space exploration efforts when, aboard a tiny space capsule known as Mercury [Faith] 7, Cooper orbited the Earth for 34 hours, proving that man could live outside our atmosphere for prolonged periods. His patriotism, bravery and respectability go without saying... Cooper has recently made several public pronouncements concerning his strong belief in UFOs. While a guest on the Merv Griffin Show, Cooper shocked the viewing audiences by speaking for over five minutes on a topic that was only within the past few years often considered too bizarre for polite conversation. But there were some things that Cooper wouldn\'t even discuss on the air in front of the curious multitudes. Luckily Lee Spiegel is a personal friend of Gordon Cooper. They have conferred on several occasions, and while in the company of the man who is bound and determined to crack the \'Cosmic Watergate\' which he is convinced exists within the higher echelon of government, the former space traveler is more than happy to talk about his UFO experiences - and they are many. In the early 1950s, Cooper was assigned to a jet fighter group in Germany. While stationed there, he remembers very vividly the week an entire formation of circular objects passed over the Air Base on almost a daily routine. \'We never could get close enough to pin them down, but they were round in shape and very metallic looking,\' Cooper points out. UFOs were to continue to haunt him when the Air Force Colonel was transferred several years later to Edwards Air Force Base Flight Test Center in the California desert. What happened one afternoon while he was on duty at this military base is evidence enough that the government definitely does keep a lot of secrets when it comes to UFOs! The incident took place in the late 1950s, either 1957 or 1958 - as Cooper can best recall; and to this day, the photographic evidence of an actual UFO touching down upon the Earth is being kept under wraps. During this period, Cooper was a Project Manager at Edwards Air Force Base, just three or four years before entering America\'s space program. After lunch this particular day, Cooper had assigned a team of photographers to an area of the vast dry lake beds near Edwards. In a taped interview with UFOlogist Lee Spiegel, the former Astronaut disclosed that while the crew was out there, they spotted a strange-looking craft above the lake bed, and they began taking films of it. Cooper says the object was very definitely \'hovering above the ground. And then it slowly came down and sat on the lake bed for a few minutes.\' All during this time the motion picture cameras were filming away. \'There were varied estimates by the cameramen on what the actual size of the object was,\' Cooper confesses, \'but they all agreed that it was at least the size of a vehicle that would carry normal-sized people in it.\' Col. Cooper was not fortunate enough to be outside at the time of this incredible encounter, but he did see the films as soon as they were rushed through the development process. \'It was a typical circular-shaped UFO,\' he recollects. \'Not too many people saw it, because it took off at quite a sharp angle and just climbed straight on out of sight!\' Cooper admits he didn\'t take any kind of poll to determine who had seen the craft, \'because there were always strange things flying around in the air over Edwards.\' This is a statement Lee Spiegel was able to verify through his own research efforts, having obtained closely guarded tapes of conversations between military pilots circling the base and their commanding officers in the flight tower, tracking the presence of unknown objects. \'People just didn\'t ask a lot of questions about things they saw and couldn\'t understand,\' notes Cooper, who adds that it was a lot simpler to look the other way, shrug one\'s shoulders, and chalk up what had been seen to \'just another experimental aircraft that must have been developed at another area of the air base.\' But what about the photographic proof - the motion picture footage - that was taken? \'I think it was definitely a UFO,\' Cooper states, as he makes no bones about it. \'However, where it (the object) came from and who was in it is hard to determine, because it didn\'t stay around long enough to discuss the matter - there wasn\'t even time to send out a welcoming committee!\' After he reviewed the film at least a dozen times, the footage was quickly forwarded to Washington. Cooper no doubt expected to get a reply in a few weeks\' time as to what his men had seen and photographed, but there was no word, and the movie *vanished* - never to surface again.... On coast-to-coast television, Cooper recently made a blockbuster statement that had the telephone lines tied up the next day, as viewers telephoned the stations which carried the syndicated Merv Griffin Show, anxious to find out if their ears had been playing tricks on them the night before. Toward the end of the talk-show host\'s interview with the former Astronaut, Merv broke into a secretive tone of voice right on the air, and aimed a hundred-thousand-dollar question at his guest: \'There is a story going around, Gordon, that a spaceship did land in middle America and there were occupants, and members of our government were able to keep one of the occupants alive for a period of time. They\'ve seen the metal of the aircraft and they know what the people look like - is that a credible story?\' For all intents and purposes Cooper should have laughed for assuredly such a speculative story belongs in the category of science fiction or space fantasy. But Gordon Cooper kept a straight face when he replied: \'I think it\'s fairly credible. I would like to see the time when all qualified people could really work together to properly investigate these stories and either refute or prove them.\' The bombshell had been dropped. Cooper went on to say that from the various reports of UFO contacts and abductions he had been privy to, he was convinced that the occupants of this crashed UFO were \'probably not that different from what we are,\' - that they are almost totally humanoid (i.e., have two arms, two legs, a torso and readily identifiable facial features) in appearance. Taken aback by what Cooper had said over the national airwaves, Lee Spiegel telephoned Cooper\'s office the following morning and managed to get past his private secretary, though others in the media were getting the cold shoulder. \'Cooper admitted to me that he could have revealed more on the air, but he decided not to play his entire hand because he felt certain that some \'official eyebrows were going to get raised\'.\'"" source: ""MJ-12 and the Riddle of Hangar 18"" by Timothy Green Beckley; 1981; Inner Light Publications P.O.

', '1950, The Great Falls, Montana UFO Film A classic UFO film was taken on August 15, 1950, by Nicolas Mariana, general manager of the Great Falls ""Selectrics"" baseball team. This film was listed as Top Secret and, although now declassified, is still considered an ""unknown.""Note that in government ""releases"" (National Archives, etc.), the distant objects in the frames almost don\'t show up. However, even the TNT versions (as you will see later) show that the objects were clearly visible and oval-shaped, especially in the early footage. And the evidence strongly suggests that what Mariana has told us for a long time is true, much of the early footage was apparently removed by the Air Force. NICAP Synopsis: Nick Mariana, Great Falls, Montana, obtained 16 mm color movies of two UFOs which appear as bright circular points of light. Footage of UFOs at closer range, confirming visual observation of discs with rotating rims, was reported missing from film when returned by Air Force. Remaining footage was contained in United Artists documentary movie ""UFO"" and compared to July 2, 1952, Trementon, Utah film showing similar images. Mr. Mariana used Daylight Kodachrome film in a Revere turret type camera and obtained 315 frames showing the UFOs. The film was examined by the Air Force and Navy, but no formal reports released. Report on Photogrammetric analysis by Dr. Robert M.L. Baker, Jr., Douglas Aircraft Corporation, on file at NICAP. Air Force explanation that UFOs were reflections off jet aircraft said to be ""quite strained,"" and the analyst states no definite conclusion.

Sometimes, only those who pay for first generation access get to see what was originally caught on video, as opposed to second and third generation ""copies."")', '1950-The Trent PhotographsA classic set of impressive UFO photos was taken by Mr. and Mrs. Trentin the early part of the evening, just before sunset, on May 11, 1950,near McMinnville, Oregon. According to the Trent\'s account the object,as it appeared over their farm was first seen by Ms. Trent while she wasfeeding the farm\'s rabbits. She then quickly called her husband who gotthe family\'s camera and Mr. Trent then took two shots from positions onlyjust a few feet apart. The pictures first appeared in a local newspaperand afterwards in Life magazine. Seventeen years later the photos weresubjected to a detailed analysis for the University of Colorado UFO Project.WilliamK. Hartmann, an astronomer from the University of Arizona, performed ameticulous photometric and photogrammetric investigation of the originalnegatives, and set up a scaling system to determine the approximate distanceof the UFO. Hartmann used objects in the near foreground, such as a house,tree, metal water tank, and telephone pole, whose images could be comparedwith that of the UFO. There were also hills, trees, and buildings in thefar distance whose contrast and details had been obscured by atmospherichaze.\xa0Hartmann used these known distances of various objects in the phototo calculate an approximate atmospheric attenuation factor. He then measuredthe relative brightnesses of various objects in the photos, and demonstratedthat their distances could generally be calculated with an accuracy ofabout +/- 30%. In the most extreme case, he would be in error by a factorof four. He then wrote:\xa0""It is concluded that by careful consideration of the parameters involvedin the case of recognizable objects in the photographs, distances can bemeasured within a factor-four error ... If such good measure could be madefor the UFO, we could distinguish between a distant extraordinary objectand a hypothetical small, close model.""\xa0Hartmann then noted that his photometric measurements indicated thatthe UFO was intrinsically brighter than the metallic tank and the whitepainted surface of the house, consistent with the Trent\'s description thatit was a shiny object. Further, the shadowed surface of the UFO was muchbrighter than the shadowed region of the water tank, which was best explainedby a distant object being\xa0 illuminated by scattered light from theenvironment.\xa0""it appears significant that the simplest most direct interpretationof the photographs confirms precisely what the witnesses said they saw""Hartmann further wrote that ""to the extent that the photometric analysisis reliable, (and the measurements appear to be consistent), the photographsindicate an object with a bright shiny surface at considerable distanceand on the order of tens of meters in diameter. While it would be exaggeratingto say that we have positively ruled out a fabrication, it appears significantthat the simplest most direct interpretation of the photographs confirmsprecisely what the witnesses said they saw.""\xa0In his conclusion, Hartmann reiterated this, stressing that all thefactors he had investigated, both photographic and testimonial, were consistentwith the claim that ""an extraordinary flying object, silvery, metallic,disc-shaped, tens of metres in diameter, and evidently artificial, flewwithin sight of [the] two witnesses.""\xa0Controversy - The Skeptics\' Case\xa0Not satisfied with Hartmann\'s findings and totally devoid of any evidencethat the UFO was a hoax and hanging from the wires, UFO debunker RobertSheaffer argued qualitatively that the haze in the photos (the haze veiledthe UFO and led Hartmann to conclude the UFO was about 1.3 kilometres distant)could be due to a ""dirty"" camera lens, and thus the object could stillbe close to the camera. He further argued that shadows on the garage werestrong evidence for a large time lag between the photos, and alleged thatthe shadow positions suggested the photos were taken at 7:30 in the morningrather than in the evening (the image on the left depicts the edge enhancementtechnique which, under typical conditions, can reveal the presence of awire less than a quarter of a millimetre thick at a distance of up to 3metres).\xa0Dr. Bruce Maccabee, an optical physicist, analyzed the original negativesand found no support for Sheaffer\'s time lag claim. He also repeated Hartmann\'scalculations in much greater detail, including corrections for lens greaseand obtained about the same results as Hartmann originally did. (One otherimportant aspect of Sheaffer\'s dirty lens hypothesis is that it fails toexplain why it didn\'t affect all objects in the photos, and not just theUFO. All the nearby objects in the photo were all sharp with high contrast,but the objects in the distance such as a barn, a house, trees, and hills(and the UFO), were of low contrast, exactly as would be expected fromabsorption and scattering of light.) Maccabee calculated the UFO to beover 1 kilometre away, and about 30 meters in diameter and 4 meters thick.\xa0Regarding the alleged reported time the photos were taken which, accordingto Sheaffer, would be inconsistent with the position of the shadows onthe photos, Maccabee discovered that the garage shadows could only havebeen caused by a diffuse light source, rebutting Sheaffer\'s argument. Maccabeesuggested that a bright cloud illuminated by the evening sun could possiblyhave caused them. Moreover, neither Sheaffer nor Klass has provided a plausiblecause as to why the Trents would have lied about this, especially sinceit is immaterial to analysis of the UFO\'s distance.\xa0Repeaters\xa0In his book ""UFOs Explained,"" Klass argued that the Trents were ""repeaters,""citing a story published in the Portland Oregonian June 10 in which Mrs.trent is quoted as saying to reporter Lou Gillette that ""she had seen similarobjects on the coast three different times but no one would believe me.""Klass further quotes from a newspaper article written about 17 years later,in which she is quoted as saying ""We\'ve seen quite a few since then butwe didn\'t get any pictures, they disappeared too fast.""\xa0Klass indictment of ""repeater"" is based solely on Mrs. Trent\'s claimsas reported in the paper. Assuming the account is accurate, an importantdetail however, is that Mr. Trent apparently did notagree with his wife.For reasons we can only guess, Klass did not include in his book Mr. Trent\'sresponse to the following question (story in the June 11, 1950 L.A. Examiner):\xa0""why [did you wait] so long before telling anyone about [the photos].Trent admitted he was \'kinda scared of it.\' He said: \'You know, you hearso much about those things... I didn\'t believe all that talk about flyingsaucers before, but now have an idea the Army knows what they are.""\xa0This suggests that Mr. Trent had not seen any UFOs before and was skepticalabout flying saucers (hence his wife\'s claim that ""no one would believeme"")... until he saw one himself. One get\'s into a logical muddle here.If, as Klass believes, there are no saucers and therefore the Trents couldn\'thave seen one, then Mrs. Trent must have been lying when she said she sawseveral previously. On the other hand, Mr. Trent was telling the truthabout his skepticism, although he could well have supported his wife\'sclaim by saying that he too had seen several even if he really didn\'t believethey existed. After all, if its a hoax, he could say anything to supportthe hoax story. One way to get out of this muddle is to assume that theyboth told the truth regarding previous sightings (Mrs. Trent had several,Mr. Trent had none and didn\'t believe in saucers). Of course, Mrs. Trentprevious sightings certainly could have been honest misidentifications...and if this were so then she wasn\'t really ""a repeater"" unless you classifya person who repeatedly and honestly misidentifies objects as ""a repeater""[Maccabee op. cit., private communication].\xa0By Brian ZeilerAlso: www.nicap.org']"

As they were driving along, they suddenly saw a strange light ahead of them. It was pale yellow and seemed to be zigzagging around. The object then shot straight towards the Knowles family and hovered right in front of the car.They described the object as looking like an egg in an egg cup. After swerving and zigzagging themselves to try and get clear of the object, they suddenly realized that the object was now hovering directly above their car. The Knowles family could hear a high-pitched humming sound as the car was being tossed from side to side by apparently very strong winds. During this time they also noticed a terrible smell of electrical burning, and the car was filling up with a strange grey mist. All of a sudden they realized that the car was no longer touching the surface of the road. It seemed to be hovering a few meters up. After a short while the car crashed back down to earth and crashed off the edge of the highway. Inside the car there was a fine sprinkling of powder, and the strange electrical burning smell. They reported the incident to both police and UFO investigators, who took samples of the grey powder. The powder contained chemicals very similar to those that NASA uses to coat the surface of the space shuttle. One theory put forward was that they had been engulfed in a fierce and very unusual form of electrically charged tornado. source:http.//www.ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages%2FAndyPage%2Ffamousuf.htm', '1988, DNA Sample From Khoury Abduction Raises Big Questions  Mystery Blonde Leaves Hair Behind -- But Who Was She? An abduction case from Australia has resulted in what may be the world\'s first DNA test of abduction-related biological material. The intriguing results raise many questions about the physical nature of abduction and also illustrate the need for more intensive scientific research on this worldwide mystery. The full case report by leading Australian researcher Bill Chalker was published in the Spring 1999 edition of International UFO Reporter, the quarterly journal of the Chicago-based J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). The following summary is published with Chalker\'s permission and assistance. Peter Khoury, the subject of this case, was born in Lebanon in 1964 and moved to Australia in 1973. There he met his future wife Vivian at school in 1981. Peter and Vivian were married in 1990 and now have two children. They live in Sydney. Peter works in the building trades and has owned his own business in cement rendering. Peter and Vivian had their first UFO experience in February 1988, a simple sighting of unusual moving lights. But in July of that year, Peter had a deeply disturbing, consciously remembered contact experience that, he says, changed his life. While lying on his bed, he felt something grab his ankles. He suddenly felt numb and paralyzed, but remained conscious. Then he noticed three or four small hooded figures alongside the bed. He experienced telepathic communication with one or more of these beings; he was told to relax and not be afraid because ""it would be like last time."" He then saw that they were about to insert a long needle into the side of his head, whereupon he blacked out. He jolted awake some time later, leaped out of bed and ran into the living room where he found his father and brother apparently dozing. Both he and his brother felt that only 10 minutes had passed since they had last been awake, but they soon realized that an hour or more had passed. The next morning, Peter and Vivian noticed that there was an obvious puncture mark on the side of his head, with a trace of dried blood. At this time, Peter had never heard of alien abduction. His memories were vivid and alarming, but he could find neither answers nor comfort from friends and acquaintances. Then, some months later, he and Vivian drove by a roadside billboard with an image of Whitley Strieber\'s book ""Communion,"" and they immediately got the book. Peter found numerous details in Strieber\'s account that matched his own strange experience. Peter\'s subsequent attempts to connect with local UFO groups and experiencers proved frustrating. Eventually, in April 1993, he resolved to found a new group in Sydney, the UFO Experience Support Association (UFOESA), dedicated to helping people understand and cope with their unusual encounters. He remains the coordinator of that group today. In July 1992, Peter had the experience that became the focus of this case study. Because the experience had disturbing sexual aspects, Peter was very reticent to talk about it. He first mentioned it to Bill Chalker, one of Australia\'s leading researchers, in 1996. He showed Chalker that he had recovered an unusual strand of hair from the encounter. At the time, Chalker felt he could not do anything with the physical evidence, but over the next several years, he assembled a group of scientists and forensic investigators willing to work on UFO-related cases. With his ""invisible college"" associates, Chalker discussed the possibility of doing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of mitochondrial DNA that might be recovered from Peter Khoury\'s hair sample. In early 1998, these researchers -- now calling themselves the Anomaly Physical Evidence Group -- agreed to do the DNA testing on the hair sample. Chalker points out that ""alien"" beings are most often described by experiencers as having no visible hair. But one type -- sometimes called ""Nordic"" -- is described fairly often as having distinctly human-like features including hair, often (though not always) blond in color. A number of well-known abduction cases have involved human-looking beings with hair, including the 1975 abduction reported by Travis Walton in Arizona, and the 1957 Brazilian abduction reported by Antonio Villas Boas. Peter Khoury\'s case has some similarity to that of Villas Boas, who said he was forced to have sex with an aggressive humanoid female aboard a landed UFO. Khoury told Chalker that his encounter of July 23, 1992 began at 7:30 in the morning while he was in bed. He had recently been injured at work and was taking pain medication. Earlier that morning, he had driven his wife to work, then returned home and went back to bed for a short while. Suddenly, he bolted wide awake and sat up. There were two humanoid females sitting on the bed, both entirely naked. These two women looked human in nearly every way. They had well proportioned adult bodies. One looked somewhat Asian, with straight dark shoulder-length hair and dark eyes. The other looked perhaps Scandinavian, with light-colored (""maybe bluish"") eyes and long blond hair that fell half-way down her back. Her hair was especially notable to Peter Khoury. ""I had never seen a hair style like that. It was curled something like Farrah Fawcett, but to an extreme... It just looked really exotic in a way,"" he told Chalker. But Khoury felt that these women were not exactly human. Their faces were somewhat odd -- not unattractive, but too chiseled, with very high cheekbones and eyes that were two or three times larger than normal. Khoury took special notice of the blonde. Her face was too long, he felt. ""I have never seen a human looking like that,"" he said. The blonde, who was sitting in a kneeling position on the bed, seemed to be in charge. Khoury thought she was communicating telepathically with the dark-haired woman, who was sitting with her legs partly folded under her. There was something stiff, almost blank, in the expressions of the women, Khoury thought. Though stunned by the sudden appearance of the women, Khoury had only a few moments to consider how they could possibly have arrived in his bedroom before the blonde reached out with both her hands and cupped the back of his head, drawing his face toward her chest. He resisted. She pulled harder. He kept pulling back. ""She was pretty strong,"" he told Chalker. ""She pulled me over and my mouth was basically on her nipple. And I bit."" Khoury said he doesn\'t know why he bit the woman, but even though he felt a small piece of her nipple come away in his teeth, she did not cry out. But ""the expression on her face was like, \'this isn\'t the way.\' In a way it was shock or confusion... She looked at the Asian one... and looked at me like, this isn\'t the way it\'s supposed to happen. You\'ve done this wrong."" Involuntarily, Khoury swallowed the small fragment in his mouth, and it caught in his throat. He went into a coughing fit. Suddenly, the two women simply disappeared. Once he realized the women were gone, he tried to clear his throat by drinking water. It didn\'t work. Then he had an urge to go to the bathroom. He realized that his penis felt very painful. Standing in the bathroom, he pulled back the foreskin and found two thin blond strands of hair wrapped tightly around. He struggled to unravel the pieces of hair as the pain became an intense burning sensation. Finally he managed to removed the two pieces of hair and immediately put them in a small sealable plastic bag. ""The reason I did that was because I knew that there was no way, no way at all, that a hair that size and wrapped around the way it was should have been there.... Thinking of these women, the thing in my throat, the hair, something bizarre had just happened."" Khoury resolved to keep the hair sample in case it should ever prove useful in shedding light on his experiences. The thing in Khoury\'s throat stayed there for three days. He coughed constantly. He tried clearing his throat with water, bread, anything he could think of, but nothing helped. On the third day, the feeling in his throat just went away. He did not want to tell his wife how his coughing fit had come about, but two weeks later he decided to tell her. ""I was shocked,"" he told Chalker. ""She accepted it better than I did."" The pieces of hair, carefully stored away since the encounter, became the subject of the first openly-reported scientific DNA test on a possible abduction-related sample. The blond hairs were extremely thin and almost clear in color. It was determined that the hair was not chemically treated, because if it had been, little or no mitochondrial DNA could have been recovered. However, using the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) process, good quality DNA was recovered. For comparison, samples were also taken of Peter Khoury\'s hair and that of his wife Vivian. DNA was successfully extracted from Peter\'s hair, but no usable DNA was recovered from Vivian\'s hair, possibly because of chemical treatment. After thorough testing of the hair samples, the scientists of the Anomaly Physical Evidence Group arrived at a startling conclusion. The thin blond hair, which appeared to have come from a light-skinned caucasian-type woman, could not have come from a normal human of that racial type. Instead, though human, the hair showed five distinctive DNA markers that are characteristic of a rare sub-group of the Chinese Mongoloid racial type. A detailed survey of the literature on variations in mitochondrial DNA, comprising tens of thousands of samples, showed only four other people on record with all five of the distinctive markers in the blond hair. All four were Chinese, with black hair. Mitochondrial DNA is passed only from mother to child and therefore offers a means of tracing ancient ancestry on the mother\'s side. The findings suggest that all four of the Chinese subjects share a common female ancestor with the blonde woman. But there is no easy explanation for how this could be. Testing for nuclear DNA, if such could be recovered from the blond hair, would be more complex and expensive than the tests run so far, but might show that the lineage of the blonde\'s father was even stranger than that of her mother. But such testing must await funding that has yet to be found. So far, the members of the Anomaly Physical Evidence Group have financed all their work themselves. Without the blond hair sample, the story told by Peter Khoury is but one more in an almost endless sequence of wrenching, but unprovable, abduction accounts. The hair, however, changes everything. It undeniably exists, and thorough forensic testing shows that it is anomalous. It seems likely that no person with blond hair and an exact DNA match to Khoury\'s blonde could be found in the city of Sydney, nor on the continent of Australia, nor -- probably -- anywhere in the world. Who then was the being whose blond hair inexplicably became wrapped around Peter Khoury\'s penis? ""Are we dealing with \'humans\' from elsewhere, namely those with human DNA, albeit very rare and somewhat anomolous?"" asks Bill Chalker. ""This case raises all sorts of issues, such as human \'panspermia\'"" -- the theory that human-like beings may have migrated to Earth in the fairly recent past from elsewhere in the galaxy, perhaps giving rise to the sudden appearance of modern homo sapiens sapiens, a species not directly descended from their immediate predecessors, the Neanderthals. ""Also, given the Asian mongoloid connection, we looked at the problem of European-like rare Asian types in the past,"" Chalker says. ""The controversial saga of the Taklamakan mummies in remote Western China is turning the early history of China on its head. These mummies include people who are quite tall, some 6 feet or so, and some are blond. I\'m not suggesting a connection here, but you can understand this investigation has opened up all sorts of interesting possibilities about the biological nature of some of the beings implicated in abduction cases."" These questions will not be easy to answer. But supporting the work of the Anomaly Physical Evidence Group could help.

1954, ,"['UFO Vanishes in FranceThis case was originally brought to light by renown researcher Jacques Vallee, and it is a strange one indeed. Occurring at Nouatre, Indre-et-Loire, France in 1954, it is a case unlike any other, and yet all of the witnesses to the event are considered trustworthy, and their strange sighting has never been debunked. American ufology students have treated this case with little credibility, but serious investigators have embraced it as genuine. It began at a construction site at 4:30 P.M. on September 30, 1954.George Gatay, who was foreman of an eight-man construction crew, was unexpectedly drawn away from his crew, feeling a sense of ""peculiar drowsiness."" He was walking, but did not know why or to where. A short distance from his construction site, Gatay was amazed to encounter a man standing on a slope, some 30 feet from him. The ""man"" was wearing an opaque glass helmet with a large visor. He was wearing gray coveralls, and short boots. He also held an object in his hand, which Gatay described as a weapon of some kind, like a rod. There was a kind of electronic instrument display on his chest. This strange looking man was standing in front of a dome-shaped object, which hovered about 3 feet above the ground.The craft had a cupola with blade-like devices above it. Gatay, enthralled with the sight of the man and his craft, was frozen in his tracks. Gatay stated: ""Suddenly, the strange man vanished, and I couldn\'t explain how he did it, since he did not disappear from my field of vision by walking away, but vanished like an image one erases. Then I heard a strong whistling sound which drowned the noise of our excavators. Soon the object rose by successive jerks, in a vertical direction, and then it too was erased in a sort of blue haze, as if by a miracle.""Gatay had tried to run after first seeing the being and object, but was ""paralyzed"" during the sighting. Strangely, his seven co-workers were also in a sort of a daze during the incident. All eight of the men were ""non-believers"" before their strange incident. As soon as Gatay was released from his strange encounter, he ran back to the other workers, and cried, ""Have you seen something?"" One of the men, Mr. Beurrois, exclaimed, ""Yes--A flying saucer!"" Another of the men, excavator driver Mr. Lubanovic added, ""There was a man dressed like a diver in front of it."" The other workers all added their confirmation to the strange event. Gatay was a well-known and respected man who had fought in the war with the French Resistance, and was wounded in Luxembourg. After the sighting, he began to suffer from insomnia, strong headaches, and a loss of appetite. These symptoms lasted about a week. Even after this strange sighting, the men collectively believed that they had been witnesses to some type of experimental craft, probably from France itself. This explanation was not feasible given the details of the hovering of the craft, and the actual vanishing of the craft in front of the men. What was this other-wordly craft seen by these men? And the being, was it a living entity, or a remotely controlled robot of some type? To this day, no reasonable explanation has been given to answer these questions, and this case is still listed as unexplained.B J Booth sources:Article:  Jacques Vallée, Lumière Dans la Nuit, magazine, numéro 43.

It is just such an observation which once led Dr. Carl Sagan to comment dryly that UFOs ""are more a matter for religion and superstition than they are for science."" While this dismissal is perhaps unscientific in its own right, the point is well taken. Attend any gathering of ""UFO people"" you want, and simply listen. Rumors abound. Perhaps worse, however, is that some of these rumors manage to circulate for years (even decades) without anyone making a reasonable effort to get to the bottom of them. One of the most persistent of these is a story that President Eisenhower visited Edwards Air Force Base in early 1954, and either viewed the bodies of dead aliens and the wreckage of their craft, or met with live aliens on some sort of diplomatic mission to earth. The story takes many forms, with the common thread being that Ike mysteriously disappeared one evening while on a vacation to Palm Springs, and that he was spirited to Edwards to view (or meet) aliens. It is said that he returned by dawn and shortly thereafter ordered absolute secrecy about anything having to do with UFOs. No doubt one of the reasons that this particular rumor has continued to circulate for such a long time is that there are a number of verifiable facts associated with it--some of them rather curious. For example, President Eisenhower did indeed make a trip to Palm Springs between February 17th and 24th, 1954, and on the evening of Saturday, February 20th, he did disappear! When members of the press learned that the president was not where he should be, rumors ran rampant that he had either died or was seriously ill. The story even managed to get onto a press wire before being killed moments later. To quell the fuss, White House Press Secretary James Haggerty called an urgent late evening press conference to announce ""solemnly"" that the president had been enjoying fried chicken earlier that evening, had knocked a cap off a tooth, and had been taken to a local dentist for treatment. When Ike turned up as scheduled the next morning for an early church service, the matter seemed ended. Although the Palm Springs trip was billed as a ""vacation for the president"", the trip appears to have come up rather suddenly. In addition, it is a matter of record that Ike had returned from a quail shooting vacation in Georgia less than a week before leaving for Palm Springs. While the incidence of a local dentist being called upon to treat a president of the United States is unusual enough that it should constitute a rather memorable event for those involved, the dentist\'s widow, in a June, 1979 interview, was curiously unable to recall any specifics relating to her husband\'s alleged involvement in the affair--not even the time of day it had occurred. Yet her memory appeared flawless when asked to relate details of her and her husband\'s attendance (by presidential invitation) at a steak fry the following evening, where her husband was introduced as ""the dentist who had treated the president"". This would appear to suggest a cover story, the details of which would have easily been repeated at the time, but quite naturally forgotten 25 years later. Research at the Eisenhower Library has uncovered two other facts inconsistent with the dentist story. The first is that while the library maintains an extensive index of records relating to the president\'s health, there is no record of any dental work having been performed at all during February, 1954. A file on ""Dentists"" contains nothing concerning any such incident either. Secondly, there is a large file containing copies of all sorts of acknowledgments which were sent by the White House to people who had something to do with the Palm Springs trip. There are letters, for example, to people who sent flowers, people who met the airplane, people who had offered to play golf, etc. There is even a thank you letter to the minister who presided over the Sunday service Ike attended. Yet there is no record of any acknowledgment having been sent to ""the dentist who treated the president."" If the matter were as routine as Haggerty attempts to make it appear, then the absence of these records seems strangely inconsistent. The rumor of the president\'s alleged visit to Edwards is not a new one. UFO contactee fringe writers began making unsupported claims about it less than two months after Ike\'s trip. So did a bizarre fellow from the Hollywood hills named Gerald Light, who, in an April 16, 1954 letter to the head of a Southern California metaphysical organization, actually claimed to have been at Edwards where he saw Ike, the saucers and the aliens. Light\'s letter has been controversial for years and copies of it have turned up in all sorts of places, including the National Enquirer. Investigation into Mr. Light\'s background, however, turned up the fact that he was an elderly mystic who believed that psychic ""out-of-body-experiences"" were a logical extension of the reality of life and should be treated as such. In the final analysis, Light\'s alleged visit to Edwards was just such an experience. And so the story ends. Clearly something unusual occurred involving the president on the evening of February 20, 1954. Whether it was a trip to the dentist, a trip to see flying saucers, or something altogether different and unrelated, no one can say. It\'s the stuff rumors are made of.

1983, ,"['1983-The Albert Burtoo Abduction RejectionAldershot, Hampshire, United KingdomNight Fishing As 77-year-old Alfred Burtoo was fishing the Basingstoke Canal in the peaceful early hours of the morning of August 12, 1983, he saw a brilliant light descend from the sky and settle on the nearby towpath. Thinking it must be a helicopter from the nearby MOD base, he took no notice, and poured himself a cup of tea from his Thermos flask. Then his dog, Tiny, began whining furiously and two figures emerged from the darkness. ""They were about four foot high, dressed in pale green coveralls from head to foot,"" Burtoo told reporters. ""And they had helmets of the same colour with a visor that was blacked out."" The strangers gestured to Burtoo to accompany them. Calmly setting down his cup of tea, the intrepid pensioner follow them along the towpath towards a saucer-shaped craft. ""I was 77 and didn\'t have much to lose,"" he later explained. Inside the Saucer Climbing up a set of steps into the saucer, Burtoo discovered that the ceiling was so low he had to stoop. He found himself inside a black, metallic octagonal chamber, which smelt slightly of decaying meat. ""I did not see any signs of nuts or bolts, nor did I see any seams where the object had been put together,"" he recalled. ""What did interest me most of all was a shaft that rose up from the floor to the ceiling. The shaft was about four feet in circumference, and on the right-hand side stood two forms similar to those that walked along the towpath with me."" One of the beings told the old man to stand beneath an orange light, which appeared to scan him for a few minutes. ""What is your age?"" asked the entity, in a ""sing-song"" voice which sounded like ""a mixture of Chinese and Russian"". When he replied that he was 78, it declared: ""You can go. You are too old and infirm for our purposes."" Bemused, Burtoo climbed down from the saucer and returned to his fishing spot. ""The first thing I did... was to pick up my cold cup of tea and drink it,"" he recalled. ""And then I heard this whining noise, just as if an electric generator was starting up, and this thing lifted up then took off at a very high speed."" Apparently unfazed by his bizarre encounter, Burtoo resumed the task at hand. ""I got into what I had come out for - the fishing!"" Despite his rather curt reception, he later declared his nocturnal adventure to have been ""the greatest experience of my life"". Quality Control? Alfred Burtoo is not alone in having apparently failed an alien medical test. American abductee Carl Higdon believed that he had been rejected as a guinea pig for a hybrid breeding program because his captors discovered that he had had a vasectomy. Likewise, Luis Oswald, an elderly Brazilian abducted in 1979 by beings who claimed to be from ""a small galaxy near Neptune"", reported that she had endured a lengthy examination then been told she was ""of no use"".

Photograph of Burtoo-Timothy Good', 'The Copely Woods, Indiana Encounter, Debbie Jordan-Kauble... in her own words On June 30th, 1983, I found myself face to face with something that cannot be explained, even now. I have always felt as if a part of me died that day and a new \'me\' emerged from that garage.  For those of you who are not familiar with me or my story, or for that matter, why I would even have a website to begin with, I will go over the events of that night one more time. My two small sons and I were living with my parents at the time.  At that time, I was making a little money cutting patterns for a neighbor who made and sold costumes.  My dad was working 2nd shift at a local automotive factory.  Mom and the boys and I had just finished some takeout chicken for supper and I was washing the grease off my hands before I left to go to the neighbors house to cut some more patterns out.  She lived one block over and one road behind us so I wouldn\'t be far in case Mom needed help getting the boys to settle down.  As I stood at the kitchen sink and looked aimlessly out the window, I noticed an odd light coming out of the swimming pool pump house.  First of all, I knew the door SHOULD be closed because I remembered wrestling with the rusty slide lock.  I had been out there just a few hours earlier, putting some more chlorine tabs in the pool floater.  It was getting dark out so the strange light really caught my eye.  It was not like the incandescent bulb that was in there.  It looked more like florescent, white light.  And it was very bright.  I pointed this out to my mother and asked her if she wanted me to stay home. She thought it was odd but told me not to worry about it.  She would lock the doors and if she needed me she would call me.  In the five minutes it took me to get in my car and make a quick detour to the turnabout in back of the house, to check on the light before I left, the light was gone.  And the door to the pump house was closed.  But the pedestrian door to the side garage attached to the house was now open.  I do not know why I didn\'t stop then and go back inside.  I should have but I didn\'t.  I headed on to our neighbors\' house.As soon as I got there, I called my mom.  I told her what I had seen and asked her if she wanted me to come home.  She said, once again, no, she\'d be okay.  I hung up the phone.  Just as soon as I did, it rang. I instinctively picked it up again and somehow was not surprised to hear it was my mom.  She sounded strange, frightened, and she told me to come home.  She said, ""I want you home now.""  My neighbor and her husband were listening to the conversation and at one point, her husband, hearing the panic rise in my voice, yelled into the phone, ""Tell her to call the police, that\'s what they get paid for.""  Mom heard him and she responded with. ""I don\'t want anyone here but you."" I left immediately with a promise to my neighbors to call when I found out what was going on.  It took me all of 3 minutes to get home. Once I arrived, I pulled around to the back of the house again.  This time I stopped at the sun room outside access door and found Mom standing there waiting for me.  As I walked in, I went for the shotgun Daddy had behind the trash compactor.  Mom made a comment about the gun not being loaded and I said to her that whoever was out there didn\'t know that and I could always beat the crap out of them with it.  I have to say, at this point, that I do not know what came over me.  I am no fool and at that time in my life, I was the biggest chicken in the world.  If I had know why mom called me back that night, I would have never gone out back.  I would have gone in the front door, grabbed my mom and kids and high-tailed it out of there so fast it would make your head spin.  She couldn\'t remember why she even called me back until a week later.  (About a week later, while she was doing the dishes or something like that in the kitchen, she suddenly popped out with, ""Oh, I just remembered why I called you back home last weekend!  I had seen a basketball size ball of light around the bird feeder.  It was very soft and I looked around trying to see if someone had a flashlight or something shining on it but I could see nothing.  The light got smaller and smaller and as soon as it disappeared, I got the thought in my head to call you home.)  See what I mean?  I took the gun and walked out into the dark back yard.  I went to the pump house and looking inside.  Nothing.  I decided to walk out near the big garage out back to see if I could find my dog.  (She had been in the garage attached to the house because she was in heat at the time.)  I found her. She was firmly lodged under my dad\'s old ladder truck.  I grabbed at her and tried to get her to come out.  Normally, she would be all over me like a cheap suit.  She was MY dog.  But something had scared the hell out of her.  She was yelping and whining and tearing at my hands to let go of her.  So I did.  Then I decided I\'d better check out the garage.  Something had obviously freaked her out and whatever it was, it had been in the garage at one time.  I went in there, gun first, cussing and yelling at the top of my lungs.  The place was empty.  I looked behind old mattresses and everything else in there and didn\'t find a thing.  As soon as I had decided that I wasn\'t gonna find anyone in here, I suddenly felt as if I was on fire.  All the skin on my body started burning.  It felt like I was covered with acid.  And I thought, ""I\'ve gotta get out of here RIGHT NOW!""  I turned to run out the pedestrian door and that is when I was hit in the chest by something VERY bright and electrifying. I have never been hit by lightening.  But if I could imagine what it would feel like, I would say it was like this.  It felt as if I had first been punched by a huge, electric fist, right in the gut.  The burning, electrical feeling slowly moved down my legs to my feet, out my arms to my fingertips and around my head.  Then, I could feel every molecule of my body vibrating.  I couldn\'t move.  And I couldn\'t see because the flash was so bright.  I know I could not have tolerated more than a few seconds of this but I swear it felt as if this lasted for several minutes.  I assume it couldn\'t have lasted more than a few seconds.  I remember thinking, ""I\'m DEAD!  This is what it feels like to die.""  I was shaking and burning and I felt like I was vibrating to my very core.  The brightness wore off fast. Then, the vibrating and shaking subsided.  But I still couldn\'t move.  I was able to see bits and pieces.  VERY much like having been \'flashed\' in the eye by a camera flash.  I had big blind spots in my vision but I could see some shadow and some movement in the yard in front of my.  I can now feel someone pulling on my right shoulder, as if to pull me down a bit.  Then, I felt a stabbing, burning sensation in my right ear.  And I could hear someone telling me it was unfortunate that I had to feel pain.  Then, I was OUTSIDE the pedestrian doorway but I didn\'t know how I got there.  I could see a soft, white ball of light directly in front of me.  It was about the size of a basketball and is hovering about as high as I am tall.  (5\' 3 1/2 "")  The light slowly moved up and down, as if it were looking at me from head to foot.  Then, it moved into the egg shaped thing and disappeared.Just to the left of the light, I could see something about the size of the pool pump house.  Maybe 8 to 10 feet tall and shaped like an egg.  (Not very big as far as UFOs go.) And I could see 6 people in the yard in front of me.  They are at various spots in the yard.  At the same time, they all seemed to line up and slide to the left, back to this egg shaped thing in front of me. They were smaller than me.  Shorter.  I thought they looked like children.  Bullet shaped children.  Bigger in the head and getting narrow at the feet.  I couldn\'t see much detail, mostly just silhouettes. The rest of this event is still a blur after 20 years.  The next thing I remember is hearing someone say. ""It\'s over.""  I suddenly remembered my kids.  I thought, ""MY KIDS!  Oh my God!""  And immediately I heard the voice say that my kids were okay.  I heard my name being called and I was able to move and I turned and began to walk up the lower porch steps, toward the back kitchen door.  With each step I took, the memory of what had just transpired, faded until by the time I reached my mom at the back door, I did not remember anything after I entered the garage.  I said to my mom, ""Everything\'s cool.""  And with that, she became animated again.  It was as if she was standing there, in a daze, until she heard my voice. I left mom and went back to the neighbors\' house.  When I got there, she was upset with me.  She said they were about ready to call the police because I didn\'t call them like I said I would and they were worried that I was taking so long.  It seems I was gone about 2 hours but I only remembered about 15 minutes worth of experience.  I had no explanation for that and her inquiry just left me even foggier than I was already feeling.  I didn\'t feel good and told her that I would rather swim than sew.  (After the experience, I felt \'icky\' and like I had to \'get wet\'.)  I invited her to come swim with me and she agreed.  She gathered up her 14 year old daughter and the three of us went back to mom and dad\'s.  As we were walking out the pool, my dad pulled up in the drive.  He always came home at about 11:10 PM.  I left to go to the neighbors\' just before 8:00 P.M.  Three hours had passed and I couldn\'t account for most of it. As we walked though the back yard to the swimming pool, my neighbors\' daughter suddenly jumped and yelled, ""OUCH.""  She said she had stepped on something that made her foot burn, and now her foot was getting numb.  By the time we reached the pool, she said her foot felt numb all the way to the knee, but yet she could walk on it.  We weren\'t in the pool more than 10 or 15 minutes when we all started feeling nauseated, and my eyesight started getting real fuzzy, even though I had not had my head under water.  I could see halos around all the outside lights and it was making me dizzy.  The girls left and I went to bed. When I woke up the next morning, I could not open my eyes.  They were swollen completely shut.  My mother took me to the emergency room.  They, in turn, sent me directly to an eye specialist across the street from the ER because they didn\'t have anyone on call in ER who was able to treat something like this.  This doctor was just across the street and agreed to work me in and see me that morning.  He was stunned at the extent of my injury.  He kept asking me if I had looked into the arc of a welder\'s torch or the sun.  I had not.  I was given several tubes of cream and some drops to try to heal my eyes.  It took SEVERAL weeks for them to fully recover and to this day, my eyes are VERY sensitive to light.  And my vision is very far-sighted.  Sometimes my eyes will still suddenly burn and turn red, for no apparent reason.  Fortunately, this only lasts for a few minutes. For whatever unknown reasons, no one in the house even looked out back for the rest of the week.  Come the weekend, 4th of July weekend, the rest of my family was all over to swim and have a cookout.  My nephew was the first one to notice the mark in the yard. It was an 8 foot circle with a 20 foot swath coming off it.  The swath ended in a perfect arch and was exactly 2 feet wide.  All the grass in this mark was brownish gray and wilted.  The dirt was gray and hard.  There were a could have deep cracks around the edge of the circle.  I dropped a 12 inch ruler down one crack and we never did find it. The first thing my mother said when she saw that mark was, ""Oh, that\'s where our UFO landed.""  I just looked at her like she was nuts and I thought to myself, ""What is wrong with her?\'  Suddenly, as I looked at this mark, I began to panic. I could feel my pulse race, the sweat beading on my brow.  I started feeling faint.  And I started remembering.  (WITHOUT hypnosis.)The aftermath of this day was a nightmare for several years.  I was \'shell shocked\'.  I sat up at night, watching over my children and waiting.  Waiting for something.  But I didn\'t remember what it was I was waiting for.  I got sick and stayed sick for over a year.  I developed life-threatening allergies, rashes, fevers, swollen glands, diarrhea, bleeding gums and my hair started falling out.  My fingernails started growing thin, peeled and had horizontal ridges in them.  I developed irregular heartbeats  (PAC\'s)  I started having panic attacks.  Almost daily for a long time.  And the dog that was out there with me that night?  She had to be put to sleep about 2 and a half months later.  All her hair fell out from the head down.  She developed black, oozing sores all over her back, her eyes got milky white and she was obviously going deaf.  Her teeth all fell out and her gums bled, as well.  When we took her to the vet, he was shocked to see how quickly she had deteriorated.  She was not that old (about 6 or 7 years) and the way she looked you would have thought she was 20 years old.  He advised us to put her down because he felt she was suffering and he could not help her.  He figured she was \'eaten up\' with cancer of some kind. The mark in the yard remained there for nearly five years.  Every year snow melted off of it.  Animals would not walk on it.  There were no bugs in the soil.  Even when the grass finally did begin to grow back, the grass in that place was thick, rubbery and kind of a bluish green color.  The dandelions that grew around the mark were three times the size of normal ones.  The tomato plants my mom had out by the pool, were the size of grapefruits but when you tried to eat them, they were so acidic the skin on your lips would peel off.  And the vines were as big around as my forearm.  The leaves on a patch of trees behind the mark withered, turned brown and fell off.  The power line above the mark shorted out and blew a transformer, melted the wiring and blew out the tubes on the Heathkit HAM radios in the basement of the house, which was right next to the place in the yard. Eventually, there were a couple of neighbors who came forward to say they had experienced strange things in their home the very night I had the experience, and one neighbor behind us who witness \'hundreds\' of basketball size balls of white light, floating through the woods around the night I had my experience. Budd Hopkins spent a ton of his own money doing a very thorough investigation of that night.  I sold my washer and dryer to get a ticket to New York.  I was subjected to an array of medical and psychological tests and even passed a voice stress (lie detector) test.  Budd eventually wrote a book about my experiences and my family, titled:  ""Intruders, The Incredible Visitations at Copely Woods"".   In 1992, CBS did a mini series of the same name, with some excerpts from the book as scenes, starring Mare Winningham as me.   And later still, in 1993, my sister Kathy Mitchell, and I wrote a follow up book titled,  ""Abducted!  The Story of the Intruders Continues.""  I think of my dog, and the fate she met. In my heart, I believe whatever she encountered that night was directly related to her untimely death. And there is a part of me that STILL worries I will eventually have some kind of cancer related to my experience of that night. There is nothing I can do about it right now, except take good care of myself and hope for the best. I often wonder what my life would have been like had I not had the experience. I can\'t imagine. Truthfully, despite the obvious trauma, I don\'t think I would change a thing. I have become a much stronger person. I don\'t give credit to the experience or the \'Intruders\', other than it FORCED ME to be strong, to survive and grow. And I kinda like that about me. That is the story of this day.  You know when you can name the date and time of an event, it MUST have made quite an impression on you.  June 30th, 1983, made such an impression on me that it actually crushed the old me while molding the new one.  Now THAT\'S a defining moment.Peace,Deb(Debbie Jordan-Kauble)source:http://debshome.home.insightbb.com/20th_Anniversary6302003.htmlposted-June 30, 2003']"
1986, ,"['1986-UFO Seen from Bridge of USS Edenton While in the US Navy in the summer of 1986, I was standing lookout aboard the USS Edenton ATS 1 (currently decommissioned). The lookout watch, stood outside on top the bridge of the ship, and was responsible for reporting all contacts seen both in the water and sky. It was around eleven p.m. one clear night at sea, located about fifty miles off the coast of Cape Hatteras, NC. During one of my scans of the night sky, out of know where, four red circular lights appeared. The lights where hundreds of yards apart from each other and formed a square. At first, I thought it was four separate air craft, such as, military helicopters because the lights were stationary; however, due to the distance from the ship, the lights where too large to be aircraft running lights. There were also no other normal running lights like green and white, which make-up the normal outline of an aircraft seen at night. The lights where located about twenty degrees above the horizon and about a mile away from the ship. Again, these four red lights were each about the size of a small plane, which were very bright and visible in the night sky. The night sky was also clear, moon lit, and a moderate amount of stars were visible, which also aided in calculating the distance and size of these lights. As stated, when I first saw these lights they were all stationary in the sky and appeared out of know where. Once I noticed that these were not normal lights, grouped in a square and not moving, I called down to the bridge over a salt and pepper line informing the conning officer of a possible UFO sighting. This brought laughter across the wire at first, but I relayed the contact again in a stern but excited voice, which succeeded in getting the bridge officers attention. After relaying the contact information a second time, the four lights, in a flash, darted towards the horizon amazingly fast. The lower two lights in the square went first, with the top two lights following directly behind them in a curved swooshing motion and there was no sound. Then all four shot straight up into outer-space and out of sight, all within a split second. At this point, I felt very excited and shocked, and was personally praying someone on the bridge had seen what I just saw. Having been an avid watcher of the night sky, seen shooting stars and a believer in that life has to exist somewhere out there, I become even more excited because I knew, I just saw my first unidentified flying object(s). To my amazement, when I returned to the bridge after my watch, I was very pleased to learn that the conning officer and everyone else on the bridge had seen this sighting and logged it into the ship’s log as a UFO sighting. Next, after a half hour had passed since the sighting, the radiation detection system (gamma roentgen meter) on the bridge started making a loud clicking sound. At first, no one seemed to know what was making this sound then a very loud bell went off notifying us as to what was going on, we were being radiated. When the instrument stopped clicking, it indicated we had taken a hit of 385 roentgens in the period of about one minute. At this point, the captain of the ship was awoken and called to the bridge, as well as the chief in charge of the radiation metering equipment onboard ship. The captain was not impressed with an entry of a UFO sighting being placed in the ship’s log, and at first, took the roentgen meter as being defective. However, the chief informed the captain that the meter had been serviced and calibrated the day before and that other like meters throughout the ship had just gone off indicating the same amount of roentgens received as the bridge. The captain stated not to log the instance concerning the radiation exposure and left the bridge. During the rest of my watch duty that night, no officer or enlisted person spoke of what happened, and also acted liked nothing happened. This experience, however, was etched into my memory as if it happened yesterday and I have told this story to only a few people, people who I thought would believe me. This is also the first time I have documented the events of this night. In conclusion, as an indication of the strength of gamma radiation, I and others received that night; all the personnel during the Project Trinity experiments conducted in 1945 at ground zero, only received between 1 and 6 total roentgens of gamma radiation. This leads me to believe, we traveled through the wake of radiation produced by the UFOs seen thirty minutes earlier.

Source & References:www.mufoncms.com', ' 1986 Japanese Airline 1628 Encounters UFONovember 17, 1986 Over Northeastern AlaskaIt was just a routine flight. Well, not exactly routine... It was a special Japan Air Lines 747 cargo flight to carry a load of French wine from Paris to Tokyo. The flight plan would carry flight 1628 from Paris to Reykjavik, Iceland, across the North Atlantic and Greenland, then across Canada to Anchorage, Alaska, and finally across the Pacific to Tokyo. The crew consisted of veteran Captain Kenju Terauchi, co-pilot Takanori Tamefuji, and flight engineer Yoshio Tsukuba. On November 16, 1986, laden with wine, JAL1628 took off from Paris and flew the first leg of the trip, to Reykjavik. The next day, they continued, flying over Greenland and then across northern Canada without event. Just after they crossed into Alaska, at 5:09 PM local time, Anchorage Air Traffic Control contacted them on the radio to report initial radar contact. The Anchorage flight controller asked them to turn 15 degrees to the left and head for a point known as Talkeetna on a heading of 215 degrees. They were at 35,000 feet and traveling at a ground speed of about 600 mph. At about 5:11 PM local time, Captain Terauchi noticed the lights of some sort of aircraft about 2000 feet below and 30 degrees to the left front of them. He decided that the aircraft was probably an American jet fighter from nearby Eielson or Elmendorf Air Force Bases patrolling Alaskan airspace, so he ignored them at first. However, after a few minutes, he noticed that the lights were keeping pace with his own aircraft, which would be an unusual thing for patrolling jets to do. It was about seven or so minutes since we began paying attention to the lights (when), most unexpectedly, two spaceships stopped in front of our face, shooting off lights. The inside cockpit shined brightly and I felt warm in the face. Terauchi said that it was his impression that the two objects he had seen below them minutes before had suddenly jumped in from of him. The craft, one above the other, kept pace with the 747 for several minutes, moving in unison with an odd rocking motion. After about seven minutes, they changed to a side-by-side arrangement. Terauchi said that the ""amber and whitish"" lights were like flames coming out of multiple rocket exhaust ports arranged in two rectangular rows on the craft. He felt that they fired in a particular sequence to stabilize the craft, much like the small maneuvering thrusters on the Space Shuttle. He also reported seeing sparks like a fire when using gasoline or carbon fuel. Co-pilot Tamefuji described the lights as ""Christmas assorted"" lights with a ""salmon"" color. He said: I remember red or orange, and white landing light, just like a landing light. And weak green, ah, blinking. He also described the lights as pulsating slowly. They became stronger, became weaker., became stronger, became weaker, different from strobe lights.The lights were ""swinging"" in unison as if there were ""very good formation flight... close"" of two aircraft side by side. He described the appearance of the lights as similar to seeing ""night flight head-on traffic,"" where it is only possible to see the lights on an approaching aircraft and ""we cannot see the total shape."" He said, I\'m sure I saw something. It was clear enough to make me believe that there was an oncoming aircraft. Flight engineer Tsukuba, who sat behind the copilot, did not have as good a view of the lights. He first saw them ""through the L1 window at the 11 o\'clock position,"" and he saw ""clusters of lights undulating."" These clusters were ""made of two parts... shaped like windows of an airplane."" He emphasized that ""the lights in front of us were different from town lights."" He described the colors as white or amber. Tamefuji decided to call Anchorage Air Traffic Control, and for the next thirty minutes the 747 and AARTCC were in constant contact regarding the UFO. During this time, Captain Terauchi asked Tskububa to hand him a camera so that he could attempt to take a photograph of the lights. However, Terauchi was unfamiliar with the camera and could not get it to operate. Tsukuba also could not get his camera to operate due to problems with the auto-focus and finally gave up trying to take a photo. At this point they began experiencing some radio interference and were asked by Anchorage to change frequencies. Terauchi later said that Anchorage kept asking him about clouds in the immediate area: They asked us several times if there were clouds near our altitude. We saw thin and spotty clouds near the mountain below us, no clouds in mid-to-upper air, and the air current was steady. Soon after the exchanges about clouds, the objects flew off to the left. Terauchi said later: ""There was a pale white flat light in the direction where the ships flew away, moving in a line along with us, in the same direction and same speed and at the same altitude as we were."" Terauchi decided to see whether they could see anything on the 747\'s own radar: ""I thought it would be impossible to find anything on an aircraft radar if a large ground radar did not show anything, but I judged the distance of the object visually and it was not very far. ""I set the digital weather radar distance to 20 (nautical) miles, radar angle to horizon (i.e., no depression angle). There it was on the screen. A large green and round object had appeared at 7 or 8 miles (13 km to 15 km) away, where the direction of the object was."" We reported to Anchorage center that our radar caught the object within 7 or 8 miles in the 10 o\'clock position. We asked them if they could catch it on ground radar, but it did not seem they could catch it at all.""At 5:25:45, after spending two minutes looking, the military radar at Elmendorf Regional Operational Control Center also picked up something. The ROCC radar controller reported back to the AARTCC that he was getting some ""surge primary return."" By this he meant an occasional radar echo unaccompanied by a transponder signal. As the 747 neared Fairbanks: ""The lights (of the city) were extremely bright to eyes that were used to the dark. (The cockpit lights had been turned off to eliminate window reflections of internal lights.) We were just above the bright city lights and we checked the pale white light behind us."" Alas! There was a silhouette of a gigantic spaceship.""We must run away quickly! Anchorage Center."" The JAL1628 is requesting a change of course to right 45 degrees."" It felt like a long time before we received permission."" Just after the plane turned to the right, the AARTCC controller called the Fairbanks Approach Radar controller to find out whether or not the short-range radar had a target near the JAL. The approach radar reported no target other than JAL1628.The plane came out of the turn and flew toward Talkeetna at an altitude of 31,000 ft, with the object still following. At about 5:40, a United Airlines passenger jet took off from Anchorage and headed north to Fairbanks. The AARTCC controller decided to ask the UA pilot to try to see the object that was following the JAL flight. The UA pilot said he would look when he got closer. The controller asked the JAL flight to stay at 31,000 ft, and the UA flight to stay at 29,000 ft. He then directed the UA flight to turn some more so that the planes would pass within five miles of one another. As the United Airlines jet got closer, the UFO apparently dropped behind, allowing the JAL plane to get far ahead. The United pilot asked the AARTCC to have the JAL pilot flash the headlights on the JAL aircraft so he could locate the plane. At 5:49:45 the JAL pilot did that. At this point the planes were about 25 miles apart. When the planes were about 12 miles apart, the UA plane reported seeing the JAL plane and nothing else. But by this time the UFO had apparently disappeared, not being seen by JAL1628, either. At about 5:51, the AARTCC requested that a military TOTEM flight in the area also fly toward the JAL plane for a look. During the next several minutes TOTEM viewed the JAL plane, but couldn\'t see any other traffic. JAL1628 proceeded to Anchorage and landed at 6:20 PM. The FAA conducted an investigation of the incident, and did not issue its final report until March 5. CSICOP\'s (Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal) Phil Klass issued a premature statement on January 22 claiming that the UFOs were the planets Jupiter and Mars - an impossible solution because the UFO was seen in a part of the sky opposite the position of these planets and because the UFOs moved from positions one above the other to side by side. CSICOP later issued a second explanation that the UFO was light reflecting off of clouds of ice crystals - also unlikely because the sky was clear at the reported altitude of the UFO. The FAA attributed the radar images received by ground radar to a ""split radar return from the JAL Boeing 747.""Loy Lawhon Also See UFO Casebook\'s 1986 - JAL 1628 Pilot\'s Story Surfaces']"
1956, ,"['1956, Driver Describes ""Big Flying Saucer"" Over South Dakota  The Bismarck Tribune; Friday, November 16, 1956. REDFIELD, S.D. -- A young truck driver who said he ""never held any stock in flying saucer stories"" told Wednesday of seeing a huge object in the sky that changed colors and moved with tremendous speed.   Others, including three newspapermen, also reported seeing the object at great distance.   Marlen Hewitt, driver for a dairy here, told this story of wacthing the object as he drove a tank truck from Pelican Rapids, Minn., to Redfield:   ""It was about 1:15 when I first spotted it as I drove along. At first I thought it was a star, I\'ve never seen a star that bright. There were other stars out at the time, and only a few high clouds in the sky.   ""As I went on down the road toward Graceville, it changed colors a couple of times. Near Graceville, it changed colors four times.   ""I thought my eyes were playing tricks with me. I stopped, turned off the lights and got out of the truck to stretch my legs. As I rounded the back of the truck, this thing swooped down about a half mile to the east of me and stopped about 1,000 feet up.   ""I was very frightened -- I was terrified.   ""If it had been on the ground, it would have covered about a square block. It looked to be about 12 feet thick. It was a slate gray color, and from the distance looked like it was metal. It was round, and at the base was an opening about 1/10th the size of the object from which a very brilliant light was shining.   ""It would tilt around and back and forth, gaining maybe 3,000 or 4,000 feet in the flick of any eye.   ""Around the edge of this thing was a lighted outline. I couldn\'t tell if there were windows in the lighted part or if there was exhaust coming out all around it.   ""It would change colors from a blue-white to orange to red. I wanted to get out of there, so I jumped back into the truck and turned on the lights.   ""When my lights went on, the thing turned a bright cherry red and shot up into the high clouds. It moved faster than anything I ever saw.   ""As I drove toward Ortonville, it dropped down and went to the southwest at a tremendous rate of speed. Then it stopped and hovered.   ""I could still see the light in the cloud when I got to Ortonville, and some editors who were going hunting came out of an eating place and watched it with me.   ""After I got to Big Stone City, it came down out of the clouds again, further away but still changing colors.""   Hewitt said the object disappeared about five hours after he had first spotted the bright light in the sky. He had traveled about 150 miles in the meantime.   He said the roads were ""very deserted"" at the time and that as far as he knew the only others to see the object were those at Ortonville.   Hewitt said the object mde no noise. He added there was a little wind at the time the object was at its lowest level and it seemed to move into and away from the wind with equal speed.   Among the hunters who saw the object at Ortonville were three newspapermen, Lem Kaercher of the Ortonville Independent and Don and Dick Olson of the Marshall Messenger.   published by NICAP, Copyright 1964 By Michael GoodspeedThunderbolts.info10-31-4www.rense.com', '1956: UFO Encounter / Jet Chase Over Bentwaters AFB, U. K.Because of the major importance of the 1980 UFO landings in Rendlesham Forest near the RAF / USA joint bases of Bentwaters and Woodbridge, another important, well documented UFO sighting at Bentwaters is often overlooked.Observations of unidentified objects by USAF and RAF personnel, extending over 5 hours, and involving ground-radar, airborne-radar, ground visual and airborne-visual sightings of high-speed unconventionally maneuvering objects in the vicinity of two RAF stations at night make this case a true ""unexplained."". It is Case 2 in the Condon Report and is there conceded to be unexplained. On the night of August 13-14, 1956, radar operators at two military bases in the east of England repeatedly tracked single and multiple objects which displayed high speed, as well as rapid changes of speed and direction. Two jet interceptors were sent up, and were able to see and track them in a brief series of maneuvers. According to official U.S. Air Force reports, the sightings could not be explained by radar malfunction or by unusual weather.It began at 9:30 p.m. when Airman 2nd Class John Vaccare, of the U.S. Air Force at RAF Bentwaters, tracked one UFO on his Ground Controlled Approach radar (type AN/MPN-11A) as it flew 40-50 miles (65 to 80 km.) in 30 seconds, i.e. 4,800 to 6,000 mph (7,500 to 9,500 km./hr.). A few minutes later Vaccare reported to T/Sergeant L. Whenry that a group of 12 to 15 unidentified targets was tracked from 8 miles (13 km.) southwest of Bentwaters to 40 miles (65 km.) northeast, at which time they ""appeared to converge into one very large object, according to the size of the blip on the radar scope, which seemed to be several times larger than a B-36 aircraft [the largest operational bomber in history, with a wingspan of 230 feet or 70 m.]."" The single large blip stopped twice for several minutes while being tracked, before flying off the scope. At 10 p.m., a single unidentified target was tracked from Bentwaters as it covered 55 miles (90 km.) in just 16 seconds. This works out to over 12,000 mph (19,000 km./hr.). Then, at 10:55 p.m., the Bentwaters GCA radar picked up an unidentified target on the same east-to-west course as the previous one, at an apparent speed of ""2,000 to 4,000 mph"" (3,200 to 6,400 km./hr.). Someone in the Bentwaters control tower reported seeing ""a bright light passing over the field from east to west at about 4,000 feet [1,200 m.]."" At about the same time, the pilot of a C-47 twin-engine military transport plane over Bentwaters said, ""a bright light streaked under my aircraft travelling east to west at terrific speed."" All three reports coincided. Soon after, radars at Bentwaters and RAF Lakenheath reported a stationary object 20-25 miles (32-40 km.) southwest of the latter base. It suddenly began moving north at 400 to 600 mph (650 to 1,000 km./hr.), but ""there was no build-up to this speed - it was constant from the second it started to move until it stopped."" It made several abrupt changes of direction without appearing to slow for its turns. Around 11:30 p.m., the RAF launched a deHavilland Venom jet interceptor, from RAF Waterbeach. According to the U.S. Air Force UFO report: ""Pilot advised he had a bright white light in sight and would investigate. At 13 miles [20 km.] west he reported loss of target and white light. Lakenheath (radar) vectored him to a target 10 miles [16 km.] east of Lakenheath and pilot advised (that) target was on his radar and was \'locking on.\' Pilot then reported he had lost target on his radar.""Lakenheath GCA reports that as the Venom passed the target on radar, the target began a tail chase of the friendly fighter. Radar requested pilot acknowledge this chase. Pilot acknowledged and stated he would try to circle and get behind the target. Pilot advised he was unable to \'shake\' the target off his tail and requested assistance.""One additional Venom was scrambled from RAF station. Original pilot stated: \'Clearest target I have ever seen on radar.""The following conversation between the two Venom fighter pilots was heard by the Lakenheath watch supervisor: ""Did you see anything?"" [Pilot #2] ""I saw something, but I\'ll be damned if I know what it was."" [Pilot #1] ""What happened?"" [Pilot #2] ""He - or it - got behind me and I did everything I could to get behind him and I couldn\'t. It\'s the damndest thing I\'ve ever seen."" [Pilot #1] The 1969 report by the Air Force-funded study at the University of Colorado under Dr. Edward U. Condon concluded: ""In summary, this is the most puzzling and unusual case in the radar-visual files. The apparent rational, intelligent behavior of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of this sighting. However, in view of the inevitable fallibility of witnesses, more conventional explanations of this report cannot be entirely ruled out."" USAF Air Intelligence Information Report filed by Captain Edward L. Holt, August 31, 1956. RAF CONTROLLER ACCOUNT:This is the little-known but definitive account by F.H.C. Wimbledon, RAF Fighter Controller on duty at RAF Neatishead, Norfolk: ""I was Chief Controller on duty at the main RAF Radar Station in East Anglia on the night in question. My duties were to monitor the radar picture and to scramble the Battle Flight, who were on duty 24 hours a day, to intercept any intruder of British airspace not positively identified in my sector of responsibility."" ""I remember Lakenheath USAF base telephoning to say there was some thing ""buzzing"" their airfield circuit. I scrambled a Venom night fighter from the Battle Flight through Sector and my controller in the Interception Cabin took over control of it. The Interception Control team would consist of one Fighter Controller (an Officer), a Corporal, a tracker and a height reader. That is, four highly trained personnel in addition to myself could now clearly see the object on our radarscopes."" ""After being vectored onto the trail of the object by my Interception Controller, the pilot called out, ""Contact,"" then a short time later, ""Judy,"" which meant the Navigator had the target fairly and squarely on his own radar screen and needed no further help from the ground. He continued to close on the target but after a few seconds, and in the space of one or two sweeps of our scopes, the object appeared behind our fighter. Our pilot called out, ""Lost Contact, more help,"" and he was told the target was now behind him and he was given fresh instructions."" ""I then scrambled a second Venom which was vectored toward the area but before it arrived on the scene the target had disappeared from our scopes and although we continued to keep a careful watch was not seen by us."" ""The fact remains that at least nine RAF ground personnel and two RAF aircrew were conscious of an object sufficiently ""solid"" to give returns on radar. Naturally, all this was reported and a Senior Officer from the Air Ministry came down and interrogated us.""THE CONDON REPORT CASE:Lakenheath, England, 13-14 August 1956The Condon Report: 2230-0330 LST. Weather: generally clear until 0300 LST on the 14th. (For details see Section IV.) The probability that anomalous propagation of radar signals may have been involved in this case seems to be small. One or two details are suggestive of AP, particularly the reported disappearance of the first track as the UFO appeared to overfly the Bentwaters GCA radar. Against this must be weighed the Lakenheath controller\'s statement that there was ""little or no traffic or targets on scope,"" which is not at all suggestive of AP conditions, and the behavior of the target near Lakenheath - apparently continuous and easily tracked. The ""tailing"" of the RAF fighter, taken alone, seems to indicate a possible ghost image, but this does not jibe with the report that the UFO stopped following the fighter, as the latter was returning to its base, and went off in a different direction. The radar operators were apparently careful to calculate the speed of the UFO from distances and elapsed times, and the speeds were reported as consistent from run to run, between stationary episodes. This behavior would be somewhat consistent with reflections from moving atmospheric layers - but not in so many different directions. Visual mirage at Bentwaters seems to be out of the question because of the combined ground and airborne observations; the C47 pilot apparently saw the UFO below him. The visual objects do not seem to have been meteors; statements by the observers that meteors were numerous imply that they were able to differentiate the UFO from the meteors. In summary, this is the most puzzling and unusual case in the radar-visual files. The apparently rational, intelligent behavior of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of this sighting. However, in view of the inevitable fallibility of witnesses, more conventional explanations of this report cannot be entirely ruled out. sources:""UFOs over Lakenheath in 1956"", by James E.

The government moved the flying saucer to a remote area called Wild Fork, where they ran tests on it, eventually figuring out how to fly this spaceship. The above photo was taken by a government official during one of the many test flights. At sunset on July 17, 1956, Miles Oman, a farmer in Jasper, Colorado, was getting ready to call it a day. He was walking back to his house when this strange, oval-shaped object in the sky caught his eye. It looked like a spaceship. The object zipped across the sky and was gone. This sighting kicked off one of the most amazing UFO incidents in the history of the world. For approximately two months, the town of Jasper and the surrounding areas experienced one unusual event after another. Scientists rushed in to investigate, reporters rushed in looking for stories, and government officials rushed in to keep it a secret from the world.

The lead came in a brief message from AdmiralDelmar S. Fahrney, former Navy missile chief, whom I had known for years.""Captain James Taylor, USN, Rte., has an important UFO sighting made by anaval pilot and his crew. Call him at Spacetronics, Inc., in Washington,District 7-9481.""That night, when Captain Taylor gave me this dramatic Navy report, I couldsee why it had never been released to the public. Later, Admiral Fahrneyand I met at the Army-Navy Club and discussed the details. Fahrney knew,as well as I did, of other hidden UFO cases - some of them highlysignificant. But this one stood out in importance.It had happened in 1956. Cruising at 19,000 feet, a Navy R7V-2 transport - a four-engine Super-Constellation - was flying west across the AtlanticOcean. The next stop was Gander, Newfoundland. Final destination, NavalAir Station, Patuxent, Maryland.The night was clear, visibility unlimited. In the senior pilot\'s seat,Commander George Benton was checking the dim-lit instruments. At thirty-four,Benton had a decade of Navy flying behind him. He had made the Atlanticcrossing more than two hundred times. Back in the cabin were two extraNavy air crews, en route home from foreign duty. Most of these men wereasleep. Including Benton\'s regular and relief crews, there were nearly30 airmen-pilots, navigators and flight engineers aboard the Constellation.As Commander Benton finished his cockpit check, he glanced out at the stars.Then he leaned forward, puzzled. A few minutes before, the sea below hadbeen dark. Now there was a cluster of lights, like a village, abouttwenty-five miles ahead.Benton looked over at his co-pilot, Lieutenant Peter W. Mooney. ""What doyou make of those lights?"" Mooney peered down, startled.""Looks like a small town!""""That\'s what I thought."" Benton quickly called the navigator, LieutenantAlfred C. Erdman. ""We must be way off course. There\'s land down there.""""It can\'t be land."" Erdman hurried forward from his map table. ""That laststar sight shows..."" He broke off, staring down at the clustered lights.""Well?"" said Benton. ""They must be ships,"" said Erdman. ""Maybe a rendezvousfor some special operation.""Giant Flying Saucers""They don\'t look like ships,"" said Benton. He called Radioman John Wiggins.No word of any unusual ship movements, Wiggins reported. And no signals fromthe location of the lights. If they were ships, they were keeping radiosilence. ""Wake up those other crews,"" Benton told Erdman. ""Maybe somebodycan dope it out."" In a few moments, two or three airmen crowded into thecockpit. Benton cut off the automatic pilot, banked to give them and the menin the cabin a better view.As the transport began to circle, the strange lights abruptly dimmed. Thenseveral colored rings appeared, began to spread out. One, Benton noticed,seemed to be growing in size. Behind him, someone gave an exclamation.Benton took another look. That luminous ring wasn\'t on the surface - itwas something rushing up toward the transport.""What the devil is it?"" said Mooney. ""Don\'t know,"" muttered Benton. Herolled the Constellation out of its turn to start a full-power climb. Thenhe saw it was useless. The luminous ring could catch them in seconds.The glow, he now saw, came from the rim of some large, round object. Itreached their altitude, swiftly took shape as a giant disc-shaped machine.Dwarfing the Constellation, it raced in toward them. ""It\'s going to hit us!""said Erdman. Benton had known normal fear, but this was nightmare. Numbed,he waited for the crash.Suddenly the giant disc tilted. Its speed sharply reduced, it angled on pastthe port wing. The commander let out his breath. He looked at Mooney\'s whiteface, saw the others\' stunned expressions. Watching out the port window, hecautiously started to bank. He stopped as he saw the disc.It had swung around, was drawing abreast, pacing them at about one hundredyards. For a moment he had a clear glimpse of the monster. Its sheer bulkwas amazing; its diameter was three to four times the Constellation\'s wingspan. At least thirty feet thick at the center, it was like a gigantic dishinverted on top of another. Seen at this distance, the glow along the rimwas blurred and uneven. Whether it was an electrical effect, a series ofjet exhausts or lights from opening in the rim, Benton could not tell. Butthe glow was bright enough to show the disc\'s curving surface, giving a hintof dully reflecting metal.Though Benton saw no signs of life, he had a feeling they were being observed.Fighting an impulse to dive away, he held to a straight course. Gradually, thestrange machine pulled ahead. Tilting its massive shape upward, it quicklyaccelerated and was lost against the stars.Commander Benton reached for his microphone, called Gander Airport andidentified himself. ""You show any other traffic out here?"" he asked thetower. ""We had something on the scope near you,"" Gander told him. ""But wecouldn\'t get an answer.""""We saw it,"" Benton said grimly. ""It was no aircraft."" He gave the towera concise report, and back at Gander teletype messages were rushed to theU.S. Air Defense Command, the Commanding Officer, Eastern Sea Frontier, theDirector of Air Force Intelligence and the Air Technical Intelligence Center.When the Constellation landed at Gander, Air Force intelligence officers metthe transport. From the start, it was plain they accepted the giant discsighting as fact. For two hours, Benton and the rest were carefullyinterrogated[debriefed], separately and together: How close did the objectcome? What was its size... estimated rate of climb... any electricalinterference noted... what happened to the other luminous rings?From the answers to scores of questions, the majority opinion emerged. Theflying disc was between 350 and 400 feet in diameter, and apparently metallic.No interference with ignition noted; instruments not observed and radio notoperating during this brief period. Time for the giant disc to climb to thetransport\'s altitude, between five and eight seconds, indicated speed between1,400 and 2,200 knots; the disc had accelerated above this speed on departure.Not all the men in the cabin had seen the luminous rings. Of those who had,most were watching the huge disc approach and did not see the ""rings""disappear. If they, too, were flying discs, in a rendezvous as somesuggested, they apparently had raced off while the other one was checkingon the Constellation.At one point, an Intelligence captain asked Benton if he had seen anyindication of life abroad the disc.Intelligently Controlled""No, but it was intelligently controlled, that\'s certain. Benton looked athim closely. ""That size, it would hardly be remote-controlled, would it?""""I couldn\'t say,"" replied the Air Force man. Nor would he tell what theGander Airport radar had shown about the disc\'s speed and maneuvers.""What\'s behind all this?"" demanded Mooney. ""Up to now, I believed theAir Force. You people say there aren\'t any flying saucer...""""Sorry, I can\'t answer any questions,"" said the captain. ""Why not? After a scare like that, we\'ve got a right to know what\'s going on."" The Intelligence officer shook his head. ""I can\'t answer any questions,"" he repeated.As quickly as possible, intelligence reports with full details were flashedto the four Defense commanders already notified, with an extra message forthe Director of Naval Intelligence. After the Constellation reachedPatuxent, the air crews were interviewed [debriefed] again, by Navy order.Each man made a written report, with his opinion of what he had seen.Five days later, Commander Benton had a phone call from a scientist in ahigh government agency. ""I\'m informed you had a close-up UFO sighting.I\'d like to see you.""Benton checked, found the man was cleared by the Navy. Next day, thescientist appeared, showed his credential, listened intently to Benton\'sreport. Then he unlocked a dispatch case and took out some photographs.""Was it like any of these?"" At the third picture, Benton stopped him.""That\'s it!"" He looked sharply at the scientist. ""Somebody must knowthe answers, if you\'ve got photographs of the things."" The other mantook the pictures. ""I\'m sorry, Commander."" He closed his dispatchcase and left.At the time when I (Donald Keyhoe) learned of this case, I had servedfor two years as Director of the National Investigations Committee onAerial Phenomena.source:Flying Saucer Review, Volume 49/2, Summer 2004, pp. 21-23From the NICAP records, by Major Donald E.

A large part of this program was a reconstruction video of the events by the National Institute of Discovery Science (NISD). This program was shown twice on Discovery, 11/30/00 and 12/2/00. The reconstruction was based on the following criteria.1) A survey crew was hired to take physical measurements of all locations from the different eyewitnesses. In this way an exact series of measurements regarding the location, direction, and distance of the flying object from the observers was possible. 2)A professional interviewer was hired who conducted face-to-face interviews with each witness at all locations. Photographs were taken of each location. 3)A 40 watt Argon laser with steering optics was used at each location with the help of each eyewitness to take the exact flight path of the object as determined from the perspective of each eyewitness. The eyewitnesses each determined the specific placement of the laser beams. 4)The reconstructed testimony was used to construct a series of 3D aerial grids for each location. Then a 3D CAD package was used to create a rough model of the object as seen by the different eyewitnesses. A second animation modeling software package was used to fine-tune the details. Each eyewitness was consulted on a regular basis to verify the accuracy of the computer modeling process. With multiple iterations, the modeling tools fine-tuned the recreation into a final animation. The computer-generated models were then merged with live footage so that the exact scale, size, and flight path of the object was precisely reconstructed to the satisfaction of each eyewitness. ', ""Stinson Lake UFO Photo, 2000February 2000 - Strangely Shaped UFO Photographed   Stinson Lake, proximate to a U.S. army training area, may be an alien or government UFO base, or a focus of investigation or travel by aliens, one reason being possible mining as the area is rich in precious minerals. A mirror ship was photographed directing a beam of light at the hillside. Two questions that come to mind are: What was it? And why was it at an army operations area?   I was given a photograph last night of an object above the snow covered evergreens in the soupy late afternoon February sky of 2000 at Stinson Lake. It is not a painted object such as blue underneath and white on top, or black, or part metal and paint...   It is like a mirror reflecting the milky white sky above and the forest below color for color, tone for tone, hue for hue with intensity above surrounding fields at nearest equator and diminishing below surrounding fields (slightly faded at outer or left and right edges) undeniably displaying a round or roundish shape.   There are no wings and no engines noise according to the photographer. There is a shadow outlining its shape in a clearing below it and the same shadow is on the underside reflection. There's more.   After closely examining the object utilizing digital enhancement techniques, globes are seen underneath with hints of green and white lights, a possible dome on top which almost completely blends in with the sky and globular energy field where there are color shifts in the pixel spectrum where there are no added colors but a reorganization of existing colors suggesting a mirage effect also seen with the Mexico videos. The shifted field forms a perfect globe around the object exactly touching is outer edge no matter the attitude of the craft.   Sitting back a little from a 600% enlargement on the monitor screen, a field 'net' effect is obvious. The field appears webbed like a fish net formed into a globe and transparent white. Further, there is evidence of a beam of light pointing at a dark round spot also in a clearing on a nearby hill.   Above the object is a mushroom-shape distortion similar to the globular energy field but larger, which raises the question of the portal of origin or a second ship. It was so sudden, the photographer never had any indication of what was about to transpire as he shot landscape photographs in the otherwise peaceful environs around him.   The photographer happened to be at the site near where the U.S. Army has historically conducted paratrooper and other training. The Army's conventional presence may well have been replaced by something extremely advanced. But the sightings have not diminished in that remote and tranquil location unlikely to be stumbled upon by any tourist.

The residents said yesterday they saw the shining object land at 3am.   ""The lights from the object came in intervals, similar to lightning, but there was no sign of rain,"" Mohamad Mat Diah, 51, said.   ""The light from the object was very bright and the rays bathed the inside of my house.   ""I suspected something was happening outside and looked out and saw the object hovering over the marshland for several minutes,"" he added.   Mohamad said at daybreak he went over to the area some 100m from his house and saw a \'Y\' shaped depression measuring 15m by 5m which could have been caused by the unidentified flying object (UFO).   Near the depression was another crescent shaped 3m deep hollow and three holes, one metre apart and each one metre in diameter, he said.   ""I was accompanied to the area by two others who initially were afraid to come with me,"" he said.   Another resident Saupi Salleh, 28, said he was awakened by the bright light.   ""I clearly saw the light from the object,"" he said.   ""I thought it was lightning but when it prevailed I realised it was something else.""

1878, ,"[' January 1878, Denison, Texas Daylight UFO The term ""flying saucer"" was made popular by a journalist covering Kenneth Arnolds\'s sighting of nine flying disks in June of 1947. The journalist misquoted Arnold, who did not describe the objects as saucer shaped, but describes their strange movement as similar to a saucer thrown on water and bouncing several times: they ""flew like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water."" But a Texan farmer, John Martin, used the term ""saucer"" 69 years earlier to describe the flying object he saw on a hunting expedition in the surroundings of Denison, Texas, on January 2, 1878. In this case also, ""saucer"" does not refer to the shape, but to the size of the observed object, as its shape was described as that of a balloon. John Martin saw the dark object high in the Southern sky. He first noticed it to be about the size of an orange, that grew in size as it got closer to him. After he had to rest his eyes, it had increased considerably in size and appeared to be going quite fast. When it was over him it was the size of a large saucer and at a great height. Because this UFO was dark, and not a mysterious light, reflective, or silvery, many scientists believe he saw a solid object against the sky, with the light behind it. The sighting was reported by the local newspaper Denison Daily News on January 25, 1878, with the title ""A Strange Phenomenon."" The article was a first-hand report from the farmer, and its full text is: ""From Mr. John Martin, a farmer who lives some six miles south of this city, we learn the following strange story: Tuesday morning while out hunting, his attention was directed to a dark object high up in the southern sky. The peculiar shape and velocity with which the object seemed to approach riveted his attention and he strained his eves to discover its character.""""When first noticed, it appeared to be about the size of an orange, which continued to grow in size. After gazing at it for some time Mr. Martin became blind from long looking and left off viewing it for a time in order to rest his eyes. On resuming his view, the object was almost overhead and had increased considerably in size, and appeared to be going through space at wonderful speed.""""When directly over him it was about the size of a large saucer and was evidently at great height. Mr. Martin thought it resembled, as well as he could judge, a balloon. It went as rapidly as it had come and was soon lost to sight in the heavenly skies. Mr. Martin is a gentleman of undoubted veracity and this strange occurrence, if it was not a balloon, deserves the attention of our scientists.""Of course, old reports somehow lack in accurate information, and no witness interview is possible to get the missing information or check the witness reliability. But these old reports exist, and even lacking of clear data, they sometimes cannot be easily interpreted in terms of commonplace phenomenon. Who knows? Maybe some even older report can still surface, where a UFO is described as ""saucer"" - like in some aspect. written by B J BoothREFERENCES:""A Strange Phenomenon"", article in newspaper Denison Daily News, January 25, 1878.

1984, ,"['1984 - Italy -The Isidoro Ferri EncounterPublished: 3:56 PM 2/2/2007October 9, 1984, Polcanto, Firenze, ItalyOn October 9, or 29, 1984, at 03:30 AM, Isidoro Ferri, a doorman at the Villa la Radicchia, in Polcanto, close to Florence, Italy, was normally sleeping with his son and other relatives in his bedroom when he was awakened by a strong light on his face. Initially, he did not understand the origin of the light, then, in a few moments, he saw that it came from an individual of humanoid appearance at a distance of approximately 40 meters, apparently on a nearby hill, who had some sort of powerful flashlight or beacon on the head. It is not specified whether Ferri was still in bed in the house, outside, or at the window at that time. Ferri first thought it was a poacher, but suddenly he changed his mind, as the figure disappeared in a fog or in a blur, or gave place, to a dark horizontal line, under which three flames went down towards the ground. Other summaries indicate it was some sort of luminous cupola looking like ""fire"", which searched the area with beams of light, replaced suddenly after a few minutes, and an enormous blinding white light that started to approach, illuminating the entire area as in full daylight. Some sources say the witness tried to approach the window, but he remained paralyzed before he arrived there, until the light seemed sucked back. One source indicates he was paralyzed by fear. A red sphere then appeared, which had an intermittent light that hurt the witness\' eyes, and he had red and irritated eyes for several days. This glowing red sphere is said to have disappeared behind the hills in the direction of Vaglia. The dog, who slept outside, had not barked. He showed an abnormal behavior by refusing any food for several days and by staying inside its doghouse during the two next weeks, without barking after passers-by. In the surroundings, three circular holes of 10 centimeters diameter and 3 centimeters depth forming an irregular triangle of 2 meters of side approximately, were discovered, where the grass seemed to have undergone a pressure, but no radioactivity was detected. An investigation report into this case was written by Pier Luigi Sani. A newspaper recalls that the witness appeared in one TV interview with the Ministry of Defense, and policemen and other people insisted his testimony was in good faith; some source say that other people saw a red light in the sky that night. The author indicates that the most complete investigation report into this case is that of Pier Luigi Sani. ', ' Incident at Indian Point Reactor Complex, N. Y. 1984                The threat of UFOs compromising reactor security, asif the nuclear industry didn\'t have enough to deal withalready, became a very real concern in 1984. Although of-ficials won\'t admit it, several researchers have information ThatNew York\'s Indian Point Reactor complex endured sucha UFO problem during the long siege of sightings thathappened throughout the state\'s Hudson Valley area.The portrayal of the event in this article is based primarily onthe disclosures of unnamed sources.   The summer of 1984 was a troublesome season forauthorities at the Indian Point nuclear reactor complex inBuchanan, New York. Two UFO appearances, one of which was verifiedby Carl Patrick, director of nuclear information for the New YorkPower Authority (NYPA), and later documented by the press and the1987 book Night Siege, apparently put the normally tight securityof the plant to a severe test. The first event entailed the briefflyover of a huge craft, witnessed by three security policemen onJune 14. That was followed ten days later by a UFO incident ofunprecedented impact. It was one of hundreds of UFO sightings inthe Hudson Valley, but one the nuclear workers won\'t soon forget.   ""Here comes that UFO again!"" an Indian Point security guard issaid to have yelled on the night of July 24, 1984, alerting othersecurity personnel by way of the plant\'s internalcommunications system. A UFO, variously described as looking like ""an ice cream cone"" and ""boomerang,"" had lazily drifted overto Reactor #3-the only active reactor at the time-lingering about300 feet above the domed construction for some ten minutes, sendingsecurity officials into an uproar. Now, six years later, theprincipal UFO researcher on the case admits that many aspects ofthe event remain confusing and undisclosed. And although he\'s stillreceiving information, Philip Imbrogno calls his own lengthyinvestigation ""stagnant.""    ""Every time new information comes up or I get a lead onsomething, I get very reluctant to deal with it again,"" saidImbrogno, who heads the science department at the Windward Schoolin White Plains, New York. ""The entire case has caused me quite abit of pressure . . . The event would indicate that whateverappeared over there, our state-of-the-art technology in defense wasunable to deal with it."" He suggests that from what his sourceshave said, a military aspect came into play. The Indian Point UFOrepresented an intolerable security breach.Military customers?   Imbrogno says that it is precisely that aspect which has had alasting effect, and which has generated repercussions that continueto this day. But according to the New York Power Authority, whichoversees the reactor complex, Indian Point itself has no directmilitary customers. Reactor #3 primarily services local and statefacilities in New York City and Westchester County, including localschool districts, the New York City subway systems and some of NewYork\'s trains. Most importantly, in Imbrogno\'s mind, are severalmilitary installations in and around Duchess County, whichallegedly get their power from Indian Point. According to hissources, these are primarily satellite receiving stations, and ""anumber of other military operations of which we can only guess,""Imbrogno says. The official agency overseeing the reactor complexis the New York Power Authority, although Consolidated Edison hasjurisdiction over Reactor #2 and is sold use of #3 for extensivetransmissions to New York residential users and, perhaps, militaryfacilities such as Camp Smith, an Air National Guard base locatednorth of Peekskill. (Reactor #l is inactive.)  It was NYPA whose officials apparently spent considerable humanenergy trying to dissuade Imbrogno from writing about the July 24event, concerned he would release information vital to the plant\'ssecurity. ""I think other agencies were using (the NYPA) to harassme,"" he said, noting that he was constantly subjected to theirrepetitive phone calls, threatening that he would be forced toappear at a hearing on the incident. (He was never subpoenaed, butImbrogno subsequently, and perhaps coincidentally, was audited bythe IRS four times.)The compulsion to publish was undeniable; of what may have beenas many as 70 UFO witnesses among Indian Point personnel, a numberquietly sought out Imbrogno, and on the condition of anonymityprovided him with the vital facts which led to the production ofNight Siege (co-written with Bob Pratt and J. Allen Hynek.)""Mysources involve people who work in security for the plant and alsopeople in secretarial and janitorial positions,"" he said.                                 ""The only problem is that getting anything on paper-documentation, something official-is very, very hard, I haveunofficial confirmation right now that a number of documentspertaining to the sighting do exist at the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission."" Normally, NRC records can be opened to the publicunder terms of the Freedom of Information Act, but when he in-quired, Imbrogno was informed that the documents were being held atthe reactor complex, and as such were protected under nationalsecurity regulations. ""It\'s a joint sort of thing,"" he said, ""Inother words, although the NRC is pretty open to the public, if they want to keep a document classified, they\'ll store it with anotheragency. I have an inside secretarial source who\'s actually seen thedocuments filed.""The NYPA\'s Patrick denies that any such documentation exists, and dismisses the incident by claiming thatall Hudson Valley UFO sightings were later identified as lightaircraft. There was no videotape taken by on-site surveillancecameras, Patrick insists, or audio recording of oral communications, both pieces of evidence which Imbrogno stronglyfeels do exist and are being retained somewhere. According toImbrogno\'s sources, a security shake-up ensued the very next day.""A number of agencies came in, including the NRC and militarypersonnel, and they supposedly cleaned out everything. You have toremember that with nuclear reactors, you\'re only going to get 10percent of the real story. They\'re overly terrified of badpublicity, and are really afraid of the anti-nuclear groups, whichcan cause trouble. Anything that happens is immediately covered up,including UFO sightings.""An \'irregularity\'  Imbrogno further alleges that shortly after the UFO infringement,a crack in the reactor\'s casing was discovered. The public didn\'thear about such a situation until a year later; the NYPA\'s Patrickdenied any ""crack,"" although he did recall a time when Reactor #2may have developed an ""irregularity."" Imbrogno says, ""[IndianPoint officials] made a public statement that operations were notaffected, that everything was normal. But I\'ve been told by severalpeople that they lost power, the security system dropped, and thereactor controls went crazy. Apparently it was caused by the UFO.""No way, says the NYPA.  ""Any implication that the sightings ofthese [light aircraft] in any way affected Reactor #3 is false"",Patrick said. Imbrogno\'s sources indicate otherwise. Supposedly, amass of sophisticated, high-accuracy tracking equipment wasinstalled at the complex, enabling security to quickly generate acomputer image of whatever aircraft might be affecting theequipment. Apparently such problems are still going on. Patrickwould not comment on what kinds of security equipment protectIndian Point, but stressed that nothing new has been installedsince the incident.  Imbrogno is also suspicious that the armed security forces at thesite may have had reason to attempt firing on the craft, again anallegation flatly refuted by the NYPA. ""I know a number ofhelicopters with rocket launchers were sent up and followed thecraft for some distance,"" Imbrogno commented, citing his anonymoussources for the info. ""When these helicopters went on their way,the object moved off and started crossing the Hudson, anddisappeared up north.""  Officials will not talk to Imbrogno, nor answer his letters, hesays. UFO spoke with Cliff Spieler, vice president at the New YorkPower Authority. He, like Patrick, basically dismisses the entireaffair. ""Having looked into this thing and living two miles fromIndian Point, think the UFO reports are nonsense,"" he said. ""AllHudson Valley UFO sightings] are linked to small planes flying outof Duchess County.""    At one time, officials speaking for Indian Point made theirposition quite clear to Imbrogno, ""They said, \'you can cooperatewith us, or you don\'t have to cooperate with us. If you don\'tcooperate with us, you have to face the consequences, because youare dealing in an area of national security. The incident that tookplace over there involved national security because it was a breachof security at a nuclear reactor.\' But they weren\'t ready to saywho was breaching security!"" In considering the ""who,"" Imbrognotook in a number of hypotheses, including the possibility that theincident was an elaborate test flight of a secret military craft,such as the B-2 Stealth bomber, or a covertly-planned contingencytest of the plant\'s security operations, carried out under theguise of a UFO overflight.  Nothing is impossible, he\'ll admit. But the most tenable answer,he feels, is that the UFO was an extraterrestrial craft. ""I don\'tthink our government could be so bold with a craft of the kind thatappeared at Indian Point,"" he said.  ""Talking to these securitypeople, and looking into their eyes,"" his voice trailed,"" . . . they tell a story of this one cop who got up on the roof belowthe UFO, and the thing started moving a little bit. He pulled outhis gun, looked at it, then put the gun back in his holster andducked! The people who were telling these stories are notfamiliar with the UFO literature. If I really wanted to go intothis, with no fear of what would happen to me, I\'m sure there\'s anincredible story here. I am still being giveninformation about certain things going on there-In the nighttime,people seeing little creatures coming through the walls of thecasing on the reactor, and military personnel indicating \'we\'reaware of these creatures and we don\'t care if they\'re from outerspace-shoot \'em!\' On a newscast on Channel 7 in New York,they were interviewing one guy, and he said, \'I saw it going overthe reactor! I think they\'re sucking the power from it! That\'s whatthey\'re doing!\' But a civilization that has this type of vehicle-any intelligence, whatever it is-I\'m sure doesn\'t need nuclearenergy."" Editor\'s Note: In a letter to UFO shortly after this article waswritten, Imbrogno added to his remarks.  ""It is hard to believethat people like John Lear and Bill Cooper are revealing \'topsecret\' information with little or no repercussions. I just pokedmy nose a little too deep into an area of national security and gotmy ears pinned back for it. My next step is to approach this in alegal way by asking for an investigation (preferably by a member ofCongress) to find out how and why the security at thisgovernment reactor was violated and why information is beingwithheld.""source:This file was provided to the ParaNet Information Service byUFO Magazine.

1989, ,"['Conclusions1989 Brecon Beacons UFO Sighting ReportBy Dave HodrienSighting DetailsBack in November 1989, my girlfriend Katie Francis, and her great aunt Janice had a stunning close encounter with a UFO while crossing the Brecon Beacons. It is something that even after all these years they remember quite vividly. After interviewing them both about the incident I can now reveal to you what occurred.At the time of the sighting, Katie was eleven years old and her brother Tim was five. They had been on holiday visiting Janice at Leamington Spa. She was driving them home to Neath in South West Wales. Their journey took them across the Brecon Beacons moor. It was early evening and quite dark in the sky, but the moorland was still partially visible. The weather was clear and there was very little cloud. The road was deserted and there were no other cars on it. Katie was sitting on the back seat next to her brother and staring out of the back window of the car.She noticed in the sky an object with a row of coloured lights along it. The object was quite far away and high up. There were too many lights along it to be a normal aircraft. They were flashing and changing colours, mostly white and red, but some other colours too.The object was moving slowly across the sky. Katie alerted her great aunt to the object, and she also glanced back at it. The object seemed to keep changing position in the sky. It was there one minute, gone the next, and it kept reappearing in different places in relation to the moving car. Janice was trying to scare Katie and Tim about the object, saying it was going to come and get them.Suddenly, the object appeared much closer to the car and much lower in the sky, Katie estimates under 100 foot up.  Both Katie and Janice could now clearly see that the lights were in a curved line as if along the edge of a large disc shaped object, however the main body of the object could not be seen.Katie estimates that it was at least twice as big as a house. It was behind and to the right of the car hovering in the sky. At this point Janice decided to stop to get a photograph of the object as she was very interested in what it could be. She pulled up at the side of the road and got out. She went round to the back of the car and opened the boot to get her camera. The object appeared to now be stationary and it was completely silent. Katie started to panic at this point and was screaming at Janice to get back in the car. Janice was also a little unnerved by the object, but mostly fascinated by it. She got the camera out but couldn’t work out how to use the night setting on it. Because of this, and the fact that Katie was very frightened, she decided to get back in the car and continue driving. After this. neither witness looked back to see if the object was still following them so it was not seen again.Janice also informed me of something else unusual which occurred. Shortly after they continued on their journey, there was suddenly a huge glow of bluish-white light that lit up the hills in front of the car. The glow lasted for up to ten seconds before dying away. Janice felt it was linked to the object which they had seen but because Katie was frightened she did not tell her about it.A Related Sighting?In June 2008, Dr Simon Griffey saw mysterious lights over the Brecon Beacons. His reported sighting has numerous similarities with what Katie and Janice witnessed. Below is the article that appeared in The Sun on 27th June 08 including a photograph:The Green Green Men Of HomeBy JOHN COLES A baffled university don who spotted a UFO over the Brecon Beacons last night said: “There is no logical explanation.” Dr Simon Griffey saw lights loom over a mountain village – before they disappeared. His close encounter is the third reported in the space of just five days, following sightings by the Army and police. Simon, a doctor of psychology at Cardiff University, said: “I’ve had loads of theories proposed by friends and neighbours but none of them add up.” Dr Griffey, 50, and his son Jack, 23, were driving near Llangynidr Mountain in the Brecon Beacons, Powys, when they spotted lights over Talybont-on-Usk. He said: “There was no noise whatsoever, it was a bit eerie. I’ve driven over this mountain for 17 years and have never seen anything like it. There were seven lights and having read the description from the soldiers in Shropshire, there are some similarities. They were the same sort of colour and the same spherical shape that they reported. I know I wasn’t seeing things because Jack saw exactly the same as I did – and two other cars pulled over to look.” Sceptics have suggested the sightings could be huge man-made lanterns floating into the sky. But the boffin, of Llangynidr, said: “It was too big. It was way above the horizon and stayed there for 15 minutes. It was a bit smaller than a full moon – quite big and high up.” Jack recorded the phenomenon on his mobile phone – but when they examined the pictures later, they found only three of the seven lights showed up.ConclusionsTo this day, both witnesses are convinced that the object they saw was definitely not a conventional aircraft or helicopter of any kind. The arrangement and number of lights on the object, and the way that they were changing colours seem to suggest something very unusual. Janice and Katie both mentioned independently that the object was very large and disc-shaped even though the main body of it could not be made out. Also the object was completely silent even when it approached, and it seemed to be able to move or hover still in the air at will. The area of the Brecon Beacons is used for military training and often jets are flown over it. Could the object have been a secret advanced aircraft of some kind? This is a possibility, but if this were the case then why did it appear to be following the witness’s car as if interested in it? Surely the pilots would have wanted to keep such a craft away from the eyes of the public? The glowing light that lit up the hillside shortly after the sighting of the UFO is also very interesting. The only natural thing which could possibly account for such a sight would be sheet lightning. However Janice said that it stayed visible far too long for it to have been this. Also the weather was clear and it only occured once so it seems very unlikely that this would have been the cause. In all the years since the years since the incident, Janice has never seen anything else like it, even though she has driven over the Brecon Beacons many times.Thanks to Craig at www.bufog.com for sending along the article.', 'NAVIGATION1989 Brecon Beacons UFO Sighting ReportBy Dave HodrienSighting DetailsBack in November 1989, my girlfriend Katie Francis, and her great aunt Janice had a stunning close encounter with a UFO while crossing the Brecon Beacons.

The area of the Brecon Beacons is used for military training and often jets are flown over it. Could the object have been a secret advanced aircraft of some kind? This is a possibility, but if this were the case then why did it appear to be following the witness’s car as if interested in it? Surely the pilots would have wanted to keep such a craft away from the eyes of the public? The glowing light that lit up the hillside shortly after the sighting of the UFO is also very interesting. The only natural thing which could possibly account for such a sight would be sheet lightning. However Janice said that it stayed visible far too long for it to have been this. Also the weather was clear and it only occured once so it seems very unlikely that this would have been the cause. In all the years since the years since the incident, Janice has never seen anything else like it, even though she has driven over the Brecon Beacons many times.Thanks to Craig at www.bufog.com for sending along the article.', ""The 1989 Nashville, Tennessee PhotographsInside the outer perimeter lights are panels of lights. These also appear to have the ability to change color. Although they are predominantly white they are sometimes seen as partially red or black. Assuming the craft is 100 feet in diameter these outer panels take up about 40 feet or 20 feet on each side. Below the center of craft there appears to be a crystal or lights with crystal like appearance. Generally these lights appear blue. craft appears to rotate in the photos. Graham gave me his word that these were authentic photographs of an actual flying craft to the best knowledge. He has known the photographer for 24 years and the man worked for him for ten years. He has always been know to tell the truth and was of high character.Editor's Note: I have observed a UFO at close distance. The colors of the smoke probably are a coronal discharge similar to what I saw. The lights themselves have an unusual depth of color. When you look at a coloredlight it is normally a white light covered by a lens of red, yellow, green, blue etc. The lights on the craft appear as if the light contain the actual color. There is a vividness of color that is difficult to describe that appears to be in these photos. The fog or plasma is penetrated by the powerful lights shining downward. The lights extend down for an estimated seventy-five feet to one hundred plusfeet and seem to stop abruptly. Duplication of this capability is exceptionally difficult to accomplish with any normal lights. I have never seen lights that have these properties except on a UFO, nor have I seen comparable photography. I have over 5000 hours flying time and taken thousands of photographs. I would be very interested in any similar photographs or videos of a comparable craft.source:http://www.nationalufocenter.com/features/bethune.htm"", 'Large V-Shaped UFO Encounter with US Navy Nuclear SubmarineOctober 24, 1989 - A sailor reports about the UFO sighting he had while in the Navy. ""I was assigned to USS Memphis (SSN-698), Homeport - Titusville, FL. (Cape Canaveral.)Our mission was Special Assignments which meant we protected the Space Program. We would go to sea and patrol while the shuttle was on the pad.On October 24 and 25, 1989, my ship was on patrol about 150 miles of the Florida coast. We were cruising at about 500 feet when the submarine started experiencing electronics problems.The ship was malfunctioning, our tanks were blowing out of control, we were losing navigation ability and the communications area was totally lost.We went to all stop and tried to access what was happening. The controls in the reactor area started to malfunction. This presented a serious danger to our safety, so the captain ordered us to shut down the reactor, surface and go to diesel motors.When the ship surfaced I went to my watch station. The ship was still experiencing electronic difficulties but the mechanical devices such as diesel engines, cook stoves, and turbines were fine.It was raining and the entire sky was red like a red neon sign.I saw a large inverted V-shaped UFO off the port side. The executive officer told me to stand fast and he would speak to the captain. In a minute, the captain appeared on the tower and asked me for a distance to the craft.The laser range finder determined the closest point was 200 meters, and the farthest point was 1,000 meters off the port. The UFO was not perpendicular to our ship but at about a 45\' angle.This huge vessel was over a half mile across. The UFO made a half circle around our ship then passed across the stern causing our electronics systems to go crazy.We had permanent damage in communications and the sonar room. As the craft flew over the stern, I could see the rain stop under its red glow.The water seemed to rise almost a foot as the UFO passed over silently. When the UFO finished its swing across the stern it paused - the sky got brighter red and it simply moved off at tremendous speed inside 15 seconds.When the UFO left, our boat returned to normal with the exception of the radio and sonar. We did a quick system check and the captain ordered us to return to reactor power and get underway.The captain took two petty officers, the executive officer, and myself into the wardroom. He told us to not spread any rumors until we had a chance to talk to Commander Submarine Fleet - Atlantic.We reached port in about 7 hours where I was taken into ""protective custody.""Two enlisted men and myself agreed we had witnessed a real UFO. I was the one who shot it with a laser range finder, so I was the only one that had its exact sizes. I shot that vessel as it hovered and I got solid readings, not spotty like I would on debris.We were in holding for about three hours when an officer from the Air Force arrived and gave us a line of bull about an exploding weather satellite.The Navy then transferred virtually everyone on the crew to new assignments.This included the captain, the executive officer and the entire crew. They were split up which almost never happens unless one of them gets a promotion or a new command, neither of which happened.The military just split up a 4 year team. I was watching a program tonight that gave me the courage to share it.', '1989-The Battle of the Flying SaucersWell known Russian UFO investigator Nikolay Subbotin relates an amazing story of a battle of flying saucers. This incident  allegedly took place in the skies of Zaostrovka, in Russia in 1989. On September 16, six circular, silver, flying saucers ganged up and fought a seventh, golden saucer, in full view of the residents of the town and surrounding areas. Hundreds of witnesses watched the gang of six chase the golden saucer out of a cloud bank. All of the saucers made unbelievable maneuvers during this dog fight, and at times, the UFOs flew as low as 5,000 feet. The weapon of choice was a strong beam of light or energy fired at and from the escaping golden UFO.According to the RUFORS Internet newsletter, an account of this event was  published in the local newspaper, ""Semipalatinsk."" According to this report, written by a Russian helicopter commander in the Afghan war, the energy emitted during this battle shut down the local power grid in Zaostrovka, plunging the city into total darkness for a time. The author, named Sichenko, interviewed witnesses of the event, publishing many of their fantastic accounts of the events that day.The witnesses claimed that the outnumbered golden UFO finally was defeated, losing altitude due to the continued hits by the energy beams. The failing saucer at first seemed to be attempting to make a controlled landing, but eventually it lost control, disappearing from view behind a house as it plunged to the ground. The six assaulting saucers soon disappeared from view, heading into the clouds.Subbotin discovered that the lost saucer had crashed into a bog on a military test range. This area was ""off limits"" to the general public. It would be about a year before he and accompanying researchers could reach the site of the crash, but by that time, the area was clean, free of any trace of a crashed vehicle. Subbotin would learn that a military team had descended on the boggy area, and conducted a full search and rescue operation. There were reported injuries during this operation. Russian Ufologist Emil Bachurin was able to see medical files which confirmed details of injuries to military personnel involved in the mission.It would be reported that several members of the search and rescue team had leaked information about the operation,  but their breach of confidence was discovered, and security was made even tighter. Also, an airplane attempting to fly over the area and gather details about the crash had to abort its mission because of instrument malfunction.Eventually, all activities at the military range were shut down, and the base put under heavy guard. This case is very  similar to another Russian case, the Shaitan Mazar Crash, which also involved Subbotin and Bachurin.If the event of 1989 is true, there is a downed flying saucer in the possession of the Russian military, or possibly being guarded by the military in its own icy grave in the city of Zaostrovka.

Just maybe, WE ARE NOTALONE!', 'Alleged UFO Crash in Russia 1989At approximately 11:00 AM on August 10, 1989 near the city of Prohladnyi, Russia, Soviet military radar units detected an unidentified flying object. After attempts to communicate went unanswered, the object was noted as ""hostile.""Defense systems were put on alert, with utilization of surface to air missiles, and the deployment of Mig-25s. Blasting out of Rostov and Krymsk, the Migs were ordered to intercept and identify the unknown object.The UFO was on a north heading, like foreign missiles or planes would be, and the order was given to arm and use weapons. A ground to air missile hit the UFO, causing it to ditch over the Caucasian Mountains.A retrieval team on board an M1-8 helicopter was sent, and the disc-shaped object was located outside of Nizhnizy Chegem, and the area around the crash site was soon cordoned off. The object was 6.9 meters long and 3.0 meters high, shaped like a cockleshell, according to witnesses.A long rut in the earth could be seen leading to the craft, which had smashed into an area of rocks. The damage from the missile was obvious, causing the object to lose its original shape. A team with special protective equipment moved into the scene. Dosimeters detected radiation, and precautionary measures were immediately taken, but not before some team members had been exposed.The object was delivered by helicopter to Mozdok Air Base, where nuclear weapons and long range bombers were housed. A special investigative team was assembled, and sent to the base to begin an investigation into the mysteries of the unknown flying object. This team consisted of military and civilian personnel. The KGB began a cover-up operation.The craft research team gained entry into the craft via a partially opened door. The team was in full protective gear as they began their investigation of the inside of the craft. As one would expect, control panels and equipment was visible, but more importantly three alien creatures, two dead were found. The two dead aliens had apparently been killed by falling equipment, but the third managed to save itself, but was suffering from several wounds.A medical team attempted to keep the alien alive, but their efforts failed. He and his two companions were about 1.0-1.2 meters tall, with whitish gray skin that appeared to be outer cover. The real skin beneath this cover was a blue-green color with a reptilian texture. The other worldly beings also had hairless heads, large black eyes,  almost round, which were covered by a protective lid. Three web fingers were at the end of their long, slender arms. The three dead aliens were preserved in glass containers in a top-secret underground facility. This secret location is allegedly hidden among the multitude of trees near the research center east of Solnechnogorsk. The damaged disc was taken to the Kapustin Yar range and placed under ground west of Ahryomkin. All of the information included here originated from three Russian investigators; Anton Anfalov, Lenura Azizova and Alexander Mosolov. They claim that the disc is still housed near Kapustin Yar.source and references:written by B J Booth, based on information from Anton Anfalov, Lenura Azizova and Alexander Mosolov.', 'Sullivan County Tennessee UFO Sighting, 1989Sullivan County, TN, July 1989I interviewed two witnesses today. One, an elderly woman and the other, her son. These witnesses related to me a sighting which took place in the summer, July of 1989.The two witnesses were sitting under the edge of their carport enjoying the pleasant night and it was about midnight.One witness (the son) noted a very large and burning object moving straight at them and very low on the horizon. Both witnesses began watching as the object passed slowly overhead. Separately, they described the object as being almost wing like and slightly swept back on its extreme ends.  Shape was described as alar, with an aspect of 8 X 1, (8 being width) The object was seen to be burning intensely and ""dripping fire"", much like burning plastic. They described that as the object passed overhead, the fire was dripping straight down and not trailing behind it as it moved and that it was of a relative size equal to their arms spread wide, exceptionally large. The object passed them and moved off to the southeast continuing to drip fire and passed Holston mountain in the distance. The moment it was out of view, a deep intense rumble was heard from the direction of the object. The object was noted to have been moving very slowly, the duration of the sighting agreed to by both witnesses, having lasted at least one minute, possibly more.The primary witness called the FAA office at tri-city airport and was told that nothing was/had been present on radar. He also called the local Sheriff office where he was told that many calls had came in and that they did not know what it was.Having checked cataloged sightings for that approximate date, we can arrive at no conclusions except that it must have been a fantastic sighting.

1970, ,"[' CASEBOOK HOME PAGEIn the very late 1970s, Puerto Rican UFO investigator Jorge Martin came forward with details of an amazing account of the discovery of an Alien corpse. Martin was regarded with high esteem by the UFO community, and his story was subsequently published by Michael Hesemann in Magazin 2000, No. 109, February, 1996. Martin fought hard to unravel the maze of information and disinformation surrounding the events on the island. He spent two years on this case of a lifetime for a UFO investigator.The haunting details of Martin\'s story took place in a mysterious area of Puerto Rico called ""Tetas de Cayey,"" or Twin Mountain Peaks. Two young boys were havinga youthful adventure during a night time fishing trip, during which they investigated aseries of caves in the area.  Jose Chino Zaya and his friend were suddenly frightenedto death by the appearance of several small beings who were making one of the caves their temporary home.According to Zaya, one of the small creatures grabbed him by the leg. He quickly picked up a stick and hammered the creature over the head, killing him. Having an elementary knowledge of science, Zaya took the being home, preserving it in formaldehyde. A few days later, he felt compelled to report the incident to the localPolice Department in Las Ochentas, near Salinas.Officer Osvaldo Santiago was assigned to the case. He visited Jose, and examined the strange, unearthly looking being. Jose was beginning to have second thoughts about his decision to bring the dead being home with him, and requested that Santiago take the body with him. Jose admitted that hewas afraid that the other beings would come looking for their dead companion. Santiago could not keep the details from his wife, who in turn, related the strangeevents to a well-known businessman of the area, who requests anonymity. Thisunnamed businessman immediately came to see the alien, and took a number ofphotographs, some of which are show here.The business man soon contacted Professor Calixto Peres, a chemist on thestaff of the University of Puerto Rico for his expert opinion. After a thorough examination of thebeing, he made this statement:""In my opinion it is something extraterrestrial. Its cranium is far too big for the body, which is small and skinny, and itseyes were too big.""Measurements taken of the being showed a length of slightly over 12 inches.Its body was extremely thin, and its skull was almost destroyed from the blow on the head. There is only speculation as where the body is today, andthe mystery of the Puerto Rican being is ongoing until more facts can befound.', ""Strange Craft Appears then Disappears into Thin Air at Springhill Ranch, Late 1970sSpringhill Ranch-Date: Late 70s-Time: afternoon (summer or fall)Location: Springhill Ranch, Telkwa Hi-road, Smithers BC CanadaIt took me many years to try to remember exactly how the craft looked like. I couldn't remember which set of wings were where until I attempted to recreate what I saw that day. For a while I thought the smaller set was in the front. But this looks more like it.Thanks to my good friend Barb for sending me this article.B J I was in the back area of the property looking for my horse to go riding that day. Normally my horse along with the others would have been there but for some reason they were spooked and up in the woods on the hillside. I never clued in that something might be wrong.I was on my way back along the fence towards the house when I just stopped in my tracks. I had this feeling that I should look up and that's when I saw that craft above my head. The air was still. I never heard a sound coming from it. It was just in the air and was not moving. I don't know how long it was up there before I noticed it but after about 30 seconds it just took off into thin air. I had a clear shot of the whole sky in the valley and I tell you it just vanished within a couple of seconds - without a sound.The following is the outlay of the ranch where the encounter occurred. Most of our property was located on a hillside (to the left) which cannot be seen on the following diagram.For days afterwards I drew a stick diagram of the body and how the wings were. I knew there was something odd about those wings facing the wrong way. I never associated it to a UFO for many many years because UFOs were suppose to be flying saucers, or at least that's what I was lead to believe. The first thing I thought, after my mind went blank staring at that thing in awe, was that it was military. Perhaps because it was black, who knows. But it wasn't right and was completely out of place. Not to mention hovering over my head.I also began drawing a strange diagram. I spent days working at it to get it right. The teardrops had to be very very dark with a slight shine to it. The original was very elaborate but I lost it over the years while moving around so much. Today I just attempted to recreate how it generally looked.The whole time a word kept popping into my head as I was working on it. Satus. I just felt it had something to do with this diagram and so I wrote the word with it. I felt so strongly that this diagram was important and that it had meaning. Who knows.It wasn't long after my encounter with the craft that I ended up back in that end of the property again. This time to bury my cat who had suddenly just up and died for no reason. I remember he had blood coming out of his nose. I loved him so much I wanted to bury him near a tree which had a hollow in it. I loved that spot for some reason. Felt special to me. The horses were back there eating grass and hanging out like they do. I laid my cat down in a deep hole I dug and then covered him up. I knew if I didn't protect him the coyotes would get to him so I went to search for some big rocks to cover his burial spot. I found a couple went and laid them near the burial and then went in search of some more. I remember feeling like I was being followed so I stopped and turned around. A young filly was the closest to me, however she was eating grass and looking away so I figured I was imagining things so I continued searching for big rocks. Again I felt like I was being followed. The young filly was even closer but she was eating and ignoring me. I turned back around and continued my search. This time I knew for sure something was behind me. I wheeled around in time to see the filly rear up. She towered over my head. That's when I realised she was going to strike me. I looked down in time otherwise she would have broken my face. Instead she struck the top of my head. I collapsed to the ground thinking she broke my neck. I screamed blue murder. I just knew she would attack me again if I didn't get out of there so I crawled to a windrow nearby.My folks heard the scream back at the house and came running. They thought I was being mauled by a bear. My face and long hair was covered with blood from the gash on top my head. To this day we do not know why the horse attacked me. Our horses were good and had never done that before. And it never happened again. The attack occurred close to where I had seen that strange craft.To this day I have not come across anyone having had a similar sighting. I'm still waiting to hear from anyone who has.source:Posted on Fri 09 Sep 2005 Barb Campbell© 2005 Northwest Saskatchewan UFO Research Center (NWSURC).

In July of 1998 an investigation led to the identification of the secondhand witness who was in possession of a slide duplicate of the image. A copy of the slide was made, a preliminary analysis performed, the witness was interviewed and results are presented in this report.  We know that there was a total of seven objects from witness testimony. This is important since object 7 (the smallest object) is almost indistinguishable from bright reflections off the mountain rocks.Sighting Description and Story Background Two couples were doing some recreational boating on Tagish Lake in 1970 (approx.). Tagish Lake is a large glacial lake about 100km(60 miles) south of Whitehorse, the Territory’s capital. The two couples were travelling in two separate boats. To respect their anonymity, we will simply refer to the two men involved in this story by their first names, Jim and George. George was in his early 50’s and Jim was in his mid 60’s around that time. Note: since the writing of this report, Jim\'s surviving daughter has been contacted. She has given her permission to disclose his identity.It was about 10 am when they were travelling southbound on the lake. It was windy and the water was a bit on the rough side. Jim\'s boat was smaller than George\'s and also had an open top. George and his wife where driving in a closed and larger boat. Because Jim had a smaller boat and wanted to stay out of the roughest water, he was travelling close to the shoreline while George and his wife could afford to travel out in the middle of the lake and were about 5 to 8 kilometres back. While travelling along the edge of the lake, Jim and his wife saw seven strange glowing orbs as shown in the photograph (Figure 1). There are four closer objects and three more further up the mountainside. Jim estimated that they were 3 to 4 feet in diameter. They moved about slowly for the estimated 15 minutes that they watched them as he and his wife traveled down the lake. The four closer objects eventually made their way up the mountain to join the other objects. George was too far back to notice the objects and didn’t even have sight of Jim\'s boat. His concentration was devoted to the rough water. Jim or his wife never mentioned anything to George until the film was developed, about a week later. We can speculate that this may have been because of the fear of ridicule or disbelief. That is until Jim had the slide in hand. As far as George knows this was the only photo of the objects that Jim took. Jim used slide film and made a couple of slide duplicates for George . George submitted one to the Weather Office who submitted it the Department of National Defence in Ottawa. About a year later George was curious to find out what the department found from their analysis so he asked the person at the Weather Office to look into it. The answer he got back was that that information was classified. Preliminary Investigation and Analysis The analysis performed here does not come from experience in analyzing UFO photographs but rather from the viewpoint of experience with photography. Further analysis is warranted by experts in the UFO field. On Sept 5, 1998 a field trip was undertaken to establish a more precise location of the sighting and the location of Jim when he took the photo. After some effort the location was found and a 1998 photograph was taken from the same spot using a camera with the same focal length lens as Jim used. The UFO locations were drawn as red circles to facilitate analysis. The island in the forefront enabled us to pinpoint the witness location on a map of the area (105K). It is estimated that the 1998 photo was taken within about 10 metres (30 ft) of the 1970 photo. Unlike the 1970 photo which was taken under cloudy conditions the 1998 photograph was taken in good lighting and therefore shows a lot more detail in the terrain. The photograph was taken at about 9:45am, about the same time of day as the 1970 photo. Because of the higher detail some further analysis could be performed. By measuring rock formations on the island and scaling them on the photograph it was established that Jim was approximately 50 metres (164 ft) from the island. The distance of 250 metres (820 ft) from the island to the shore behind it was scaled off a map. Therefore, the total distance from Jim to the shoreline was approximately 300 metres (984 ft). The 1998 photograph clearly shows that UFO#1 was in front of the tall spruce trees at the shore line. If we assume that UFO#1 is just in front of the trees and therefore 300 metres from Jim, we can calculate its size. After doing the math we get a maximum object diameter of 1.4 metres (4.5 ft). This agrees well with Jim\'s estimate that the objects were about 3 to 4 ft in diameter. Although the objects look like dots in Figure 1, calculations show that UFO#1 would of appeared to be about half the diameter of a full moon to the witnesses. These magnified images can give us the relative diameter and color of the UFOs. The diameter was used to assess object size and distance. The color of the objects also give us some important information. Note that UFOs 1 through 4 (the closest ones to the camera) are not in direct sunlight as the surrounding trees are not illuminated. Therefore, these objects may be glowing by their own source. The glow is of yellow and perhaps of a slightly green color. In contrast, the area around UFOs 5, 6, and 7 up on the mountainside is bathed in morning amber light from the sunrise. The three UFOs also seem to be of a similar amber color suggesting that they may be reflecting sunlight as well. If this is true, it indicates that they are of a solid nature rather than some form of plasma. The questions remains; if the 4 closer objects were exposed to the sunlight, would they also reflect it over and above their glowing yellow color? Did they appear to be of the same amber color to Jim once he observed the 4 closer objects join the other objects further up on the mountainside? Witness Reliability The testimony of the secondhand witness George sounded very sincere. George was curious about what Jim saw and photographed and added that neither him nor Jim have or have had a big interest in the UFO phenomenon. There was no apparent reason for Jim to make up the story or to fake the photograph. Jim’s story which was related by George sounded sincere and the two were close friends. Jim was the Chief Grain Inspector of Canada around that time and therefore it is unlikely he would have risked his credibility by perpetuating a hoax. One question which often comes up is ""Why is there only one photo of the objects when Jim observed them for 15 minutes?"" Of course there may have been more photos that we are not aware of but as far as George knows, Jim only had the one image. However, during the September 1998 field trip, one possible explanation for the one photo theory came to mind. As I was holding up the UFO photo in front of me, looking at the scene, and simultaneously trying to steer the outboard motor to get into Jim\'s position, one thing very quickly became apparent. When I imagined what the real scene must of looked like, it almost sent chills down my spine. Although, UFO#1 looks only like a dot in the photograph, UFO#1 would of looked "" DAM CLOSE ! "" in real life. If Jim wanted to at the time he could of driven the boat towards the UFO and been underneath it in less than 30 seconds and taken more photographs at very close range. Surrounded by ice cold water it wouldn’t surprise me if he would have chosen to do just the opposite; that is, take one quick photo and continue to drive down the lake while keeping a somewhat fearful and very watchful eye on the objectsThe prints were scanned using a UMAX 1220S Scanner ranging from 150 to 1200 dpi.

The photograph was taken at about 9:45am, about the same time of day as the 1970 photo. Because of the higher detail some further analysis could be performed. By measuring rock formations on the island and scaling them on the photograph it was established that Jim was approximately 50 metres (164 ft) from the island. The distance of 250 metres (820 ft) from the island to the shore behind it was scaled off a map. Therefore, the total distance from Jim to the shoreline was approximately 300 metres (984 ft). The 1998 photograph clearly shows that UFO#1 was in front of the tall spruce trees at the shore line. If we assume that UFO#1 is just in front of the trees and therefore 300 metres from Jim, we can calculate its size. After doing the math we get a maximum object diameter of 1.4 metres (4.5 ft). This agrees well with Jim\'s estimate that the objects were about 3 to 4 ft in diameter. Although the objects look like dots in Figure 1, calculations show that UFO#1 would of appeared to be about half the diameter of a full moon to the witnesses. These magnified images can give us the relative diameter and color of the UFOs. The diameter was used to assess object size and distance. The color of the objects also give us some important information. Note that UFOs 1 through 4 (the closest ones to the camera) are not in direct sunlight as the surrounding trees are not illuminated. Therefore, these objects may be glowing by their own source. The glow is of yellow and perhaps of a slightly green color. In contrast, the area around UFOs 5, 6, and 7 up on the mountainside is bathed in morning amber light from the sunrise. The three UFOs also seem to be of a similar amber color suggesting that they may be reflecting sunlight as well. If this is true, it indicates that they are of a solid nature rather than some form of plasma. The questions remains; if the 4 closer objects were exposed to the sunlight, would they also reflect it over and above their glowing yellow color? Did they appear to be of the same amber color to Jim once he observed the 4 closer objects join the other objects further up on the mountainside? Witness Reliability The testimony of the secondhand witness George sounded very sincere. George was curious about what Jim saw and photographed and added that neither him nor Jim have or have had a big interest in the UFO phenomenon. There was no apparent reason for Jim to make up the story or to fake the photograph. Jim’s story which was related by George sounded sincere and the two were close friends. Jim was the Chief Grain Inspector of Canada around that time and therefore it is unlikely he would have risked his credibility by perpetuating a hoax. One question which often comes up is ""Why is there only one photo of the objects when Jim observed them for 15 minutes?"" Of course there may have been more photos that we are not aware of but as far as George knows, Jim only had the one image. However, during the September 1998 field trip, one possible explanation for the one photo theory came to mind. As I was holding up the UFO photo in front of me, looking at the scene, and simultaneously trying to steer the outboard motor to get into Jim\'s position, one thing very quickly became apparent. When I imagined what the real scene must of looked like, it almost sent chills down my spine. Although, UFO#1 looks only like a dot in the photograph, UFO#1 would of looked "" DAM CLOSE ! "" in real life. If Jim wanted to at the time he could of driven the boat towards the UFO and been underneath it in less than 30 seconds and taken more photographs at very close range. Surrounded by ice cold water it wouldn’t surprise me if he would have chosen to do just the opposite; that is, take one quick photo and continue to drive down the lake while keeping a somewhat fearful and very watchful eye on the objectsThe prints were scanned using a UMAX 1220S Scanner ranging from 150 to 1200 dpi.

It was New Year\'s Day, 1970, but it was supposed to be a routine morning shift at Cowichan District Hospital. Nurse Doreen Kendall had started her shift at midnight and was due to get off work at 8 a.m. Not much of a way to greet the New Year, but it was her job. Doreen, a practical nurse, worked on the second floor of the hospital at Duncan, on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Doreen lived in Nanaimo and commuted the twenty-six miles to Duncan. At 5 a.m. Doreen and nurse Frieda Wilson began their usual morning rounds in a four-bed ward. While Frieda attended to the patient nearest the door, Doreen checked on the patient in the next bed, nearest the window. As she did every morning, she went to open the drapes in order to let in a little of the early morning sunshine. When she opened the drapes, she was amazed to see something totally unexpected. Outside, about sixty feet away, a flying object was hovering at a height of about sixty feet, even with the third floor of the hospital. The object was saucer-shaped, with a transparent bubble-like dome in the center, and was tilted slightly towards her. Because the object was tilted toward her, Doreen could see inside the transparent dome, where she saw two humanoid figures standing in front of a chrome, dial-covered instrument panel. She estimated the figures to be about six feet tall, wearing dark clothing, and some sort of headgear. There were seats in front of the instrument panel, but the figures were standing rather than seated. Doreen was stunned. The Cowichan area had a reputation as a UFO ""hotspot"", but she had never expected to see one herself. As she watched, one of the men noticed her and touched the other, apparently to alert him of the fact that they were being watched. The other man looked up, and then manipulated a control, causing the object to begin to move. At this point Doreen called to Frieda Wilson, who came to the window in time to see the object outside. The two then ran to the nurses station and told three other nurses, who reached the window in time to see the object, although it was some distance away by then. The object circled several times and then vanished to the northeast at high speed. The sighting was never explained. source:www.about.comLoy Lawhorn', ""Morphing Metal Saucers over Yuma, Arizona, 1970DATE: 1970 August-roughly-TIME: 3 am-WEATHER: clear, warm, windless, large full moonlight lit, starry night. SIGHTING LOCATION: YUMA ARIZONA THOUGHT GOING THRU MY MIND... So, this is what 'THEY' look like up close, and I bet nobody has everseen them do this! WITNESSES: 16 people...six adults, 10 young people ranging in ages from 49 to 10. NUMBER_OF_OBJECTS: 2 SHAPE_OF_OBJECTS: inverted 'pie-pan' metal saucers, which morphed into sparkling white orbs, then back intosaucers again. DESCRIPTION: I will skip the details of my brother and my interest in sciencefiction....which led to us sitting in the front cab of our camper motorhome, looking at the stars, as our convoy of relatives made a lengthyrest stop. The night was clear as bell. We were parked by a lone hill, on a rarelyused back road, coming into Yuma Arizona. I say rarely used because, the whole hour we were there, no other carshappened past us. We were on the outskirts of the city, parked in the actual dirt road,beneath a tall telephone pole, on the earlier mentioned lone hill. Justa large bump of dirt really, that had missed getting leveled with therest of the dirt road. I remember the full moon being so bright one could see far into thefield across the road from us. In this same field, left of the drivers side of the camper, about 500ft. away, I noticed a string of blue lights, lying parallel on the ground, and Ithought we might be near an airfield landing strip. The lights were like small dark blue stars, the way a black light bulb looks these days. There were two large oak trees in the vast field of yellow waving drygrass, close to the dirt road, about a 300 ft. away. The grass was notvery tall, just like the dead, sun scorched grasses of any givenfield...about 5 ft. high. I am 5 ft. 7 inches tall, so the grass would be waist high to me, if Iwere out standing in it. I thought the blue lights were a landing strip, because they were thathot electric blue color, and there were about 18-20 of them, equallyspaced apart in the field of dead grass, but there were no buildings, orfarms, or anything for miles all around us, and NO AIRPORT! just the twohuge oak trees, the twin strips of landing lights on the ground, theendless grass, and the black, diamond twinkling silhouette of the YumaArizona city skyline in the far distance. A thought crossed my mind for a quick second. Where was the source ofelectrical power for these lone lights, and who turns them off, and onin an empty field, in the middle of nowhere? To the right hand side, lay the city's brightly lit black skyline. Ithad to have been at least 10 miles away, but as the land was generallyflat, we had a totally unobstructed view of it. Wondering why planeswould want to land in the middle of an empty field, by an oak tree noless, we watched the supposed landing strip to pass the time, hoping tosee an approaching plane coming in for a landing.... We looked away forjust a moment, to ask for a snack plate through the adjoining camperservice window. We hadn't even looked away two minutes, when I noticed, a set of landinglights, one red, two white, and one greenish aqua, coming in low, justover the grass of the field, headed straight towards us! How could I have missed the sound of this approaching flight? I thoughtit was strange, they were airplane lights, but it was flying way toolow, vertical to the horizontal landing light strip, and it was comingin painfully slow...too slow, like it was gliding or crashing? We didn'tno which, so we watched it for about 15 minutes. We wound down thewindow to listen if we could hear a motor in distress or something... Earlier, there had been crickets chirping, and all sorts of fresh nightsounds, now there was nothing, just a deafening roar of silence.. Nonoise from the low flying plane either.. The plane could not have beenone mile away from us, approaching, but it was taking it forever to getto us. Agonizingly slow, so slow it appeared to be standing still, which mighthave been the case! When it finally reached the two oak trees, it flew between them, but notpast them, and began to ascend, slowly, straight up through the lowestbranches, and low and behold, another set of lights, exactly the same,rose up right underneath the first pair! I said, if I didn't know any better, I would have sworn that, thatsecond plane came straight out of the ground, or had been waiting on theground for the first plane's arrival... The spread of the planes' wing-span was the length of maybe a commercialtour plane, or a crop duster, it was not that big, about as wide as 5average cars parked head to tail lengthwise. Strange thing, these planeswere still moving forward painfully SLOW...and flying just over the topof the grass...skimming it actually. When both planes reached the oak tree branches, the upper most oneveered right, seemingly to purposely give the bottom set of lights roomto move up. We then knew we would now get a better view of these two slow planes asthey rose as high as the top leaves of the oak trees they passed, andthey were STILL approaching us. My brother wanted to shine our blindingly bright camper spotlight onthem...but I warned him not to...very unsure why, but I told myself, hemight blind the pilots, but these planes were doing things no pilotedearth planes could do, and maybe the light they might shine back at usmight not be so good. Maybe they were helicopters? We thought this because they rose straight up in the air, and hoveredthere for minutes at a time, then they seemed to play with each other,turning, backing up, gyrating back and forth, like boats rocking on deepwater, and flitting about, just like a humming bird can do. They seemedaware of each other's slightest movement, like they were alive? Plane #1 was now just above the two trees in the field, #2 was justabove the grass, in plain view, but darkly shadowed by the trees' densebranches. They were both still facing us by the position of the landing lights,when plane #1 suddenly descended so quickly and violently atop #2, weknew they would crash together.... and crash they did, and there wasabsolutely NO NOISE. We saw them hit, wobble as if stunned, and just bounce off each other,continuing slowly, both ascending through the tree's thick heavybranches. The branches bent, and gave way around them, but didn't break. There wasNO NOISE of leaves rustling, as this happened, and we were close enoughto have heard that. By now they were just over the treetop's leaves, moving into thebrilliant full moonlight, as they silhouetted against the moon, justabove the telephone pole on the one dirt hill, now, on our right handside, we began screaming. The planes were not planes! They had no wings, no sound, and they were completely circular...Liketwo gigantus pie pans put together! To this day I believe they heard usscream, because up until then, they seemed only interested in eachother, and totally unaware of our presence. They hovered mid-air, after the screams, then began to descend slowly,right on top of us! They were close enough for us to view the full under side of the shipssince they were no higher than the top of the telephone pole...lets see,pole plus hill... They were just about 50 ft. above us, and they gave an appearance ofbeing as light as the air itself by how gently they floated down. Theywere huge solid metal objects reflecting in the moonlight, but theyfloated, and gyrated about like weightless spinning leaves in the warmwindless night, and they were still descending. They were close enough for me to hit them, if I threw a rock, and Ican't throw worth a dime! They were bigger than our camper and they were going to land right ontop of us! All our party heard us screaming, and stuck their heads out the camperdoor, and out their several car doors, and looking up, they startedscreaming too... The saucer shaped circles were nickel colored, dull smooth steel on top with a raised flat darker top, andunderneath an equally protruding flat black circular portioned bottom.No windows, seams, or doors were apparent. The colored landing lights,which had no rays, shone bright head on, but dully, when view fromunderneath! They were low enough now to block out the moonlight, and they were 3xthe size of our camper which was the largest vehicle, holding a familyof seven! OH! They WERE going to land on top of us!!! Suddenly, in the den of ourcommotion, as if becoming aware of our terror, they stopped descending,just stopped in mid-air, whirling like fitted stationary gyroscopes.Flying side by side, the two saucers went up on their sides together,from a horizontal to a vertical position, in perfect synchronization,and now stood in the sky, a stones' throw above us, like two huge pewtersilver wheels.Suddenly an intensely bright light like a 4th of July sparkler startedpushing out the middle of their dark bottom protrusions, while the samething was happening simultaneously on the top protrusion, and all thismet together around the rims length wise in a cohesive whole. They literally transformed from dull flat saucers into huge glowingorbs, right in front of, or right over our heads, about 25 ft. up, orcloser, since I could hit them with a rock if I had had the nerve tothrow one! no sparks dropped, or heat or noise was apparent. no smell ofsmoke or exhausts.This took only a matter of seconds to happen, and the minute thetransformation was complete, both balls of light shot off like white hotmeteors, in the direction of the Yuma city skyline... It took less thana minute for them to reach the city, where they hovered up and down justabove it, looking for all the world like bouncing stars, glitteringblue, then white, then red then green. They flew all along the top of the city, then they started back towardus! Food, supplies, and people flew everywhere. Getting in our perspectivevehicles, and gunning the motors, we went from 0 to 90 in six minutesflat, raising a cloud of dust so thick we could barely see through it! Looking out our windows, and up, we could see the objects were back, andfollowing us from the sky. They were now as high as any commercial plane, and looked like twoplanes from up there, but they were still flying in sync, and turning ona dime up there! They had their row of landing lights back on, and they were saucersagain, but this time the lights were flashing like a real plane woulddo. They followed us (chased?) to the edge of the cities' outskirts where weslowed down, feeling safe enough to park, and watch them veer off, andup, back in the general direction from which we had just come! So yousee, I know UFOs can transform shapes, and saw how they did it... I got the distinct impression they were as curious about us, as we wereas scared of them. They seemed playful, if a machine could have a personality, like onekitten would play with another. I think they thought our camper and cars were worth looking at. until wepopped out of them....like fleas or a virus, I suppose! Just animpression I got! Indulge me! We saw many, many more types after that, a few up very close, but notquite as personal! I continue to watch the skies. I am 52 years old now, and I have had enough UFO experiences to last alifetime. They keep happening though! I believe they still frequent Arizona, and various parts of Mexico, theygot us there too! I have seen them actually disappear right while I was watching, so Iknow they can do that as well. I have to add, I thought they only frequent the rural areas, I waswrong, a couple of good city experiences took care of that! I tell this story to whomever wants to hear it. It never gets dull forme...this was before video cameras, and for some reason I am glad no onethought to use one of our, then, antiquated cameras with a flashbulb. geesh! I will consider writing some more of my UFO experiences soon. I see there is more of an interest now than when I was coming up. I was 19 or 20 when this happened to my family while traveling acrossthe USA from California, to Mississippi.

A UFO investigation reported in the Billerica Minuteman has now caught the attention of an international audience, after a couple in town posted a firsthand narrative on a Canadian UFO Web site and UFO sites worldwide picked up links both to their account and the Minuteman article.The couple, identified only as Robert and Anne, are scheduled to share their story in an interview with radio talk show host Jeff Rense Friday, Oct. 20 at 7 p.m. on the Jeff Rense Show, which is broadcast on a satellite network.  The show is also available on line at www.rense.com.     The couple are scheduled as guests of Vike, who, holds a regular spot on the radio show and who posted the narrative on his UFO research Web site, hbccufo.org.      ""I knew this story and experience was a dandy, as we do not hear many stories like this,"" Vike said.     The report is also under investigation by Mark Petty, a former Billerica resident now living in Nashua, N.H., and a volunteer with Massachusetts Mutual UFO Network, which follows up on reports of unusual sightings of or contacts with objects in the sky.      Petty, who has given presentations on UFO investigations at the Billerica Senior Center, said he gave a talk on the couple\'s experience at the network\'s conference Oct. 14 in Watertown.    Petty said the couple were counseled not to talk publicly about their experience until the investigation was complete, but said, ""It\'s their decision. They are the people who actually experienced it.""    Light in the night sky      In the narrative, Robert said the encounter occurred Sunday, Dec. 12, 2004, when he and Anne saw a ball of light in the night sky about 7:10 p.m.    He said they saw the apparition through a sliding door leading to a deck off the kitchen. He described ""a huge ball of brilliant white light coming toward the house from the west,"" slightly above the tops of trees.    As the object came closer, he said it appeared to grow bigger, and stopped above the house, where it appeared ""absolutely huge, maybe two, maybe three football fields. The white light engulfed everything.""      Despite the intense light, the glare didn\'t hurt their eyes, he said, but hovered silently for a few minutes before a pale blue light emitted from the underside and formed a perfect square on the deck.     Robert said the light fully engulfed Anne, who was lifted off the deck, prompting Robert to open the sliding door with one hand and grab Anne\'s waist by other. He said he pulled her into the house and the shut door.     When he looked out again, the strange light was gone, he said.      During the ordeal, Anne went unconscious. When she came around, she said she remembered seeing the blue light and that Robert described it as square, but could not remember any details after that.     A short while later, they said they received a phone call from Robert\'s sister and her husband, about five miles to the east, saying they too saw a ball of white light trailing a blue tail, moving parallel to the ground.     Robert said he noticed blisters on his hand, just below his middle finger.        Strange happenings cited      In the report, Robert said he and Anne subsequently noticed unusual occurrences in their own home, including a microwave open beeping at random and objects flying off shelves.     Robert said many of these occurrences would happen during the day, and Anne would relate them when he returned home from work.     Hypnosis helped her recall details but didn\'t work for him, he said.     However, he recalled an eerie instance in which he said he administered CPR to Anne as she lay on the floor.      ""After I got her off the floor and on to the couch I looked into the kitchen and saw what looked like snow or fine pellets of Styrofoam pouring in through the sliding door - I guess didn\'t shut it all the way. After icing my hand for awhile I told Anne, I\'m going in the garage to get the shop vac to clean up the mess.\' When I looked again all the white stuff was gone and the small carpet in the kitchen was dry.""      He added, ""Also the white light outside looked like it flowed like a liquid wrapping itself around everything,"" and no shadows formed.      Billerica police said they did not receive any reports of an unusual sighting in the sky Dec. 12, but said from time to time, they, like all police departments, do get calls from concerned residents of a strange light or sound that turns out to be something ordinary.     Petty said someone also reported seeing something peculiar in the sky over Billerica around 6:30 p.m. on Dec. 29 and reported the incident to the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Wash.     That report describes ""a very large, circular, bright-white light above the clouds going around and around in a very large circle"" at high speeds. The report said the witness looked out again and saw the same light about an hour later and insisted it wasn\'t a search light or plane.      Without ruling out any possibilities, Petty said the light may have come from an area business, such as a gym in nearby Tewksbury.     Petty said investigators work to collect information from reported UFO witnesses, and said the overwhelming majority of objects turn out to be less than extraterrestrial, including lights from businesses, crafts from air force bases, satellites and meteors.     About 5 percent remain unexplained, he said.        Seeking clues      In his probe in the reported Dec. 12, 2004 incident, Petty said, among other steps, he made inquiries to several area police departments, interviewed many of the couple\'s neighbors and have filed a Freedom of Information Act request from the federal Aviation Administration regarding aerial activity in the area on that evening.     He said Billerica police provided a printout of police log entries from the time of the reported sighting, but that log activity suggests no unusual reported occurrences.     He said Burlington police sent a written response indicating nothing unusual. An inquiry to Bedford police received no response, he said.      Anne, 58, a disabled contractor, agreed to meet recently with a Minuteman reporter, but would not give her or Robert\'s last name. She showed the small porch where she said the object appeared and which she said lifted her a few feet in the air before Robert grabbed her and pulled her inside.      But she said any physical evidence - the burns on Robert\'s hands, which she showed in a photograph, and the powdery residue she described - are gone.     She said, after the incident, her sister called on the phone to say she, too, had seen a bright object with a trailing tail while traveling on a highway.     They\'re not UFO or science fiction buffs, she said, and books and movies of that ilk are sparse in their collection. Anne, who said she recalled a peculiar sighting of a lighted object in her youth, said the experiences she reported suggest the possibility of extraterrestrial presence. However, she remains as mystified as anyone, she said.  She said, ""I\'ve always been very open-minded. I\'d be arrogant to think we are the only beings in this vast universe.""

Everything became still, and the pond became like glass as the object sank. Then they saw a whirlpool in the pond about 8 to 10 feet across that moved very fast across the pond towards them. When it hit the water there was steam that went up from the object then the object disappeared to reappear in another area. One of the children got on a boat that was at the bank, and she could see lights around the sides and the object looked like metal. Two other children said they saw the lights, but two of them said it looked yellow under the water. Two were still watching it when they saw the water and grass around the pond next to them start to move violently, so they got scared and ran to the house. They were very disturbed by what they saw, and it took three hours before they would tell us what had happened. They range from 7 to 13 years old and all had the same story. The next day we drove around and found truck like tracks that led towards the pond, but stopped before they got to the pond. There was a circle where the grass had been bent down in an arc shape at the edge of the pond as it splashed into the pond. They said there was a cloud over them that was swirling. The older children thought it might be a tornado that sounded like a muffled lawn mower. I asked the OSU Extension Agency to check for contamination. They informed me there had been two other similar incidents. Source & References:www.MUFON.com']"
1947, ,"['1947-Portland, Oregon, Flying Saucers Seen; Multiple WitnessesOriginal Title: Saucers made no ordinary fireworks By Phil StanfordThe Portland Tribune, Jul 3, 2006 What I do know, however, because I read about it in the newspapers, is that 59 years ago today, scores of Portlanders, including pilots, police officers, and just plain civilians like you and me, saw – or at least thought they saw – flying saucers above the Rose City.According to no less a source than The Oregonian, the first flying saucers, or whatever they were, were sighted directly over Oaks Amusement Park.Immediately, the police bureau put out an “all cars” alert, which was answered by three patrolmen who said they saw them, too.One of them, Earl Patterson, identified as an “air corps veteran,” said they were traveling fast, “wobbling and weaving,” and in his opinion they were not airplanes.The other two, Walter Lissy and Robert Ellis, both civilian pilots themselves, said what they saw were discs, making sudden changes in direction and traveling at a “terrific speed.”• • •Capt. K.A. Prehn, along with two of his men at Harbor Patrol headquarters on Irving, reported seeing several “discs” pass overhead at a height of 10,000 feet.They were unsure whether there were three or six of them because of confusing flashes from the objects, which “seemed to oscillate, weave and turn until … sometimes only a crescent was visible.”“Captain Prehn described the sight as a ‘wobbling hubcap.’ A regular plane was in the sky at the time,” the news account continued, “but these were not planes, they agreed.”Meanwhile, over at state police headquarters on Southeast McLoughlin, Sgt. Claude Cross reported seeing two objects that looked from a distance like “toy balloons, almost pure white, traveling sideways, with no flashing lights.”• • •But lest you be tempted to take the easy way out – which is, of course, that these mysterious objects were actually top-secret CIA weather balloons – there’s the report from a United Airlines plane en route from Boise to Portland that night.Or as the headline at the top of the first page of the July 5 Oregonian unmincingly put it:“Air Liner Crew Confirms Flying Discs Over State”Shortly after takeoff from Boise, World War II veteran Captain E.J. Smith, plus his co-pilot and a stewardess, spotted nine of them. Upon landing, Smith described them as “bigger than aircraft … very thin, very flat on the bottom and … rough or irregular on the top.”The discs, which were flying at about the same altitude as the plane, followed them for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing.“No object I know of could disappear so quickly,” observed Smith.The Oregonian’s headlines the next day read:“Flying Saucers Everywhere; New Tales Convert Skeptics”They just don’t write headlines like that over there anymore.But then, to be fair, we haven’t had a decent UFO flyby in a long time, either.Contact Phil Stanford by phone at 503-546-5166 or by e-mail at philstanford@portlandtribune.com.

The fishermen couldn\'t make out much detail from their boat but whenever the light illuminated the ""little men,"" they could see some sort of apparatus around their waist.When the witness was asked how tall these men were, he replied, ""About the size of a 10 year old boy."" After a few minutes, the ""little men"" entered the ""submarine"" which began to glow so brightly that the fishermen couldn\'t see the object. It then submerged.

Palmer passed the story onto Kenneth Arnold, who was investigating UFO reports in the Northwest. Arnold interviewed Crisman an his associate Harold Dahl who claimed they were harbour patrolmen (their first lie). Crisman reported that they had seen a doughnut-shaped craft dump piles of slaglike material on the beach of Maury Island in Puget Sound. The next morning a mysterious man in black had threatened Dahl, who claimed the man said \'I know a great deal more about this experience of yours that you will want to believe.\'. The 2 men showed Arnold the material who in turn contacted an Army Air Force intelligence officer, Lieutenant Frank Brown, who flew up from Hamilton Field in California in the company of another Air Force officer. The 2 Air Force officers immediately recognised the material as ordinary aluminium but did not say so in front of Arnold due to the fact that he would feel embarrassed. While flying back to Hamilton, their B-25 caught fire and crashed, killing both officers. Crisman and Dahl later confessed to investigators that they had made up the story. Before his death Crisman changed the Maury Incident story to that of an American Plane dropping radioactive waste instead of a UFO dropping unknown substances. A sceptic association investigated the case, which they date to 21 June 1947,  instead of 31 July 1947 (?), and gives the explanation ""foundry slag, unrelated plane crash.""

On the morning of July 10, 1947, Mr. John H. Janssen, editor of the Daily Record (an American aviation journal) was flying his own plane from Morristown Airport in New Jersey.  He spotted six, luminous spherical craft with hazy rings around them flying in a trail high in the sky above him.  He grabbed his camera and shot a picture.  He was only able to get four of the six objects in the image frame. Two weeks later, on July 23rd, he had another encounter of what looked to him like the same or very similar aircraft.  He was again flying his airplane out of Morristown and was at 6,000ft. ""While my eyes played over the horizon, I became aware of a shaft of light that seemed like that of a photographer\'s flash bulb.  It came from aloft, very high up.  It was above that position over my plane\'s nose that flier\'s call  11 O\'clock.  At first I thought it was merely the reflected sun bouncing off the sides of an exceedingly high flying aircraft.  I gave it no more thought.  But then the engine of my own plane began to perform peculiarly.  It coughed and sputtered spasmodically.  So I pulled on the carburetor heat and gave it full throttle hoping to thaw any ice that might be accumulating in the carburetor.  The engine emitted one final wheezing cough and then quit.  Now, the nose of my plane, instead of dropping to a normal glide, remained... rigid... fixed on the horizon, in its normal level flight attitude. Abruptly, I became aware that my plane was now defying the basic law of gravity. I became frightened and close to panic at so weird a predicament. I saw that the airspeed indicator was at zero! There was now an odd prickling, electric-like sensation coursing through my body. I had an eerie feeling that I was being watched and examined by something that minutely studied my features, my clothing, and my airplane... I flicked a cold bead of perspiration from my eye. Then I saw it! Above and slightly beyond my left wing tip was a strange wraith-like craft, one of the flying objects! Its flanged and protecting rim was dotted on either side with steamer-like portholes. It seemed to radiate a dull metallic hue that conveyed an impression of natural strength, and a super-intelligence not of this planet. It was motionless. Perhaps a quarter of a mile away... beyond, and slightly higher, I could see another (similar) object, seemingly fixed in the sky. I assumed that the second strange ship was but waiting for the one nearest me to complete its examination. Then I had the most unaccountable urge to reach up and snap on the magneto switch. I had turned it off when the engine quit. I switched both magnetos to the on position. Slowly the propeller began to turn... then the engine burst into a steady rhythmic roar. The plane nosed up into a stall, dropped off, picked up airspeed and steadied under control,"" recalled Mr. Janssen. source: http://www.nicap.dabsol.co.uk/morristown.htm', 'Nine Flying Discs Encountered by B-17-Utah, July 16, 1947The ABC Program relative to UFOs has prompted me to provide details of my sighting of unidentified flying objects. This is the first time I have offered this event to any type of media. I was a member of the United States Air Force at the time that I saw nine flying discs. I dutifully reported my sighting to the Operations Section at Travis Air Force Base as had been directed by the Senior Officer. The pilot of our aircraft was also the officer in charge of the section that I was assigned to at the time. I was the Aircraft Distribution Officer of the Far East Air Materiel Command located in Fuchu, Japan in 1947.I had a project to take B-17 aircraft from the theater to Middletown Air Depot, Pennsylvania to have them modified to be air rescue aircraft. This involves such modification to accommodate a lifeboat attached the bomb bay which could be dropped for rescue at sea. I was assigned to one of these trips to observe the modification process. I became a passenger on the flight of a B-17 from Japan to the Middletown Air Depot. The crew picked up a modified B-17 aircraft (without the life boat) for return to Japan.On that return flight I had positioned myself in the nose of the aircraft. As we approached Promontory Point, Utah at 15:30 hours, 16 July, 1947, I noticed several objects rising from the Salt Flats. At first I thought they were big white birds but they were coming towards our aircraft at such great speed that I became alarmed. However, in just a few moments they veered to the left of our aircraft, but close enough for me to identify them as nine round disks, approximately 40-60 feet in diameter with light blue underbellies.They were in what appeared to be a V formation of three, three, and three. They passed off the left wing of our aircraft in a climbing flight. I immediately made my way to the cockpit to advise the pilot of my sighting. He had not seen them. However, the flight engineer, Technical Sergeant GJH (name withheld), Serial Number AFxxxxxxxx, did see them and confirmed my sighting. We only differed on one thing. T/SGT. H saw them as they were a little lower than our aircraft and he described the top of them as sand colored.I had been in the Philippines Islands and Japan for approximately for 18 months and had not been aware of the UFO excitement in the States at that time. The weather over the sighting area was perfectly clear and there was no way that I could have been mistaken about what I had seen. I talk about this event to my friends and others that want to listen to my experience. Since there is so much reaction to stories of such sightings, I have never gone beyond just telling about the event. Also, I never had any further contact with T/SGT. H since he was assigned to a different organization than mine. I have kept the record of this event in my wallet all these years to make sure that the data was immediately available to me in the event someone wanted names and dates. I also put a copy of the data in my personal strongbox for safe keeping.There is one thing that I regret about this event. I had just purchased a movie camera with a telephoto lens while in the States on this trip, and had it right in front of me at the time, and I did not think enough to take pictures of the sighting. However, on the other hand, the whole thing was over in just a few seconds and had I tried to take movies of it I may have missed the whole show.I thought this might be of interest to your group.ETW COL.

On the way home he was unusually quiet. Finally he said, ""They were too big."" He then told me that 10 years earlier he had been stationed at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, where he was part of a film unit.One day an officer came and told him and another man to grab a couple of 16mm movie cameras and follow him. He took them to a heavily guarded hanger. Inside was a badly damaged circular craft and about an acre of debris placed on a canvas tarp. My father and his friend were instructed to get footage on everything. They did so. They then were taken into a refrigerated unit at the rear of the hanger. Inside the unit was what my father described as a museum case holding the bodies of two small creatures;  gray, thin with large eyes but no eyelids. One showed some severe wounds, the other had no visible injuries. They were instructed to get footage of the creatures. When the case was opened to allow a better shot there was a smell similar to dead fish. When they had finished filming the cameras were confiscated instead of being taken back to the lab for processing. My father said he and his friend were literally sworn to secrecy. My father only spoke of this to me that one time and me promise never to tell anyone. Since he recently passed away I feel I am now at liberty to relate his story. My father was very patriotic and very religious and not prone to making things up. Out of respect for his privacy and mine I submit this report anonymously.

Rickwood of the P&SS Special Investigation Section, related to his superiors the facts:On 10th November 1966 a telephone message was received from Flight Lieutenant Williams, RAF Shawbury, reporting that a Mrs. Foulkes of [Address of the witness] Shrewsbury, had complained that his daughter had been frightened by an object in the sky whilst she had been driving along the A5 road near Great Ness at 2355 hours on 8th November 1966.This object had emitted brilliant lights and radiation beams. On arriving home her daughter had been in a distressed condition and she had discovered marks on the car, which she considered were burn marks.On 14th November 1966, Miss Diane Foulkes, aged 22 years, a typist employed in Shrewsbury was seen at her home in the presence of her parents. She stated that she had received a letter dated 11th November 1966 from RAF Shawbury signed by a Flight Lieutenant Penny informing her that no service aircraft had been flying in that area at the time of the incident.She was now satisfied that the incident was in no way connected with the Royal Air Force or the Armed Forces.She then went on to relate her experiences connected with this enquiry. There had been two similar incidents. The first occurred two years ago in November 1964, when she had been driving from Shrewsbury to her home along the A5 road.This was at about 0200 hours as she neared the Montford Bridge over the River Severn. Approximately midway between Shrewsbury and Great Ness a brightly lit circular object appeared in the sky above her car.She had been frightened and had accelerated along the road. The object had kept pace with her remaining at the same height until she arrived home.She had told her mother and father who also watched the object.She described the object as an especially bright light in the sky which remained stationary due west from their home for about half an hour. It had then rapidly diminished in size and they assumed it had accelerated away from them. No sound was heard from the object.The light was yellow in colour and became red as it diminished.The second incident occurred on the 8th November 1966 at 2355 hours and again whilst she was returning from Shrewsbury on the same road.The object had again appeared at Montford Bridge but this time it was much lower in the sky and on the north side of the road.On this occasion she could see rays of light shooting from the object which had again appeared to keep station with her car until she arrived home. At one time during the journey the object travelled near her and the rays seemed to come towards the right hand side of her car.She felt a bump against that side as if they had struck it. At this moment she felt as if she had received an electric shock and had felt a severe pain in her neck.The left-hand side headlight of the car also went out. This made her extremely frightened. When she got home she felt very ill and had complained to her parents.The object again remained stationary in the sky north of her home and had not been seen by her parents. They had noticed it for a short time before going inside her home.There had been no sign of the object on the following morning.Miss Foulkes\' parents confirmed seeing an object in the sky on both occasions as described by their daughter and agreed with her descriptions of these.Miss Foulkes further stated that she believed that the objects could be associated with a Mr Griffin who lived in the area and who is reputed to have made contact with these objects and actually entered one and met one of the occupants.He is also alleged to make his contacts with them at Montford Bridge.The local civil police had no information or reports of sightings of objects in the sky. There is no evidence to associate the incidents complained of with the Royal Air Force and the complainant Miss Foulkes is now satisfied that the incidents are unexplainable and are in no way connected with the Armed Forces.In essence, that is the file. It is clear from examining its contents that the witness had reported some stunning experiences: ""the rays of shooting light"" that enveloped her car; the electric shock-like pain that surged through her neck as the vehicle was bathed in the beam of light; the loss of power from the car\'s headlights (something that is reported time and again in UFO encounters); and the potentially-worrying fact that the experience had left the witness ""very ill.""Perhaps the most significant factor, however, was the reference of the Provost and Security Services to a man in the near vicinity that had reputedly ""made contact with these objects and actually entered one and met the occupants.""Prior to the 1970s, very little exposure was given to so-called alien abduction incidents; however, many of the factors present in the P&SS report lead me to believe that something very strange indeed had taken place in the Great Ness area of Shrewsbury in 1966, and that that ""something"" was very possibly connected with abduction-like encounters.Oddly, despite the fact that the official file on this case was declassified more than half a decade ago -and the document at issue has been examined by a number of UFO researchers - it seems that little or no attempt has been made to resolve the case.Perhaps now with its contents highlighted here, someone will take a fresh look at the case and attempt to resolve the question of what really happened nearly 40 years ago at Montford Bridge.', 'UFO Landing at Grange Reserve, 1966Academic throws light on 40-year-old UFO mystery-October 2, 2005.Just what did flash out of the sky and into the lives of hundreds that April day? Stephen Cauchi reports.A CANBERRA academic is investigating one of Australia\'s most compelling UFO mysteries, a sighting by hundreds of people in the Melbourne suburb of Westall on April 6, 1966.More than 200 students and staff from two schools watched as the object landed in a nearby paddock, lifted off and vanished.Shane Ryan, an English lecturer at the University of Canberra, is interviewing dozens of witnesses for a book he hopes to publish on the 40th anniversary of the sighting.Mr Ryan, 38, was alerted to the events in the 1980s by a housemate who was there. Unlike most UFO sightings, the Westall object had a large number of credible witnesses. It was viewed in daylight and attracted a forceful response from police and the RAAF.""It had these rather interesting elements which indicated to me that, unlike some other so-called UFO stories, there was some substance to this,"" he told The Sunday Age.""I knew the 40th anniversary was coming up next year, so I thought it was timely to do some research on it.""Mr Ryan has interviewed about 30 witnesses, mostly former staff and students from the Westall secondary and primary schools. He has tried obtaining police and RAAF reports, but so far with little luck. The story was covered then by Channel Nine, The Age and local newspapers.On the UFO, everyone seems to agree, Mr Ryan says. It was a low-flying, silver/grey shining object, either of classical flying saucer shape or close to it, ""a cup turned upside down on a saucer"". The students were familiar with light aircraft because the schools were close to Moorabbin Airport. Although the UFO was of similar size, ""everyone said straight away that they knew it was not a plane,"" Mr Ryan said, nor a weather balloon.The object was in view for up to 20 minutes, and many saw it descend. Most agree it landed behind pine trees at the Grange Reserve. Dozens of students ran across what was then an open paddock to the reserve to investigate, but the object had lifted off and vanished.Other details are sketchier. The UFO appears to have left a circle of scorched grass; others say several circles were left in paddocks bordering Grange Reserve.Many witnesses, not all, report seeing aircraft, up to five, trailing the UFO. Some say it made no sound, others say it did.Many reported that police/air force/military personnel inspected the site; some (not all) say the authorities burnt the site. The Dandenong Journal, for which the story was front-page news two weeks in a row, reported that ""students and staff have been instructed to \'talk to no-one\' about the incident."" Nevertheless, one teacher, Andrew Greenwood, gave the paper a detailed account.""It was silvery-grey and seemed to thicken at times,"" he said. ""The thickening was similar to when a disc is turned a little to show the underside.""One of the closest witnesses was a boy whose family leased land at Grange Reserve for horses.Shaun Matthews (not a student at Westall) was on holidays and spending time on the land.""I saw the thing come across the horizon and drop down behind the pine trees,"" he told The Sunday Age this week. ""I couldn\'t tell you what it was. It certainly wasn\'t a light aircraft or anything of the like …""I saw the thing drop down behind the pine trees and saw it leave again. I couldn\'t tell you how long it was there for, it was such a long time ago.""Mr Matthews, 51 and now living in Greenvale, said the object ""went up and off very very rapidly"".""I went over and there was a circle in the clearing. It looked like it had been cooked or boiled, not burnt as I remember,"" he said. ""A heap of kids from Westall primary and high school came charging through to see what had happened — \'look at this, look at that, we saw it as well\', that sort of thing. It was a bit of a talking point for a couple of days.""Mr Matthews said the object, about the size of ""two family cars"", passed him at a distance of about ""four football fields"". ""It was silvery, but it had a sort-of purple hue to it, very bright, but not bright enough that you couldn\'t look at it,"" he said.""I saw that it dropped down behind the trees, and I thought, \'hello, hang on\'. A minute or so later, it went straight up, just gone.""He said police and other officials interviewed his mother. But he cannot remember them burning the landing site, as others have alleged. And he did not see any light aircraft trailing the object, as others did.""The way this thing moved there is no way it could have been a weather balloon or a light aircraft,"" he said.""A helicopter? No way — no noise, wrong shape, and it didn\'t move like it. It came out of the distance, stopped, and then just dropped.""It didn\'t just sort of cruise and then slightly descend at an angle. It just stopped, dropped, and then went straight up.""The Victorian UFO Research Society investigated the incident. VUFORS secretary Tony Cook said Westall remained one of Australia\'s major unexplained UFO cases.The top one was the case of Frederick Valentich, a 20-year-old Melbourne pilot whose light plane disappeared while flying over Bass Strait in 1978.In the last minutes of radio communication, Valentich reported seeing a UFO hovering above his plane. He and his craft were never recovered.""It\'s pretty well documented,"" Mr Cook said. ""That\'s probably the most important one because it involves the disappearance of a person.""Mr Cook said the society\'s stance on UFOs was that, ""there are people out there seeing unusual things in the sky at times and they can\'t be explained. But it\'s a very big leap to go from unexplained things in the sky to extraterrestrials.""Most witnesses, including Mr Matthews, say the UFO was not an aircraft or helicopter. But Westall is only six kilometres from Moorabbin Airport, and the object was roughly headed in that direction, travelling north to south.""It sounds to me like some sort of experimental craft, very much Earth-based,"" Steve Roberts, of Australian Skeptics, said.""It is an interesting event with lots of witnesses and what we now call a crop circle.""Accounts are confused. Some have the object landing and taking off again, others say \'a paddock over which the object seemed to hover\'.""As well, ""if there was a whole swag of officials investigating it, there must be an official report in RAAF archives somewhere"".But Mr Ryan said that no one at the RAAF knew of the incident.But given the history of the case — the way students and staff were told to keep quiet from the start — that was not surprising, he said.""As I got a little bit older, I got a little more interested in the social and historical aspects of the story, how something like this could have happened and how it reflected society at the time, and how authorities responded to it,"" he said.""There\'s been a layer of secrecy that was very, very prominent in this story from the beginning.""Contact Shane Ryan on shaneryan@velocitynet.com.ausource and references:Shane Ryanhttp://www.theage.com.au/news/national/academic-throws-light-on-40yearold-ufo-mystery/2005/10/01/1127804696941.html#Photo: Craig SillitoeIllustration: Matt Golding', 'Richard Hall<---- Image : Deputy Spauer\'s DrawingOne of the most dramatic encounters by police officers with an apparently structured, low-level UFO occurred in the early morning of April 17, 1966. Officers of the Portage County, Ohio, Sheriff\'s Department first saw the object rise up from near ground level, bathing them in light, near Ravenna, Ohio, about 5:00 AM.Ordered by the sergeant to pursue the object, they chased it for eighty-five miles across the border into Pennsylvania, as it seemed to play a cat-and-mouse game with them. Along the route, police officers from other jurisdictions saw the object and joined in the chase.  Deputy Sheriff Dale Spaur and Mounted Deputy Wilbur \'Barney’ Neff had left their scout car to investigate an apparently abandoned automobile on Route 224.  Spaur described the sighting in these words:  “I always look behind me so no one can come up behind me.  And when I looked in this wooded area behind us, I saw this thing.  At this time it was coming up... to about tree top level.  I\'d say about one hundred feet. It started moving toward us...As it came over the trees, I looked at Barney and he was still watching the car... and he didn\'t say nothing and the thing kept getting brighter and the area started to get light... I told him to look over his shoulder, and he did.  ""He just stood there with his mouth open for a minute, as bright as it was, and he looked down. And I started looking down and I looked at my hands and my clothes weren\'t burning or anything, when it stopped right over on top of us.The only thing, the only sound in the whole area was a hum... like a transformer being loaded or an overloaded transformer when it changes...   ""I was petrified, and, uh, so I moved my right foot, and everything seemed to work all right.  And evidently he made the same decision I did, to get something between me and it, or us and it, or whatever you would say.  So we both went for the car, we got in the car and we sat there...""  As they watched, the UFO moved toward the east, and then stopped again. Spaur picked up the microphone and reported to the dispatcher. At this time, the object was about 250 feet away, brilliantly lighting up the area (""It was very bright; it\'d make your eyes water,"" Spaur said.)  Sergeant Schoenfelt, off duty at the station, told them to follow it and keep it under observation while they tried to get a photo unit to the scene.  Spear and Neff turned south on Route 183, then back east on Route 224, which placed the object to their right, and out the left window.  “At this time,  said Spaur, ""it came straight south, just one motion, buddy, just a smooth glide... and began moving east with them pacing it, just to their right at an estimated altitude of 300-500 feet, illuminating the ground beneath it.  Once more the UFO darted to the north, now left of the car, and they sped up to over 100 mph to keep pace with it.""  As the sky became brighter with predawn light, Spaur and Neff saw the UFO in silhouette, with a vertical projection at its rear.  The object began to take on a metallic appearance as the chase continued.   Spaur kept up a running conversation with other police cars that were trying to catch up with them.  Once when they made a wrong turn at an intersection, the object stopped, then turned and came back to their position.  Police Officer Wayne Huston of East Palestine, Ohio, situated near the Pennsylvania border, had been monitoring the radio broadcasts, and was parked at an intersection he knew the Portage County officers would he passing soon.Shortly afterward, he saw the UFO pass by with the sheriff\'s cruiser in hot pursuit.   He swung out and joined the chase.  At Conway, Pennsylvania, Spaur spotted another parked police car and stopped to enlist his aid, since their cruiser was almost out of gas. The Pennsylvania officer called his dispatcher.  According to Spaur, as the four officers stood and watched the UFO, which had stopped and was hovering, there was traffic on the radio about jets being scrambled to chase the UFO, and ""... we could see these planes coming in.When they started talking about fighter planes, it was just as if that thing heard every word that was said. It went PSSSSSHHEW, straight up, and I mean when it went up, friend, it didn\'t play no games, it went straight up.”  (Transcript of taped interview with Dale Spaur).  The Air Force ""identified"" the UFO as a satellite, seen part of the time, and confused with the planet Venus.  Under pressure from Ohio officials, Major Hector Quintanilla, chief of PROJECT BLUE BOOK, had an acrimonious confrontation with witnesses and refused to change the identification, although it was pointed out to him that they had seen the UFO in addition to Venus, and the moon at the conclusion of the observation. Major Quintanilla also denied that any jets had been scrambled.  William B. Weitzel conducted an exhaustive investigation on behalf of the NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE ON AERIAL PHENOMENA (NICAP), obtaining taped interviews, signed statements, sketches, and all pertinent data which was assembled into a massive report that was made available to congressional investigators.   When the UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO UFO PROJECT was initiated in 1966, a copy of Weitzel’s report was hand-delivered to the director, Dr. Edward U. CONDON, for his consideration. The CONDON REPORT, published two years later, does not mention the case.

This dramatic close encounter is regarded as being among the most persuasive arguments for the extraterrestrial hypothesis, and it is almost certainly the most solidly unidentifiable report from Massachusetts in the sixties.THE EVENTS:The events of that evening began to unfold shortly after 9:00 p.m.. Nancy Modugno, age 11, was laying in bed when she noticed a bright light blinking through her window. She looked out and saw, only forty feet away, an amazing object about the size of an automobile, brightly lit with flashing blue, green, red and white lights. The football-shaped craft made a whizzing, ricocheting sound as it moved over the neighborhood at a very low altitude, just clearing the tops of the houses. As she watched, the thing descended and could be seen behind trees, apparently landing in a large field behind Beverly High School. Terrified, the astonished girl ran down the stairs and tried to tell her father about what she had seen. He tried to calm her down and went about adjusting the television set, which had mysteriously just lost its picture. Nancy\'s mother, Claire, was visiting two friends, Barbara Smith and Brenda Maria, in an adjoining apartment at the time. Nancy\'s father ordered her back to bed, but she became hysterical and refused to leave. At this point, Barbara and Brenda walked in to order a pizza. Seeing Nancy in a fit, the two women attempted to ease her fears and calm her down. They could see the flashing lights in the field, and told Nancy that they would walk over there to prove that it was just a plane. Barbara and Brenda picked up Claire Modugno and walked down a hill to the field. The three women looked up and saw something they could not have anticipated. There were three objects maneuvering in the sky, halting and circling as if they were playing tag. They were oval-shaped, with bright flashing lights. Two were distant, but one was much closer, apparently right over the school. The women crossed the field to get a better look. They could see flashing lights on the edge of the craft changing colors from red to green and blue. Brenda waved her arms at the object and it immediately stopped circling and moved across the field towards the women. They were horrified. In her statement, Barbara said: ""It started to come towards us... I started to run. Brenda called, \'Look up! It is directly over us!\' I looked up and saw a round object... like the bottom of a plate. It was solid, grayish white... I felt this thing was going to come down on top of me. It was like a giant mushroom.""Out of sheer terror, Barbara and Claire turned and ran up the hill. Brenda was all alone in the field, with the thing only 20 feet above her head. She stated: ""The object appeared larger and larger as it came closer. The lights appeared to be all around and turning. The colors were very bright. When overhead, all I could see was a blurry atmosphere and brightly lit-up lights flashing slowly around... I thought it might crash on my head!""The others called to her, then she too turned and fled. One of the witnesses was so petrified by the encounter that she literally wet her pants. While the women ran back to the apartments, the object smoothly moved over the school building. They got on the telephone to alert their neighbors to the spectacle unfolding outside. One woman was already in her yard, watching the flying saucers. And one man, upon looking outside and seeing the discs, called the police. The police arrived to find a small crowd of people standing outside watching the closest object moving up and down above the school. Jokingly, Officers Bossie and Mahan asked the group, ""Where\'s the airplane?"" When the witnesses pointed to the thing, then at high altitude and looking like a star, the officers laughed. Then, suddenly, the disc turned bright red and dropped to a position directly over the school building. At this point, the officers became visibly shaken. Mahan stated, ""I observed what seem to be a large plate hovering over the school. It had three lights - red, green, and blue - but no noise... This object hovered... The lights were flashing..."" Bossie said, ""It hovered and then began gliding. Some of the people got on the ground and were real scared!"" They jumped back into the cruiser and drove toward the object, down into the schoolyard. They could see clearly that it was not an airplane or helicopter and that it was shaped like a half dollar, with three lights, red, green & blue, in indentations at the rear of the disc - similar to back-up lights. Just as the policemen got out of the cruiser, the disc made a couple of passes over the school and began to move slowly away. It picked up speed and was last seen as it disappeared behind buildings. By this time, the two other UFOs had also disappeared, though nobody had seen them leave. source:""UFOS: Interplanetary visitors"", book by Ramond E. Fowler, 1974, pp. 130-137. ', 'June, 1966-UFO incident, Nha Trang, South VietnamSoldier Relates 1966 sighting, VIETNAM UFO INCIDENT UNCOVERED. Caught up in the war around them, American GIs stationed in South Vietnam in June 1966 rarely had reason to speculate about UFOs -- at least until the little-known Nha Trang UFO incident took place. The Nha Trang incident if thorough documentation can be obtained, could become a UFO ""classic"" according to one NICAP investigator familiar with the case. The sighting allegedly occurred during one of the most active periods of the Vietnam conflict, and understandably received little publicity at the time. Now, however, with American participation in the war concluded, numerous war-related incidents are beginning to emerge. One of these involves a startling UFO sighting witnessed by possibly thousands of soldiers stationed in Vietnam at the time. NICAP investigator Raymond Fowler conducted an initial investigation into the sighting and was able to contact an eyewitness to the event. Nha Trang, at the time of the reported incident, was a heavily defended base in South Vietnam located along the coastline, which has now become an important area of tourism in Vietnam and that nowadays, specifically in this area, many Nha Trang hotels and guide tours are now available for tourists. But in 1966, it served as the home base for more than 40,000 troops, including 2,000 American GIs.The base was situated in a valley, with warehouses and an airstrip to the east, a fuel storage area and hills to the west, and docks and storage facilities located to the south along the China Sea. According to the witness, eight bulldozers were operating that night cutting roads around ""Hawk Hill,"" located less than one-half mile to the west of the American compound. On another part of the base, two ""sky-Raider"" prop-driven aircraft were warming up on the airstrip located less than a mile to the east. At the same time, a Shell Oil tanker lay anchored in the bay about a mile to the southwest. The witness, an enlisted soldier holding the rank of Specialist 5, had gathered with an undetermined number of fellow soldiers around 8 p.m. in an open area of the base to watch an outdoor movie. Outdoor films had become possible only recently, according to the witness, thanks to the arrival and installation of six, new, independently-operated, 100 KW diesel-powered generators. One of these generators had been installed near the compound where the soldiers were seated and was being used to supply power for the movie projector. The film had been underway for some time, according to the witness\'s account, when suddenly, at approximately 9:45 p.m., the sky to the north lit up! The GIs glanced up and saw what at first appeared to be a flare exploding above a ridge to the north. ""At first we thought it was a flare which are going off all the time and then we found that it wasn\'t"" recounts a letter from the witness mailed home a few days later. ""It came from the north and was moving from real slow to real fast...Some of the jet fighter pilots which were here...said it looked to be about 25,000 feet (in altitude)... then the panic broke loose. It dropped right towards us and stopped dead still about 300 to 500 feet up. It made this little valley and the mountains around look like it was the middle of the day; it lit up everything. ""Then it went up and I mean up. It went straight up and completely out of sight in about 2-3 seconds. Everybody is still talking about it."" Had the soldier\'s letter or his recent account of the incident stopped there, the case would probably not have come to the attention of either NICAP or the officials from Washington that reportedly visited the base the next day. But the letter and the witness\'s account of the incident continues: ""That really shook everyone is that it stopped, or maybe it didn\'t, but anyway our generator stopped and everything was black. At the Air Force Base about one half mile from here all generators stopped. The engines on two planes that were the runway ready to take off stopped, and there wasn\'t a car, truck, plane or anything that ran for about four minutes."" In addition, the eight bulldozers working on nearby hills also ceased operating according to the witness. ""A whole plane load of big shots from Washington got here this afternoon to investigate. It\'s on the radio over here. Is it at home? I swear if somebody says they saw a little green man I won\'t argue with them."" ""Little green man"" or not, the case could prove to be highly significant, despite the current lack of additional information. Compounding this problem is the witness\'s inability to recall anything more than the nicknames of those he was serving with at Nha Trang. Of extreme interest to NICAP, and apparently of equal interest to the ""big shots"" from Washington,"" was the associated EM effects reportedly caused by the strange UFO. The fact that diesel and gasoline engines scattered throughout the base all ceased to operate at the same time and remained inoperative for more than four minutes provides added mystery to the event. Included in the list of engines that ceased running at the time of the sighting, according to the witness, were those of the two ""Sky Raiders"" warming up on the nearby runway. One can only speculate what might have happened had they suffered a power loss while airborne. NICAP is currently attempting to contact appropriate Army officials in an effort to obtain the names of other enlisted or officer personnel who might have witnessed the event. NICAP is also seeking to determine whether officials from Washington did in fact visit Nha Trang the next day to investigate the sighting. source:www.nicap.org', 'The Great Michigan UFO Chase of 1966On a quiet day in March, 1966, seven eyewitnesses reported an unidentified flying object maneuvering over Livingston and Washtenaw counties. Ordinarily, these reports might have been dismissed by officials as the work of cranks. But this time, the seven witnesses WERE officials -- police officers and sheriff\'s deputies from the two counties. And their stories were backed up by more than 100 witnesses, including William Van Horn, a civil defense director, and dozens of students who watched the football-shaped object for four hours as it maneuvered near the University of Michigan campus, a nearby airport and a local swamp. The March 14 sightings caused an uproar and the area went on a wild UFO chase. Three days later on March 17 two Washtenaw County sheriff\'s deputies, Sgt. Neil Schneider and Deputy David Fitzpatrick saw three or four red, white and green circular objects oscillating and glowing near Milan about 4 a.m. They called Willow Run Airport officials who could not confirm with radar. Two more Washtenaw deputies, BuFord Bushroe and John Foster tried to follow the same type of objects in the northern part of the county on March 20. Livingston and Monroe county residents also reported seeing the objects.  The Detroit News carried the police chase story the next day along with a drawing of a quilted football shaped object with lights, dome and antennae. (It was not maize and blue with a big M on it.) Dexter patrolman Robert Huniwell said he spotted an object in the sky at Quigley and Brand roads between 9:30 and 9:45 PM.  He said the flying object with red and green flashing lights, came close to the ground, hovered above a scout car and was joined by a second vehicle on its ascent. Washtenaw County Sheriff Douglas Harvey ordered all available deputies to the scene. Six patrol cars, two men in each, and three detectives surrounded the area. They later chased a flying object along Island Lake Road without catching it. Frank Mannor and his family saw the lights from their McGuiness Road farm. ""I got within 500 yards of that thing and it looked pyramid-shaped. It had a light here and a light there and what looked like a porthole. ""It wasn\'t like the pictures of a flying saucer and it had a coral-like surface. I\'ve trapped every hole in this county and I\'ve never seen anything like it."" Mannor said the vehicle, by its own lights, appeared to be the length of a car and had a hazy mist under it as it hung above the ground. Mannor\'s son, a member of the Dexter High School track team, and Mannor\'s wife also witnessed the object. It rose up to the tree tops and waited awhile and fell back to the ground. It became different colors, white on the ground, blue, then red in the trees, and then came down and changed colors again. It sounded like a ricochet of a bullet, and like a siren, a real high frequency, they said.  Police Chief Robert R. Taylor and Patrolman N.G. Lee came to the farm in response to Mrs. Mannor\'s call and heard the noise. ""I thought it was an ambulance,"" Lee said. The chief\'s son, Robert, 16, also saw the red vehicle in the sky at about 10:30 p.m. ""It was going on in the east pretty slow, and then it sped up and went west,"" he said. ""It was flashing red and white.""   Washtenaw County Deputy Sheriff BuFord Bushroe also observed it. ""It looked like an arc. It was round. We turned around and started following it through Dexter for five miles. It was headed west and we stopped. We lost it in the trees. Either the lights went off or it took off with a tremendous burst of speed. It was about 1,500 feet above the ground. It moved along at about 100 mph. We were doing 70 before losing it near Wylie Road."" Carloads of college students from nearby University of Michigan and Eastern Michigan University converged on the area after hearing radio reports of the sightings. Mannor was asked if it could have been a college prank. He vigorously denied the possibility. ""They couldn\'t rig rigging to it. There was not anything there, There was no way in the world to get out. There were two scout cars on the hill and more at the house.""  ""I know every pothole in this county,"" he said. ""I\'ve never seen anything like it. There\'s nothing wrong with my eyes and my son has 20/20 vision. We both can\'t be wrong.""    ""My wife says we\'ll move out of here,"" he said. ""She doesn\'t like that. I never lock the doors. Nobody ever bothers us.""  An Adrian College professor offered the theory that northern lights may be the objects the deputies tried to chase.   On March 22 dozens of residents of Dexter and Hillsdale reported more flying objects emitting strange sounds and lights.  On March 23 a teen from Monroe said he took photos, which looked like a big black blob.   The Air Force sent in Blue Book astronomer and UFO expert Dr. J. Allen Hynek who, after a whirlwind probe that lasted two hours and 45 minutes, dismissed the sightings as ""swamp gas.""  Hynek quoted a description of marsh gases by Dutch astronomer Minnaert: ""The lights resemble tiny flames, sometimes seen right on the ground, sometimes merely floating above it. ""The flames go out in one place and suddenly appear in another, giving the illusion of motion. The colors are sometimes yellow, sometimes red and bluegreen."" ""Marsh gas,"" Hynek said, ""usually has no smell, but sounds like the small popping explosions similar to a gas burner igniting. The gas forms from decomposition of vegetation. It seems likely that as the present spring thaws came, the gases methane, hydrogen sulfide and phosphine, resulting from decomposition of organic materials, were released.""       He also said youths playing ""pranks with flares"" added to the excitement. He dismissed a photo taken March 17 as a time exposure of the moon and Venus.       Van Horn, a Hillsdale native who grew up on the edge of a swamp, was outraged by Hynek\'s findings, asserting that he knew more about swamp gas than Hynek did. He said Hynek ignored his reports that the lights moved and that there was a convex surface between the lights. A fake photo was taken by Air Force investigator Maj. Raymond Nyls in March 1967 in an attempt to duplicate a photo taken by brothers Grant and Dan Jaroslaw of Harrison Twp. The UFO is actually a block of wood hanging by a string from a children\'s swing set.       Van Horn, a pilot with a commercial rating, objected to the treatment of what came to be known as ""the Michigan affair"" by the Air Force, charging that ""a lot of good people are being ridiculed.""       Hynek replied that he still believed that marsh gas was the logical explanation for these sightings.       Sightings of UFOs in the area continued, but these apparent copycat incidents seemed obviously fake. A Grand Haven man who reported a UFO landing near his home was not believed.  Eastern Michigan University Police Chief John E. Hayes examines a Yipsilanti UFO that turned out to be a dry cleaning bag with a plastic cross on the open bottom holding several small candles.         On March 29 more sightings were reported over Michigan. Some from Macomb and Oakland counties, others from Bad Axe, Flint and Ann Arbor. Viewers included Richard Sober of Ann Arbor, an off-duty sheriff\'s deputy, and Police Chief Ford Wallace of Linden.       In Washington the government was urged to release all information on the sightings.       In April Frankfort and Marquette joined in with sightings. The Frankfort sighting was identified as a marine flare.       The next year brothers Grant and Dan Jaroslaw of Harrison Twp, took photos of objects they claimed were flying over Lake St. Clair. A lie detector test failed to back up their story.       Hynek returned to Hillsdale but stuck to his original swamp gas declaration.       There were a few more sightings in 1967 in Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, Ypsilanti and Grand Haven. In February four Ann Arbor residents reported objects flying in formation. And in Grand Haven police confirmed the sightings.       Not much came of all the commotion. However the popularity of reporting unusual stuff in the sky to officials kept Selfridge Air Force base busy. By 1968, they were receiving two or three reports of UFO sightings per week.', 'UFO CASEBOOK HOME PAGEWe shall call our experiencer Eve. Eve was only 12 years old when she had an eerie encounter with the unknown. She was living with her Aunt and her cousins in Gulfport, Mississippi during the summer (July) of 1966. Gulfport is only a short distance down the coast from Pascagoula, which would be host to the landmark 1973 abduction of Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker. At the bewitching age between childhood and adulthood, Eve would portray both roles this particular day. Playing in the back yard with her cousins, she began to feel a strange sensation... like something or someone was calling her, or watching her. She turned to look behind her, and was stunned by the sight of a craft in the distance. The craft had an array of colored lights, a pretty and alluring sight to a twelve-year-old girl. The lights were blinking on and off. They encircled the strange craft, and these lights seemed to be of a color she had not seen before, and were extremely bright and clear. In her own words, ""The more I looked, the more I wanted to keep looking."" Though the onset of the sighting had been unnerving, she now felt a strange sense of contentment. The sight of the beautifully colored lights made her happy. She could not take her eyes off the craft and its twinkling lights. The sighting had interrupted the children\'s game of ""hide and seek."" Eve was ""it,"" and since she was taking too long to find anyone, the others began to call for her. Eve could hear their cries, but she could not respond to their pleas. She was so strongly drawn to the craft, it was if she was glued to its presence... its charm. The importance of her game was now insignificant compared to the strange object that had her mesmerized. Finally one of the impatient children found her and tapped her on the shoulder to get her attention. This jolted her back to reality, and she was then able to move. Eve was asked, ""Why weren\'t you trying to find us?"" She responded, ""I don\'t know, but isn\'t it pretty?"" still drawn to the object.She had not even turned toward her playmate, the craft still holding her attention. Eve pointed to the hovering, distant object. She said, ""Look at that!"" Her friend asked, ""What is it?"" The rest of the ""hide and seek"" gang was now on the scene, staring at the UFO. Mostly frightened, they wanted to leave, afraid it would ""get them."" One of the kids told Eve to come inside, but Eve refused, wanting to continue her watch. Being warned that she might get into trouble by being outside after dark, Eve had watched her friends run to the back door, and then as she turned back to get one more look at the craft, she noticed it was much closer now. She could see two beings inside through a window! She could make out part of one of their bodies, and another being seemed to be controlling the UFO. The two appeared to be conversing with each other. Eve felt as if they were talking about her, the lone person drawn to their presence. Both of the beings had long, slender arms, and the pilot of the object seemed to be focusing on Eve now. Her happiness was beginning to turn into fright and she began running. She fled not in the direction of her house, but toward some bushes near the house. She was trying to lure the object\'s attention away from her family inside the house. The UFO moved even closer to the ground now. Eve could hear no sound, but felt she was being targeted. In her frantic run for safety, she looked back to see where the house-sized object was. A white beam was now projected from the bottom of the object, obviously searching for Eve. She made it to the bushes before the beam could find her. She was now kneeling, shaking, and crying to herself. She prayed for God to help her, as the craft edged even closer to her hiding place. ""Had the craft found her?"" she asked herself. The beam was moving...scanning the ground close to her. The object was totally motionless as the beam angled toward the ground. Soon the light disappeared up into the craft, not turned off, but drawn into the craft in one motion. Within a moment, the craft was gone. She could barely make it out and it rose further into the sky. There were now three other craft just like the first one she saw. Eve could sense they were working in unison. The four craft were now moving slowly. Should she make a run for the house? No, not yet. Oh no! Another craft now filled the place of the first one, and began searching the ground around the house and the bushes. After a few short moments, the beam was drawn back into the craft just like the first one had been. The second search craft now reunited with the remaining three. After what Eve estimated as some 20 seconds, the objects made a type of jerking motion, and in flash, they were gone. This was her chance. She ran for the house, and tried to open the screen door. It was locked. She couldn\'t believe she was locked out of her own house, and she began banging on the door, shaking the screen door, making all the noise she could. ""Where was everybody?"" she thought. She called to her Aunt, who eventually came to the back door in her bed clothes. She asked Eve, ""Who are you?"" Eve said, ""It\'s me."" Her Aunt asked her what she was doing out so late. Eve told her that her cousins had just came in a few minutes before. Her Aunt\'s reply shocked her, ""Everyone has been in bed for a while.""Her Aunt explained that she remembered Eve was in the house when she locked the doors. Eve went to her and her cousin\'s bedroom, and woke her cousin to ask her what had happened. Her cousin also stated that she thought Eve was safe inside the house with the others before the doors were locked. The strange UFO and its occupants are gone now, but Eve\'s haunting memories are not. She, to this day, does not understand what exactly occurred or why. She turned her story in to one UFO investigative group, but no follow-up was done, and she was basically ignored. The case was not recent enough, she was told. The significance of what happened to Eve is not diminished by the passing of time. It is as important today as it was then. Did Eve go into the house as the others claimed? Was she then abducted by the occupants of the UFO? Eve was too afraid and traumatized at the time to tell anyone what happened that summer night in Mississippi. Eve now wants to tell her story. Who will listen? article by B J Booth, as told to him by Eve Map supplied by Mapquest', 'UFO Encountered, Photographed, Roaring River, Missouri, 1966This case is unique in Ufology for several reasons. Although there have been a number of eyewitness accounts of UFOs shooting beams either to the ground or at someone (Travis Walton) the case from Roaring River, Missouri has eyewitness testimony of personal items being destroyed by a beam or some other weapon from a UFO. The UFO, in this case, was seen and photographed.On November 22, 1966, the events of Roaring River, Missouri. The exact location was near Cassville. During deer season, two hunters were trying their luck. As one of the men returned to their campsite, he became alarmed when he saw smoke rising from their camp. He immediately ran to find out what had happened. He discovered the hunters\' 12""X18\' tent and other equipment totally destroyed. The tent was still smoldering.Also some shoes and records were still smoking. One of the aluminum poles that supported the tent was singed, but not burned. The aluminum cots inside their tent were melted. Oddly, the hunters\' tent was set up under two trees, and being winter time, the leaves of the tree were dried; the leaves showed no damage at all, indicating that the destructive force was a narrow beam.About 15 feet away was a dead tree with the top still burning. The witness then heard a low humming sound, and looking for the source, he saw an unusual object rising from the valley just beyond the burning tree. He was able to photograph the object only a few seconds after it left the ground, and managed a second photo a few seconds later. The entire sighting was no more than 20 seconds.The humming sound coming from the UFO intensified as it picked up speed. His last look at the object put it about 40 degrees above the horizon. It was gaining speed as it left. The UFO was of an aluminum color, reflecting the sunlight. Also, the witness saw what to him appeared to be a band around the the center of the object.The UFO flew effortlessly as it moved into the skies. The witness walked the distance from his location to the area of the object, measuring approximately 300 feet. The object\'s diameter was estimated at 25 feet, being about 8 feet thick.The hunter had used a 620 format Argoflex camera with a coated varex 75mm, f/4.5 lens, shutter speed at 1/90 seconds, f/8 depth of field if focused at infinity was 41 feet to infinity. The two photographs were in the center of the roll with other camping exposures at beginning and end of roll. There can be little doubt that the damage at the campsite was done by the UFO photographed by the hunter.(B J Booth)', 'The Tully Saucer NestAt 9:00 am on January 19, 1966, a calm sunny day, a 28 year old banana farmer named George Pedley was driving a tractor near Horseshoe Lagoon on the property of Albert Pennisi, near Tully, in tropical far north Queensland, Australia. When he was about 25 yards from the lagoon, he heard a loud hissing sound above the noise of the tractor. Suddenly, an object rose out of the swamp. When I glanced at it, it was already 30 feet above the ground, and at about tree-top level. It was a large, grey, saucer-shaped object, convex on the top and bottom and measured some 25 feet across and 9 feet high. While I watched, it rose another 30 feet, spinning very fast, then it made a shallow dive and took off with tremendous speed. Climbing at an angle of 45 degrees it disappeared within seconds in a south-westerly direction... Another surprise came when Pedley rounded the bend of the road and came to the spot from which the object had risen. There in the lagoon was a large circular area that was clear of reeds and in which the water was rotating slowly. It had not been like that three hours earlier when he had passed the lagoon. After looking around, he got back on the tractor and left. A few hours later, at about noon, Pedley returned to the lagoon for a second look. The scene had changed, because now the circular area was covered by a floating mass of green reeds that were distributed in a clockwise radial pattern. The circular mass of reeds was about 30 feet in diameter. Pedley was by now excited enough about what he was seeing to go and tell Albert Pennisi, the owner of the sugar cane farm land on which the lagoon was located, and another friend. Pennesi recalled that his dog had acted strangely that morning, barking madly and heading off toward the lagoon at about 5:30 am. Pennisi and the other man were amazed by the circular mass of reeds. Wading out to the mass, they found that they could swim under the mass of reeds and that the lagoon floor beneath it was smooth and showed no traces of roots. Oddly, the outside edges of the mass of reeds angled down, similar to the shape of a saucer placed face down. Pennisi went and got his camera and took photographs of the mass of reeds, which was now beginning to turn brown on its top surface. George Pedley reported his experience to the Tully police that evening, and they in turn reported it to the RAAF after making a trip to the site the next day, January 20. Within days, the media had picked up the event and the area was filled with investigators, many of whom were trying to prove theories as to the cause of the ""nest"" such as helicopters, big birds, crocodiles, reed-eating grubs, and whirlwinds of one sort or another. Pedley\'s UFO sighting was all but overlooked in the flurry of explanations. During the course of the investigations, as many as five other ""nests"", all smaller than the original, were discovered. In some of these, the reeds were rotated in a counter-clockwise direction and a couple of them showed signs of burning in the center of the nest. Samples of the original nest were sent to Brisbane for analysis, but nothing unusual was detected. Other than being part of the ""nest"", the only unusual thing about the reeds was that they turned brown in about 8 hours, whereas reeds uprooted by hand in the lagoon took three days to turn brown. In another unusual twist, Albert Pennisi told a reporter from the Sydney, Australia newspaper The Sun that he had been dreaming about a UFO landing on his property for a week: I\'d get them almost every night. And they were beginning to worry me. I couldn\'t understand them. It was always the same. This thing like a giant dish would come out of nowhere and land nearby. And I would watch it in my dream and get real afraid before it went away. Then on Wednesday morning about 5 o\'clock my dog suddenly seemed to go out of its mind. It was howling like a mad thing and raced off towards the lagoon. What happened at Horseshoe Lagoon? There was never any evidence that there were any helicopters in the area nor any demonstrated reason for one to be over the lagoon. There was no evidence that crocodiles made the nest and analysis of the reeds from the nest showed no trace of ""reed-eating grubs."" There was no known bird that would or could make such a nest in three hours. The best explanation that the RAAF could offer was that the nest was created by a willy willy, a type of small whirlwind known to occur in the area. Although a conclusive determination could not be made, the most probable explatation was that the sighting was of a ""willy willy"" or circular wind phenomenon which flattened the reeds and sucked up debris to a height of about 30 feet, thus forming what appeared to be a ""flying saucer"", before moving off and dissipating. Hissing noises are known to be associated with ""willy willies"" and the theory is also substantiated by the clockwise configuration of the depression. However, such whirlwinds, except when they occur in the desert as dust devils, normally accompany thunderstorms, and although the Tully event occurred during the rainy season, January 19 was a sunny day with little or no wind. Pedley described what he saw as a blue-grey object shaped like two saucers face to face. This description doesn\'t sound like a whirling mass of swamp debris, and there was no fallen debris in the area where the dissipation would have occurred. Finally, how does the whirlwind explanation account for the fact that the water was clear when Pedley looked the first time, yet was covered by the mass of reeds when he looked again three hours later? ', '1966, USS TIRU Encounters UFOThe question is often asked, why don\'t more military UFOwitnesses come forward publicly, and provide names, datesand places? Surely they aren\'t REALLY intimidated by suchempty threats as JANAP 146-E, which provides for hefty finesand jail sentences for breaking silence on a military UFOsighting. Surely they realize the scientific import oftheir sighting transcends any nationalist or mili- taryconsiderations. If more military witnesses don\'t come forthpublicly, isn\'t it possible that there aren\'t really as manyas hardcore ufologists would have us believe? Its a questionI\'ve often asked myself.ParaNet is deeply indebted to, and a little honored by, user BillCooper of Fullerton, California, for this, the first known reportof a multiple military witness sighting that occurred onboard thesubmarine USS Tiru in 1966.                             Jim SpeiserIn 1966 during the month of the Rose Festival in the Pacific Northwest United States, the USS Tiru SS-416 left Pearl Harbor bound for Seattle Washington.  The sub moored to a civilian pier near the downtown Seattle area and thousands of people toured the sub during its stay in Seattle.  After its duty as ""showboat"" it proceeded to a back bay area where it underwent torpedo trials.  I believe the area was called Dabob bay [pronounced day-bob] but I am not sure of the spelling.  I include the above information because it  should be easy to research.  During the cruise from Pearl  to Seattle five of the crew had a very unusual experience. During one late afternoon the sub was cruising on the surface at approx. 10 knots when the port lookout reported a strange contact at a range of 2 miles bearing 315 degrees relative.  The lookout refused to tell the OOD what it was that he had seen and instead insisted that the starboard lookout and the OOD both look at that area.  The three men looked through their binoculars toward the area reported and were astounded to see a metal craft larger than a football field tumble from the clouds into the ocean.  It actually tumbled end over end and when it hit the water and sank beneath the ocean huge geysers of water rose into the air.  When the port lookout was sure that the others had seen it he then told the OOD that he had seen it tumble from the ocean up into the clouds.  The OOD and the starboard lookout were speechless.  Within a few minutes, however, they all became excited when it again rose from the water and tumbled up into the cloud layer.  At about the same time a crew member below queried the bridge about a radar contact at the same range and bearing.  Sonar also reported strange echos.  The OOD called for the Captain to come to the bridge at that time. He also called for the camera to be sent to the bridge.  The Captain arrived on the bridge within 2 minutes and the Chief Quartermaster was right behind him with the camera. At about the same time the object emerged from the clouds and fell down into the ocean.  All five men witnessed this.  The QMC took pictures as it rose up into the clouds and then back down into the ocean once again.  The five men watched for quite a while longer but nothing else happened.  Soon the sub had moved out of visual range and the Captain told all witnesses that they were never to discuss what they had seen with anyone under any circumstances.  He stated that the incident was classified information.  The Captain then went below and sent a radio msg.  There was no doubt as to what we had seen.  It was a metal craft with machinery on and around the outside of it.  It appeared to have windows or lenses placed around its perimeter.  It made no noise that we could hear.  It did not disturb the subs electrical systems nor did it affect the gyro compass.  It looked very much like a round flying ""ship"" as in sea going ship.  It had the shape and form of a saucer with a bowl inverted in the saucer and it was huge.  I will never forget it as long as I live. When I first saw this craft I believe that my heart literally stopped beating and I was terrified.  The name of the OOD was Ensign Ball.  The starboard lookout was an American Indian seaman that the crew called Geronimo. The port lookout was a new man who left the sub soon after the return to Pearl Harbor and his name was Cooper.  I do not remember the Captain\'s name nor the Chief Quartermaster\'s name.  This is the first time I have ever mentioned it since the moment that the Captain told me that it was classified. As far as I know it has never been reported to the public before this instant.  It should be easy to verify the facts if you can get a copy of the log and/or contact the other witnesses.  The names should not be too hard to find in the ship\'s records/logs.  I was the port lookout.  I must say that I feel a great uneasiness in posting this, much like the way I felt in Vietnam when my life was in great danger. ', ""Near Vicksburg, Michigan; March 31, 1966-Disc-Shaped ObjectEarly on the morning of March 31, Jeno Udvardy, a 1956 Hungarian refugee, was driving home from a late work shift near Vicksburg, Michigan. When he reached the crest of a hill he saw a cluster of lights on the road ahead which he assumed was an ambulance at an accident. He slowed and approached cautiously. When within about 10 feet of the lights, he suddenly realized that they were not on any recognizable vehicle. Instead they were seen to be on a disc-shaped object hovering a few feet above the road and blocking his passage. Brilliant lights from the object, some steady and some blinking, concealed some details of the object. (See sketch). Udvardy became frightened and tried to back away from the strange object. At that moment his car was buffeted violently as if by strong gusts of wind. Then he saw what he first thought was another object hovering behind his car, but a quick glance ahead slowed that the object was no longer on the road ahead. Apparently it had darted overhead and taken a new position behind him. The same pattern of lights was visible on the object. Udvardy then realized that his motor had stalled. (It is not known whether this was due to electro-magnetic interference as reported in many cases, but he could easily have stalled the car in the excitement of the moment). He rolled down his window and looked out. For the first time he heard a low humming sound like a swarm of bees. Moments later, the UFO rose abruptly and sped off at a steep angle, disappearing in the eastern sky. Having experienced Communist terrorism and other violence in his native country, Udvardy told the NICAP investigator, he did not scare easily. But this encounter with something unknown had shaken him. The incident probably lasted less than a minute, but, for many minutes Udvardy sat in the car regaining his composure before he was able to drive home. At his wife's urging he reported the experience to the Kalamazoo Sheriff's office. He later became somewhat bitter over the ridicule his report evoked. However, he stuck to his story in the face of skepticism though he had nothing to gain from it. source:http://www.nicap.org/newlook/section_VI.htm"", 'Washington, D.C., August 1, 1966-Oblong Object Descends over House On July 31 and August 1, 1966, there was a flurry of sightings in the general area of Washington and Baltimore. Prince Georges County police watched lighted objects maneuvering erratically across the sky. In Baltimore, residents of the Country Ridge housing development were awakened early in the morning of August 1 by barking dogs. At least two families saw a hovering, egg-shaped object with flashing lights on the top and bottom. The object made a loud whirring or whining noise, according to the Baltimore News-American (8/1). That night, physicist Vasil Uzunoglu, a consultant on micro-electronics, was driving north and east on the Capital (Washington, D.C.) Beltway about 10:55 p.m. (EDT). He had passed Andrews Air Force Base when, out of his open left window, he saw a light descend and appear to hover briefly, then move rapidly to the east. Minutes later an oblong object ""like a submarine"" descended over a house to his left. This time the UFO was much closer, its apparent size as large as the house. Dr. Uzunoglu slowed his car and looked at the object, now an estimated 200 feet away, for about ten seconds. At this point it showed details of structure: a peaked top with a red light; an apparently rounded undersurface with red lights; and a large yellow revolving light slightly off-center. ""I could see clearly the top of the body, which was a dark, non-shining material with no sharp edges,"" he told NICAP. ""The most striking part was the eye-like object off-center to the right, with two distinct yellow regions. . . (The lower region) was revolving, blinking or scanning. . . "" Dr. Uzunoglu turned his attention to the highway again, noting that no other cars were in sight. When he glanced back again, the object was moving south ""at a very high speed and comparatively low elevation."" He said it disappeared in seconds. source:http://www.nicap.org/newlook/section_IV.htm', 'Yorktown, Iowa; April 23, 1966-Cigar-shaped object lands  At 2:10 a.m. on the morning of April 23, Ronald E. Johnson, a farmer living on Route #2 in Yorktown, a few miles west of Clarinda, Iowa, was awakened by a loud roar. On getting up and going to his window, which faced south, he saw a cigar-shaped object, approximately 60 feet in length, landing in a field within 50 feet of his house. The object, which had apparently come out of the north, came into view as it moved over the house. The night was foggy and a light rain was falling at the time. No moon or stars were visible. The roar of the object ceased as it landed. On the end of the object closest to the, house, Johnson saw a brilliant red light, which bathed the area in a ""blood red"" glow. On the farthest end, he saw two blue lights approximately eight inches in diameter, which extended above the body of the object. The surface of the object was of a dull finish, except for an amber glow that extended partway along the bottom. The object rested on a series of from 17 to 20 long ""legs."" After landing, the object gave off a series of loud, explosive, ""cracking"" noises, like gunshots, at regular intervals. Johnson said the air was filled with an odor which he described as similar to ozone. He saw nothing leaving or entering the object. He watched it sitting motionless in his field for about 20 minutes and finally went back to bed. He got up a short time later to see if it was still there, but it had either departed silently, or had turned out its lights. The explosive sounds were no longer heard. In the morning, Johnson discovered that sometime during the night his livestock had all bolted to the far end of the pasture and appeared to be ""acting up considerably."" They would not return for feeding that morning. Examining the landing site he found a series of circular impressions six inches in diameter and spaced alternately in two rows. The distance between impressions was two and a half feet. To the east of the landing impressions he found a second set of imprints, round on one side and square-edged on the other, and divided at the squared-off edge into three sections (see diagram). These impressions were not made by his cattle, according to the farmer. One other peculiar detail was noticed: two power line poles appeared to have fresh depressions in the wood at regular intervals, as if it had been recently climbed. The poles were smeared with dirt. Wires rising on the poles had small, regular-spaced notches. Johnson reported the incident to Deputy Sheriff Dick Hunt, who made an investigation. A complete report was said to have been sent to Offut Air Force base; however, Johnson was not queried by any official investigators, and if the report is among those in the official files, it was not released to the University of Colorado, who requested information on it in July, 1967. Additional details were obtained for NICAP by member Dennis Hicks. source:http://www.nicap.org/newlook/section_VI.htm']"

The area below him was illuminated for about 10 seconds by incandescent light and it was certainly not a light from another plane.""Three other aircraft saw it moving at a high speed or static. However, air traffic control were informed and they confirmed that there were no other planes in the vicinity.""Then, five minutes later, there was a brief radar return from a spot 75 miles away. We believe there was no danger involved.""The Luton-based 96-seater plane was flying company executives from Linkoping, Sweden, to Humberside airport. A spokesman for Debonair, which runs cut-price flights throughout Europe, said chief executive Franco Mancassola had been informed that a ""great red light in the sky"" had been spotted near one of the company\'s planes.At one stage, the report says, the object came to an abrupt halt before accelerating past the airliner at thousands of miles an hour.A CAA source says the object was tracked by a military radar station in Yorkshire after it entered UK air space.A spokesman for the 6,000 member British Pilots Association said: ""We get reports of this nature from our members, but they are few and far between.""In the past 10 years or so I would say there have been around six cases of UFOs being sighted.""Many pilots are reluctant to make such claims because it tends to lay them open to ridicule.

They continued to watch as the object proceeded toward the herd until it succeeded in getting quite close to the animals. The animals apparently remained unaware of the objectís presence until it was within a very short distance of the herd. Suddenly, the animals bolted, most of the them running up the slope to their east. However, one adult animal was seen by the witnesses to separate itself from the herd and run or trot to generally to the north, perhaps along a logging road. The witnesses report that at this point, the object quickly moved directly above the lone elk and seemed to lift it off the ground, although no visible means of support of the animal was evident to the observers. The witnesses added that shortly after lifting the elk off the ground, the object seemed to begin to ""wobble"" to a more pronounced degree than it had exhibited earlier. In addition, as the object appeared to increase its altitude, the elk, which was suspended upright below the disc, rotated slowly beneath it and appeared to be getting closer to the ventral surface of the disc. They also commented that the object seemed to increase in size slightly after it had picked up the animal. With the elk suspended below it, the object began to ascend slowly up a clear-cut slope to the east. However, the witnesses watched it apparently brush the tops of nearby trees to the east, at which point it reversed its course and proceeded to the west. It executed a 360-degree turn to the left and may have gained some slight altitude in the process, the witnesses thought. After the object had completed its turn and was once again proceeding in a generally easterly direction, it began ascending very quickly at what seemed to the witnesses to be a rather steep angle. It continued to ascend, and simply disappeared from sight of the witnesses. The witnesses stated that once the object had started to ascend and had climbed to an altitude above their vantage point, they no longer could see the animal suspended below the craft. Their presumption was that the animal had somehow been taken into the craft, although the witnesses could discern no ""door,"" or any kind of aperture through which the animal might have been conveyed into the craft.The witnesses also stated that following the incident, the herd of elk remained in the same general area, although remained more closely huddled to one another than had been the case earlier in the morning. The workers added that they, too, had remained closer to one another until their departure from the area at the end of the work day.', 'Disc-shaped object: Elk abduction: Washington State, 02-25-1999Within seconds of their first observation of the object, the witnesses became aware that the object was travelling generally in the direction of a herd of elk that they had been watching all morning.

Those who saw the unknown object called it ""something with small wings"". Military officials would stick with the ""nothing at all"" explanation. Four different people claim to have seen an oblong object plunge into the waters of Backsjon. The object was described as about 15 feet long and about 4-5 feet wide. There was a definite splash as the object smacked into the lake, throwing water into the air. One witnesses contacted the rescue station in Arvika; they turned the inquiry back to local police, who made their report. Police Chief of Staff Stellan Jansson told the media that all witnesses of the event were interviewed.It would be the latter part of August that a full search of the lake began. Involved in the operation was the military, security police, and Arvika rescue personnel. Although witness statements were considered legitimate, the rescue teams soon discovered that a much more elaborate, and costly operation was needed. The lake was some 2 miles long, and a half mile wide.On the thirteenth day of September, ""Operation Sea Find"" began. The team this time was composed of 14 men, of which 8 were expert divers. Also employed was Sweden\'s most high tech sonar equipment along with under water photography. A cover-up scenario was the explanation give to local residents, claiming that the entire operation was a home defense exercise.Officials stated several different reasons for their operations; one was that robberies in governmental facilities had breached security, and missing items could have been dropped into the lake, and also that if the object was found to be foreign made, it could be some type of surveillance equipment related to the recent thefts in the area.Rescue operations ultimately claimed that nothing of significance was found; only a plastic bag and a metal barrel, dashing the hopes of locals who thought something exotic might be found. Jansson told the community that ten full days was given to the search, and though they were confident that something would be found, they came up empty.Jansson also stated that because of the size of the lake, to fully search the lake would have taken a year or more. But, he was satisfied that if something unusual was in the lake, his team would have found it. A final report of rescue results was sent to government headquarters in Stockholm on October 1, 1999. Two pages of the report were not classified, but transcripts of security Police interviews and a description of the methods used in the search were classified.UFO-Sweden filed a request to de-classify the secret documents, but as of this writing, their requests have gone unfulfilled. Although there are many unanswered questions about this case, there is no evidence to support the fact that a UFO crashed into Lake Backsjön.(B J Booth)reference:UFO Swedenhttp://home.supernet.com/~rfisher/carbondale.html', 'February 3, 1999, Jet Crew Tell Of Close Encounter With UFO UFO Mystery As Pilots See Red   An unidentified object described as ""a great red light in the sky"" and ""big as a battleship"" has caused consternation in the skies over the North Sea.   Pilots reported being buzzed by a ""long, cylindrical object"" at 28,000ft and one pilot and his crew described how the underside of their jet became bathed in an ""incandescent light"".   The Civil Aviation Authority has confirmed that a comprehensive report of the sightings has been handed in, although both it and the Ministry of Defence deny that they are investigating it.   The Luton-based plane, a Debonair BAe146, was flying company executives from Sweden to Humberside airport when, it is claimed, the object came to a sudden halt before speeding by the airliner in the incident on 3 February, 58 miles off the coast of Denmark.   I have today (5-4-99) obtained a copy of the official report by Debonair to the Civil Aviation Authority concerning the above sighting, which occurred on 3 February 1999.   The report was filed as ""a mandatory occurrence report"" and the CAA were taking no further action as ""there was no danger to the aircraft or passengers.""   A spokesman for Debonair said the pilot is currently on leave and a request has been put out for him to make a statement to the press when he returns.   It was added that the pilot assumed the lights beneath the jet were those of another aircraft at the time they were seen. She said the company had been ""snowed under"" with inquiries from the press about the sighting.   The Debonair report to the CAA report reads:   ""Unidentified bright light below BAe146 at FL280.   ""Area below a/c illuminated for 10 seconds by incandescent light which was not considered by reporter to be an a/c landing light.   Reporter stated three other a/c reported seeing it moving at high speed or static. ATC informed but they reported no other a/c in vicinity. Five minutes later a radar return was present at 75 miles on weather radar. Atmosphere reported as stable and no other a/c were in vicinity.""   The aircraft involved was a British Aerospace 146, a small four engined jet flying on a chartered flight from Linkoping in Sweden to Humberside Airport in East Yorkshire.   The UFO was reported whilst the aircraft was flying at 28,000 feet, 58 miles off the Danish coast above the North Sea. Tracey Law, of Humberside Airport, said the report was made by the pilot to the CAA on landing, but there was ""no mention made whatsoever of UFOs in the original report..it has since been embellished. It was not mentioned to us officially as it happened outside of our airspace.""   In particular she mentioned the description of the UFO as being ""as big as a battleship"" being manufactured by the press, Humberside Airport said they believed the sighting had been caused by ""a light reflection from the underside of the jet."" Flight Lieutenant Tom Rounds of the RAF at the Ministry of Defence, Whitehall, said the MOD had learned of the report via the Press.   He said stories that the object had been tracked by RAF radar were ""laughable"" as the UK radar could not pick up objects 58 miles off the Danish coast.   Flt Lieut Rounds said the MOD were not investigating the report, and had not received any report concerning it from the CAA.From David Clarke From UFO Updates,  updates@globalserve.net5-4-99Original story from The Evening Standard (London) 4-37-99', 'October 28, 1999-Abduction on Carlyle LakeCARLYLE LAKE, KEYSPORT -- During hypnosis of an October 28, 1999, abduction I was out boating on Carlyle Lake. I remembered the flight from the lake to the craft and getting a good view of our town from the air, and going through the floor of the UFO. The boat gradually moved over me and went through the bottom of the craft before I did. I did not get a good look of the UFO as I was concentrating on my boat and other possessions as we were brought through the floor. The next thing I recalled is standing inside the craft and seeing an examination table which was on a pedestal that almost reached the edge of the table. It was molded into the floor. There was some kind of structure over the table that looked like a light or some instruments. The room was rounded and I was guided to the table by a small gray. I remember getting up on the table as if I had done it before. At that moment, I discovered that my clothes were gone. Shortly there after a larger gray came up and put his face into mine and I felt he was sucking the memory out of me. I was okay afterward and left alone. I then tried to get to my clothes, but wound up back on the table. After I received some kind of examination, I again went to my clothes and the small grays helped me get them on. The next thing I remember is sitting in the boat and a ramp with a rounded front that opens up. The grays pushed me and the boat out some 750 feet above the northern portion of Carlyle Lake. I did not stay in the boat, but floated out.Afterwards, I just forgot the whole thing except the position change which was about one quarter of a mile and I was going in another direction. I have been able to determine that there were two abductions and one failed abduction before during the same year and have recalled parts of others with and without hypnosis. Two of the abductions and a failed abduction were recorded on a GPS and saved.  Thanks to Paul Lawson', 'UFO Landing Near Kirtland Air Force Base  Mystery Blonde Leaves Hair Behind -- But Who Was She? An abduction case from Australia has resulted in what may be the world\'s first DNA test of abduction-related biological material. The intriguing results raise many questions about the physical nature of abduction and also illustrate the need for more intensive scientific research on this worldwide mystery. The full case report by leading Australian researcher Bill Chalker was published in the Spring 1999 edition of International UFO Reporter, the quarterly journal of the Chicago-based J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). The following summary is published with Chalker\'s permission and assistance. Peter Khoury, the subject of this case, was born in Lebanon in 1964 and moved to Australia in 1973. There he met his future wife Vivian at school in 1981. Peter and Vivian were married in 1990 and now have two children. They live in Sydney. Peter works in the building trades and has owned his own business in cement rendering. Peter and Vivian had their first UFO experience in February 1988, a simple sighting of unusual moving lights. But in July of that year, Peter had a deeply disturbing, consciously remembered contact experience that, he says, changed his life. While lying on his bed, he felt something grab his ankles. He suddenly felt numb and paralyzed, but remained conscious. Then he noticed three or four small hooded figures alongside the bed. He experienced telepathic communication with one or more of these beings; he was told to relax and not be afraid because ""it would be like last time."" He then saw that they were about to insert a long needle into the side of his head, whereupon he blacked out. He jolted awake some time later, leaped out of bed and ran into the living room where he found his father and brother apparently dozing. Both he and his brother felt that only 10 minutes had passed since they had last been awake, but they soon realized that an hour or more had passed. The next morning, Peter and Vivian noticed that there was an obvious puncture mark on the side of his head, with a trace of dried blood. At this time, Peter had never heard of alien abduction. His memories were vivid and alarming, but he could find neither answers nor comfort from friends and acquaintances. Then, some months later, he and Vivian drove by a roadside billboard with an image of Whitley Strieber\'s book ""Communion,"" and they immediately got the book. Peter found numerous details in Strieber\'s account that matched his own strange experience. Peter\'s subsequent attempts to connect with local UFO groups and experiencers proved frustrating. Eventually, in April 1993, he resolved to found a new group in Sydney, the UFO Experience Support Association (UFOESA), dedicated to helping people understand and cope with their unusual encounters. He remains the coordinator of that group today. In July 1992, Peter had the experience that became the focus of this case study. Because the experience had disturbing sexual aspects, Peter was very reticent to talk about it. He first mentioned it to Bill Chalker, one of Australia\'s leading researchers, in 1996. He showed Chalker that he had recovered an unusual strand of hair from the encounter. At the time, Chalker felt he could not do anything with the physical evidence, but over the next several years, he assembled a group of scientists and forensic investigators willing to work on UFO-related cases. With his ""invisible college"" associates, Chalker discussed the possibility of doing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of mitochondrial DNA that might be recovered from Peter Khoury\'s hair sample. In early 1998, these researchers -- now calling themselves the Anomaly Physical Evidence Group -- agreed to do the DNA testing on the hair sample. Chalker points out that ""alien"" beings are most often described by experiencers as having no visible hair. But one type -- sometimes called ""Nordic"" -- is described fairly often as having distinctly human-like features including hair, often (though not always) blond in color. A number of well-known abduction cases have involved human-looking beings with hair, including the 1975 abduction reported by Travis Walton in Arizona, and the 1957 Brazilian abduction reported by Antonio Villas Boas. Peter Khoury\'s case has some similarity to that of Villas Boas, who said he was forced to have sex with an aggressive humanoid female aboard a landed UFO. Khoury told Chalker that his encounter of July 23, 1992 began at 7:30 in the morning while he was in bed. He had recently been injured at work and was taking pain medication. Earlier that morning, he had driven his wife to work, then returned home and went back to bed for a short while. Suddenly, he bolted wide awake and sat up. There were two humanoid females sitting on the bed, both entirely naked. These two women looked human in nearly every way. They had well proportioned adult bodies. One looked somewhat Asian, with straight dark shoulder-length hair and dark eyes. The other looked perhaps Scandinavian, with light-colored (""maybe bluish"") eyes and long blond hair that fell half-way down her back. Her hair was especially notable to Peter Khoury. ""I had never seen a hair style like that. It was curled something like Farrah Fawcett, but to an extreme... It just looked really exotic in a way,"" he told Chalker. But Khoury felt that these women were not exactly human. Their faces were somewhat odd -- not unattractive, but too chiseled, with very high cheekbones and eyes that were two or three times larger than normal. Khoury took special notice of the blonde. Her face was too long, he felt. ""I have never seen a human looking like that,"" he said. The blonde, who was sitting in a kneeling position on the bed, seemed to be in charge. Khoury thought she was communicating telepathically with the dark-haired woman, who was sitting with her legs partly folded under her. There was something stiff, almost blank, in the expressions of the women, Khoury thought. Though stunned by the sudden appearance of the women, Khoury had only a few moments to consider how they could possibly have arrived in his bedroom before the blonde reached out with both her hands and cupped the back of his head, drawing his face toward her chest. He resisted. She pulled harder. He kept pulling back. ""She was pretty strong,"" he told Chalker. ""She pulled me over and my mouth was basically on her nipple. And I bit."" Khoury said he doesn\'t know why he bit the woman, but even though he felt a small piece of her nipple come away in his teeth, she did not cry out. But ""the expression on her face was like, \'this isn\'t the way.\' In a way it was shock or confusion... She looked at the Asian one... and looked at me like, this isn\'t the way it\'s supposed to happen. You\'ve done this wrong."" Involuntarily, Khoury swallowed the small fragment in his mouth, and it caught in his throat. He went into a coughing fit. Suddenly, the two women simply disappeared. Once he realized the women were gone, he tried to clear his throat by drinking water. It didn\'t work. Then he had an urge to go to the bathroom. He realized that his penis felt very painful. Standing in the bathroom, he pulled back the foreskin and found two thin blond strands of hair wrapped tightly around. He struggled to unravel the pieces of hair as the pain became an intense burning sensation. Finally he managed to removed the two pieces of hair and immediately put them in a small sealable plastic bag. ""The reason I did that was because I knew that there was no way, no way at all, that a hair that size and wrapped around the way it was should have been there.... Thinking of these women, the thing in my throat, the hair, something bizarre had just happened."" Khoury resolved to keep the hair sample in case it should ever prove useful in shedding light on his experiences. The thing in Khoury\'s throat stayed there for three days. He coughed constantly. He tried clearing his throat with water, bread, anything he could think of, but nothing helped. On the third day, the feeling in his throat just went away. He did not want to tell his wife how his coughing fit had come about, but two weeks later he decided to tell her. ""I was shocked,"" he told Chalker. ""She accepted it better than I did."" The pieces of hair, carefully stored away since the encounter, became the subject of the first openly-reported scientific DNA test on a possible abduction-related sample. The blond hairs were extremely thin and almost clear in color. It was determined that the hair was not chemically treated, because if it had been, little or no mitochondrial DNA could have been recovered. However, using the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) process, good quality DNA was recovered. For comparison, samples were also taken of Peter Khoury\'s hair and that of his wife Vivian. DNA was successfully extracted from Peter\'s hair, but no usable DNA was recovered from Vivian\'s hair, possibly because of chemical treatment. After thorough testing of the hair samples, the scientists of the Anomaly Physical Evidence Group arrived at a startling conclusion. The thin blond hair, which appeared to have come from a light-skinned caucasian-type woman, could not have come from a normal human of that racial type. Instead, though human, the hair showed five distinctive DNA markers that are characteristic of a rare sub-group of the Chinese Mongoloid racial type. A detailed survey of the literature on variations in mitochondrial DNA, comprising tens of thousands of samples, showed only four other people on record with all five of the distinctive markers in the blond hair. All four were Chinese, with black hair. Mitochondrial DNA is passed only from mother to child and therefore offers a means of tracing ancient ancestry on the mother\'s side. The findings suggest that all four of the Chinese subjects share a common female ancestor with the blonde woman. But there is no easy explanation for how this could be. Testing for nuclear DNA, if such could be recovered from the blond hair, would be more complex and expensive than the tests run so far, but might show that the lineage of the blonde\'s father was even stranger than that of her mother. But such testing must await funding that has yet to be found. So far, the members of the Anomaly Physical Evidence Group have financed all their work themselves. Without the blond hair sample, the story told by Peter Khoury is but one more in an almost endless sequence of wrenching, but unprovable, abduction accounts. The hair, however, changes everything. It undeniably exists, and thorough forensic testing shows that it is anomalous. It seems likely that no person with blond hair and an exact DNA match to Khoury\'s blonde could be found in the city of Sydney, nor on the continent of Australia, nor -- probably -- anywhere in the world. Who then was the being whose blond hair inexplicably became wrapped around Peter Khoury\'s penis? ""Are we dealing with \'humans\' from elsewhere, namely those with human DNA, albeit very rare and somewhat anomolous?"" asks Bill Chalker. ""This case raises all sorts of issues, such as human \'panspermia\'"" -- the theory that human-like beings may have migrated to Earth in the fairly recent past from elsewhere in the galaxy, perhaps giving rise to the sudden appearance of modern homo sapiens sapiens, a species not directly descended from their immediate predecessors, the Neanderthals. ""Also, given the Asian mongoloid connection, we looked at the problem of European-like rare Asian types in the past,"" Chalker says. ""The controversial saga of the Taklamakan mummies in remote Western China is turning the early history of China on its head. These mummies include people who are quite tall, some 6 feet or so, and some are blond. I\'m not suggesting a connection here, but you can understand this investigation has opened up all sorts of interesting possibilities about the biological nature of some of the beings implicated in abduction cases."" These questions will not be easy to answer. But supporting the work of the Anomaly Physical Evidence Group could help.

1982, ,"[""Reader Recounts 1982 Encounter in Maine 1982-Eliot, MaineIt was the summer of 1982. I was 14, living in Eliott, Maine - a small town across the river from Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Our house was empty, as we were moving to Alaska that week, and the movers had already taken our belongings.  It was dusk, and I was upstairs in my room, laying in my sleeping bag, listening to the radio, looking out of the window that no longer had curtains. Suddenly I saw a black, geometric object zig-zagging rapidly in the air above the tree line of the woods behind my house. Its distance away from me was about 1.5 football field lengths.  Its motion reminded me of an air hockey puck, with seemingly instantaneous changes in direction. It was zig-zagging, but traveling in my general direction.  At this distance, the general shape of the object seemed to resemble a coffin - oriented flat with respect to the ground, with the wider end towards the direction of travel, which was towards me.  But it was hard to tell because of the distance away and the object's speed.  The object kept its height in the air constant, about 5 to 10 feet above the trees.  I got up and kneeled at the window to get a better look, but could no longer see it.  The way it moved made the sight seem unreal, and I stayed kneeling by the window for a few minutes to try to see the object again, but did not.  I could not comprehend what I had seen.  As I started to look away from the window to go back to laying down, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed the object hovering above my back yard, about 30 to 40 feet away from my window, at about the same height in the air as my window on the second story of the house.  It was perfectly still, and perfectly silent, and it wasn't there a second ago.  It looked like it was made of metal, but was a dull gun-metal black, with no windows, lights, doors or seams of any kind, but it did have a few small protrusions which looked like instrumentation - giving me the impression the object was some sort of machinery.  It was the approximate size of an automobile.  The shape was a trapezoid - a square or rectangle 'front' and a larger square or rectangle in the back, so the craft tapered from the back to the front.  It was like a pyramid tipped over on its side with the pointed portion removed.  Or maybe a better way to describe it is as a blunted wedge.  This shape seemed different from the way it appeared when it was zig-zagging above the trees, but I might have been mistaken of its shape when it was above the trees, since that was at some distance away, and moving rapidly.  I had absolutely no fear of the object - only curiosity as to what it was I was looking at.  I got to look at it for about 4 seconds, then it left in an instant.  It left so fast, that I could just barely tell that it left in a direction, rather than just disappearing.  The object left in the opposite direction it came from.  And though the craft seemed to have a front and a back, it did not turn around before reversing its direction.When the song on the radio ended, the DJ came on saying that he was getting inundated with calls about some object seen in the air.  I called the radio station as well, and told the DJ that I too had seen the object, but that was as much as I told him.I still, to this day, have never heard any other UFO report describing a craft shaped like this.  My whole life, I rarely thought about this experience.  Not until recently, when I saw a show on UFOs describing the same flight characteristic, did I really start to think about my experience, and realize that what I saw was a UFO.  I am an engineer now, and so understand that this craft displayed flight characteristics which defy our understanding of physics.  It had no wings or control surfaces of any sort, and was entirely silent.  It didn't need to move to stay aloft.  It seemed unaffected by gravity or inertia.  It had the ability to change speed and direction instantaneously - including the ability to hover perfectly still.  Supposedly, there were a lot of people who saw this craft that night.  So, maybe there are records of it somewhere.  It was a mainstream, pop radio station that I was listening to.

There was something ""unexplained"" going on in this place only an hour\'s drive north of New York City. The Hudson Valley UFO saga began at almost the beginning of a new year, 1982. Just a short time before midnight, December 31, 1981, a retired policeman was sitting in his backyard in Kent, N. Y. He saw a group of strange lights to the south. The lights were a brilliant red, green, and white, and at first, he thought they could be coming from an airplane in trouble. It was common for him to sit and watch the bigjets fly over at night. As the lights became closer, his opinion quickly changed. The lights were moving too slowly to be a plane, and now... they were too low, and there was no noise from an engine. What was the strange craft he was seeing?As the lights came closer, he could hear a  humming sound, and now he could see that the lights were arranged in a triangular shape, and there was a solid object of some kind connecting the lights. No, this was no aircraft he had ever seen before! The solid part looked like...a fuselage. That\'s what it was...a fuselage. He was looking at a UFO. This type of report would be repeated many times in the Hudson Valley over the next few years. All of them were similar, a V-shaped row of lights connected by a solid object of some type. Literally hundreds of witnesses would see this same sight. There was definitely something unusual going on in the skies over the Hudson Valley. Something that moved ever so slowly, so silently.On March 26, 1983, an article about the sightings appeared on the front page of the Westchester-Rockland Daily Item. The article recounted the many reports of the strange phenomena. The cat was out of the bag. The press coverage drew the attention of a group of UFO investigators who were associated with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, acclaimed scientist and UFO investigator. A thorough investigation followed, and ultimately a book, ""Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings."" The group began their inquiries by setting up a phone hotline. They received over 300 calls from individuals who had seen the strange V-shaped lights on the night of March 24, 1983 alone. Descriptions were very similar, if not identical. The object always moved slowly, and almost silently. It always had many lights, and they were always in a V-configuration. Some of the witnesses got a close enough look to say that the craft was large enough to be a ""flying city.""On the same night, the city of Yorktown also came alive with reports of this giant flying craft. The police switchboard was jammed with so many calls about the UFO that they feared not being able to respond to ""real emergencies."" Drivers pulled over on the Taconic parkway to watch the large object slowly make it\'s way across the skies. All in all, about 5,000 reports were made during a period of five years, from 1982 through 1986. The object was seen by multiple witnesses at night, never daylight. The sightings ranged as far east as New Haven, Connecticut, and as far north as Brookfield, Connecticut. Several theories were put forth about whether there was only one object, or many. Some additional accounts would come forward stating that the object, though moving slowly, would at times make a rapid, fast maneuver from one location to another. Also the lights of the craft could change colors in an instant.A report made from guards at the Indian Point Nuclear Plant would be one of the most dramatic. The gigantic UFO was seen hovering over the plant for periods of time, and moved as close as 30 feet from the reactor. Security supervisors even once considered ordering in planes to have it shot down. The object over Indian Point was described by some of the guards as 1,000 ft. long. Another witness described the object hovering over the Croton Falls Reservoir, using a red beam as it seemed to scan the surface of the water.Reasonable explanations for the sightings were offered. Skeptics suggested that planes, balloons, satellites, and even the planet Venus could explain away the accounts. Considering all of the information available, researchers could find only one object that could mimic the movements of the UFO, a blimp. All blimp manufacturers and pilots were contacted, and not one case of a blimp over the area on the nights of the sightings could be found. The Hudson Valley sightings are still a mystery today.(B J Booth)', '1982 - UFO Hovers over Nancy, France GardenFair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

1995, ,"['1995 - The American West UFO SightingA west bound America West B-757 airliner encountered a UFO with flashing lights along its length on May 25, 1995. The passenger jet was flying over the panhandle of Texas when it observed the unknown object.Thanks be to investigator Walter N. Webb, of the UFO Research Coalition for his thorough investigation of the case. Webb was able to get copies of the FAA voice tapes of chatter between the plane and ground. He also interviewed the crew and air traffic controllers.The plane was designated as America West Flight 564, and was at 39,000 feet near Bovina, Texas, when First Officer John J. Waller and a flight attendant observed a row of white lights which flashed from left to right.The lights were below their flying altitude. Waller immediately made radio contact with the Albuquerque FAA FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center during the observation. Nothing could be found that should be flying in that space at that time.The B-757 continued its course, and the lights began to fall behind it. A group of dark thunderclouds formed, and enabled the UFO to be seen as a cigar-shaped object as its lights illuminated the back drop of the thunderclouds.Waller and his co-pilot estimated the object\'s length at 300-400 feet. The object was not visible on FAA radar, but one of the controllers contacted the North American Air Defense Command, and was told they NORAD was tracking an unidentified object. But, this object later turned out to be a small plane with a non-functioning transponder.The next day, the controller made another check with NORAD, and he was told that they had indeed tracked another unknown target the night before that was at first stationary, but then accelerated and stopped again very rapidly. These quick darts were estimated at somewhere between 1,000 and 1,400 mph.When reports of the incident began to be leaked, Webb began to investigate. In addition to interviewing the airliner\'s crew, he also obtained the tapes of the conversation between FAA air traffic controllers and their contacts during the sighting. He was able to make drawings of the UFO.He also filed Freedom of Information Act requests, and searched military installations to see if any activity that night could account for the sighting. There was nothing that could explain the sighting of America West Flight 564, and until another explanation can be found for the unusual object, we can assume that a UFO was seen that night.This is a transcription of the communication between the crew of the America West flight and the Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control center. It also includes several conversations between the Albuquerque ARTC and other locations, including NORAD, that were contacted in an effort try to identify the object.There are three terms used in the following conversations that there are no explanations for: TIEBAND, BIGFOOT, and HIGH-BALLS. The term \'tieband\' is spelled phonetically, but any help with them would be appreciated. The recordings of the ARTC communications obviously include conversations with other aircraft and locations that do not pertain to the object reported by the America West flight.9:21pm...AW-564: ""Cactus 564 going direct crow, crow 6 arrival Las Vegas.""ABQ: ""Cactus 564...Albuquerque Center...good evening""AW-564: ""564 at 39,000\'""9:29pm...AW-564: ""Cactus 564...off to our 3:00, got some strobes out there.Could you tell us what it is?""ABQ: ""Uh, Uh..I\'ll tell you what, that\'s some, uh..right now...I don\'t know what it is right now.

He was flying at 180-210 kt on a N heading and squaking 5734 with Mode C selected. Although it was dark, visibility was over 10 km with a fairly strong NW wind (340/30). While flying just above the tops of some rugged Cu both he and the first officer saw a lighted (see JAS notes) object fly down the RH side of the ac at a high speed from the opposite direction. He was able to track the object through the RH windscreen and side window, having it is sight for a total of about 2 seconds. There was no apparent sound or wake. The first officer instinctively 'ducked' as it went by.The first officer reports that his attention, initially focused on the glare shield in front of him, was diverted to something in his peripheral vision. He looked up in time to see a dark object pass down the right hand side of the ac at high speed; it was wedge-shaped with what could have been a black stripe down the side. he estimated the object's size as somewhere between that of a light ac and a Jetstream, though he emphasised that this was pure speculation. it made no attempt to deviate from its course and no sound was heard or wake felt. He felt certain that what he saw was a solid object - not a bird, balloon or kite.MANCHESTER ATC reports that the B737 was being radar vectored from Dayne to the ILS for RW 24 when the pilot reported a lighted object passing close by above and in the opposite direction. There was no known traffic in the vicinity at the time and no radar contacts were seen.JAS Note (1): Telephone conversations subsequently took place with both the captain and his first officer. the captain remained convinced that the object was itself lit. Although he could not determine a definite pattern, he described it has having a number of small white lights, rather like a Christmas tree. He confirmed the high speed of the object, and though unable to estimate the distance, said he felt it was very close. Following the incident, the captain and first officer independently drew what they had seen, both agreed about the shape but differing in their opinions about the lighting aspects. The first officer felt that the object was illuminated by their landing lights, which at that stage were switched on. He was unable to assess the distance, other than to say that he involuntarily 'ducked', so it must have appeared to him to have been very close. He was entirely convinced, as was the captain, that they had seen a solid object and not a Met phenomenon, balloon or any other craft with which they were familiar, or a Stealth ac, which he [the captain] had himself had seen and which he feels he would have recognised.JAS Note (2): Despite exhaustive investigations the reported object remains untraced. A reply of the Ciee radar shows a number of secondary contacts, including the subject B737, being radar sequenced in the Manchester TMA and zone. The B737 tracks over two almost stationary primary contacts just N of Leek on a NW heading while descending through FL 70-60. On entering the Manchester TMA, passing FL 50, it is vectored right onto about 040 deg, and continues to descend on a NE track along the E boundary of the Manchester TMA to within 0.75NM of the Daventry CTA, where the base of CAS is FL 45. At this point, passing 3600 Mode C, the ac is turned onto a L base for RW 24 as part of a busy sequence of inbound ac. At no time during the downwind leg is any other radar contact seen in the vicinity. An extract from the RT recording on 119.4, which shows that the B737 was given decent clearance to 4000 ft at 1845:30, follows: From:B737 (1848) - 'c/s we just had something go down the RHS just above us very fast.' Manchester - 'Well, there's nothing seen on radar. Was it er an ac?' B737 - 'Well, it had lights, it went down the starboard side very quick.' Manchester - 'And above you?' B737 - 'er, just slightly above us, year.' Manchester - 'Keep an eye out for something, er, I can't see anything at all at the moment so, er, must have, er, been very fast or gone down very quickly after it passed you I think.' B737 - 'OK. Well, there you go!' The possibility that the object might have been a hang glider, paraglider or microlight was investigated, but all the operating authorities, without exception, agreed that this was an extremely unlikely explanation, for various reasons, but mainly because none of these activities takes place at night. In addition, there are obvious hazards of flying in the dark, from high ground (the peaks in this area along the Pennine ridge range from 1600 to over 2000 ft), string winds, and because these aircraft are unlit. JAS also explored the possibility of military activity, but could find no evidence in support of this from any official source. In any case, it seems most unlikely that such a flight would have been conducted in CAS and so close to a busy international airport. Because of the B737's proximity to the uncontrolled airspace to the E of Manchester, during the downwind leg, which covers the airmiss period, the possibility of unknown military or civil activity in the adjacent FIR cannot be completely discounted. However, the likelihood of such activity escaping detection is remote, as the area is well served by several radars and any movements a the levels in question would almost certainly have generated a radar response.PART B: SUMMARY OF THE WORKING GROUP'S DISCUSSIONSInformation available to the Working Group included reports from the pilot of the B737, transcripts of the relevant RT frequencies, a video recording, and reports from the air traffic controllers involved.The Group were anxious to emphasise that this report, submitted by two responsible airline pilots, was considered seriously and they wished to commend the pilots for their courage in submitting it, and their company, whose enlightened attitude made it possible. Reports such as these are often the object of derision, but the Group hopes that this example will encourage pilots who experience unusual sightings to report them without fear of ridicule. It was quickly realised by all members that, because of its unusual nature, they could only theorise on the possibilities once normal avenues of investigation had been explored. There is no doubt that the pilots both saw an object and that it was of sufficient significance to prompt an airmiss report. Unfortunately, the nature and identity of this object remains unknown. To speculate about extra-terrestrial activity, fascinating though it may be, is not within the Group's remit and must be left to those whose interest lies in that field. It is probably true to say, however, that almost all unusual sightings can be attributed to a wide range of well known natural phenomena. there are, of course, a few which defy explanation and thus fuel the imagination of those who are convinced that there is 'something going on' out there. Usually activity of this kind is accompanied by a rash of ground sightings in the same geographic area; in this case, as far as is known, there were no other reports and therefore the incident has to be viewed in isolation, with no other witnesses. The resources normally available when investigating airmisses are pilots' reports, corroborated by radar and RT recordings. Often these will provide all the clues necessary, but in this case there is no 'reported pilot', and radar recordings do not show any unknown contacts. The lack of a radar contact is not necessarily unusual if weather suppressors are in use on radar, particularly if the object generates a poor radar response. In these conditions the radar an interpret a non-transponding (primary) contact as weather, and therefore disregards it. Enquiries into military activity did not reveal any ac in the area at the time, and it was considered inconceivable that such activity would take place so close to a busy airport without some sort of prior notification. members put forward other suggestions, such as large model aircraft or commercially operated remotely controlled craft, such as those which are used for survey or photographic work. Considering the prevailing conditions - darkness, high ground, strong NW wind and the proximity of a major international airport - the Group felt that this kind of activity, together with the hang glider/microlight theory, could not be regarded as a realistic possibility. As was pointed out by one member, however, the extreme actions of a foolhardy individual cannot be entirely ruled out and there remains, therefore, the possibility that someone, perhaps in a microlight ac (which most accurately fits the shape described ), had defied the conditions and got airborne. Further talks with the microlight experts on this idea highlighted the extreme improbability; the strong wind, terrain and darkness would have rendered such a flight almost suicidal.Having debated the various hypotheses at length the Group concluded that, in the absence of any firm evidence which could identify or explain this object, it was not possible to assess either the cause or the risk to any of the normal criteria applicable to airmiss reports. The incident therefore remains unresolved.source and references:http://maxpages.com/mapit/CAA_REPORT_ON_NEAR_AIR_MISS\t"", 'Multiple Sightings-Central Coast, New South Wales, 1995-96Multiple Sightings-Central Coast, New South Wales, 1995-96During the period from December 1995 to January 1996, a spate of UFO sightings        had locals from the Central Coast area in New South Wales quite baffled.

Two on duty uniformed police officers, PC CLIFFORD WAYCOTT and PC ROGER WILLEY had spotted a pulsating flying cross while driving between the above locations. It was seen at low altitude moving above the treetops of the surrounding countryside. Intrigued, they began to chase the UFO, however they were never able to significantly gain on it. At times the object slowed to 50 mph and at one point came to a stop in mid air. The pursuit involved speeds of up to 90 mph and covered a distance of 14 miles. Whenever they did gain a little ground on the object it would simply accelerate away from them. Eventually they reduced their speed fearing an accident themselves. The closest distance they reached to the UFO was 400 yards. At one point they stopped at a farm to wake up the owner so they could gain some corroboration that they were not mistaken in their sighting. At a later press conference PC WAYCOTT said, “The light wasn’t piercing but it was very bright. It was star-spangled - just like looking through wet glass and although we reached 90 mph it accelerated away from us.” Before the object disappeared from view they saw a second UFO that was also cross-shaped, very bright and made no noise. Both officers were impressed by the relevant speeds of the objects as they quickly departed, especially the first one. Enquiries at nearby RAF Chivenor proved negative. Within 48 hours numerous other witnesses began to report sightings of similar objects.

Philip Lanning was driving south of town, on the evening of July 10, 1967, when his car coasted to a stop and the radio faded. Lanning got out and started to look at the car engine, when an enormous object flew over his head about 300 feet in the air. The object was silent and moving to the east. Lanning thought the object was about to crash. Just before the object reached a group of nearby trees, it tilted upward, turned right and then accelerated at great speed straight up into the low-flying clouds. The object was described as being 'like a cymbal on a drum set and was a dirty metallic gray in color on the underside'. He saw no portholes or hatches and said that it appeared to the size of house. Lanning wasn't sure who would be interested in the report, but he felt that it should be sent to someone in the US Government, so he forwarded it to a friend in Navel Intelligence. The Air Force eventually received it and began an investigation. They were impressed with Lanning as a witness as he was a former military officer who had received a great deal of training. After extensive research and interviews,  the Air Force was forced to label this sighting as unidentified. This was one of the very last reports in Bluebook to receive that tag. p>source:by Landon Howell  Owner & Editor - juiceenewsdaily.comhttp://www.juiceenewsdaily.com/0305/news/ufo_miss.html"", 'Ririe, Idaho, November 2, 1967-Three-1/2 Foot Tall Creature Floats to GroundGuy Tossie and Will Begay, two Indian youths, were driving south on Highway 26 just outside Ririe on November 2, 1967, when, about 9:30 p.m., there was a sudden blinding flash of light in front of their car, followed by the abrupt appearance of a small, domed UFO. The dome was transparent and in it were seen two small, strange-looking occupants. The car was brought to a stop - Begay, driving, did not have to apply the brakes - and the object hovered about five feet above the highway immediately ahead of them. It was about eight feet wide, and flashed green and orange lights around the rim. The area was bathed in a vivid green light. The dome opened as if hinged and one creature emerged, apparently floating to the ground. It was about three and a half feet tall, and on its back was a kind of pack that protruded above and behind its head. Its face was oval and heavily pitted and creased. Two small, round eyes and a straight, slit-like mouth completed the facial features. Large ears stood high on the hairless head. Approaching the driver\'s side of the car, the alleged being opened the door and slid behind the wheel. Horrified, the two witnesses pushed over to the right. The car began to move - whether driven by the being or ""towed"" by the UFO was uncertain. It was taken well out into a field of stubble wheat, and the UFO kept a fixed position a few feet in front of it. As the car stopped, Tossie, sitting next to the door, suddenly opened it and bolted, running for the nearby farmhouse of Willard Hammon about a quarter of a mile away. He later reported  being followed by a bright light - presumably carried by the second occupant. Meanwhile, in the car, Begay cowered in the front seat in a state of near-shock while the first creature jabbered unintelligibly at him, making sounds that were high and rapid, ""like a bird."" The second being, who had apparently given up chasing Tossie, returned to the car. The first then got out, and the two beings ""rose up and into the UFO,"" which then ascended in a zigzag path. Meanwhile, at the home of Willard Hammon, Tossie could scarcely make himself understood by the astounded farmer and his family. After having calmed the Indian down, they accompanied him back to the field, where they found the car. Begay was sitting nearly speechless with fright, his eyes tightly closed. The engine was running and the lights were still on - about 15 minutes had elapsed from the moment the young men had seen the flash. Hammon listened to their story and then followed the frightened youths home in his car. Perplexed, he later stopped in a local bar and grill to see if he could learn anything more. While there, a county deputy sheriff stopped in and Hammon told him the story.Later, both witnesses also came by and voluntarily told the deputy sheriff, in their own words, what had happened. State Police were summoned and an investigation was begun. It was discovered that a number of local farmers had reported that their cattle had bolted during the evening for unknown reasons. Others claimed to have seen lights in the area. The report was investigated for NICAP by C.R. Ricks, of Idaho Falls. During his investigation, he learned of a man who claimed that, on the same night, he had a similar encounter. Ricks eventually tracked this man down and confirmed the report, although the witness was emphatic about not revealing his name, and was reluctant about discussing the details of his encounter. source:http://www.nicap.org/newlook/section_VII.htm', '1967, The Falcon Lake Landing, Stephen Michalak, UFO Casebook Case filesPublished: 10:50 AM 4/19/2002', 'The 1967 Abduction of Patrolman Herb Schirmer In Ashland, Nebraska, on December 3, 1967, Herbert Schirmer, a 22 years young patrolman, was making his usual rounds. He had checked the Ashland Sales Barn, and several gas stations along Highway 6 when he noticed what he thought were red lights on top of a large truck. He had just passed through the intersection of Highways 6 and 63 at about 2:00 AM.He drove the short distance down 63 and stopped with his headlights shining on the object. According to Schirmer, the object was definitely not a truck. The red lights that he had seen were blinking through the oval portholes of a metallic, oval-shaped object that was hovering at a height of about eight feet above the road\'s surface. The object appeared to have a polished, aluminum surface and had a sort of walk around it. It had a structure underneath, like a landing gear.As he watched, the object rose into the air with flames coming from underneath. It passed almost directly overSchirmer\'s patrol car, then quickly shot out of sight.Schirmer returned to the police station, noting that it was now 3:00 AM., which surprised him because he felt that only ten minutes had passed. At the station, he made this entry into his logbook: ""Saw a flying saucer at the junction of highways 6 and 63. Believe it or not!""Afterward, Schirmer developed a red welt on his neck, a headache, and he began to feel ill. Word of Schirmer\'s sighting was related to the Condon Commission at the University of Colorado, which investigated UFO reports. Schirmer was asked to come to Boulder, Colorado. At Boulder, on February 13, 1968, he was hypnotized by psychologist Dr. Leo Sprinkle of the University of Wyoming.  Under hypnosis, Schirmer recalled that, after he stopped his car near the object, the engine died and his radio went silent. A white object emerged from the craft and seemed to communicate mentally with him, preventing him from drawing his gun as he was want to do.After the hypnotic session had ended, Schirmer was able to recall even more details about the encounter. The beings were friendly, they drew energy from electrical power lines, and they had a base on Venus.The Condon Committee concluded that: ""Evaluation of psychological assessment tests, the lack of any evidence, and interviews with the patrolman, left project staff with no confidence that the trooper\'s reported UFO experience was physically real.""Psychologist Dr. Sprinkle, however, felt that Schirmer ""believed in the reality of the events he described.""Returning to Ashland, Schirmer was appointed Ashland\'s Police Chief when Chief Wlaskin resigned. However, he resigned after two months, unable to concentrate on the job due to his UFO experience.According to Schirmer, he was ridiculed by some of the townspeople, his car was dynamited, andhis wife left him.Further regression hypnosis sessions were conducted on June 8, 1968,  by hypnotist Loring G. Williams and the results of those sessions were reported in two books: ""Gods, Demons, and Space Chariots"" and ""Gods and Devils fromOuter Space"" by Eric Norman.One odd fact that was brought out was that the aliens wore uniforms with an emblem of a winged serpent on the left breast, similar to the winged serpents that have appeared in mythology around the world.', 'Idaho Falls, Idaho, December 8, 1967, UFO with Occupants A report that contains some striking similarities to Mrs. Moreland\'s story of more than eight years before was investigated by C. Reed Ricks, who sent NICAP the details. On the night of December 8, 1967, Marilyn Wilding, age 15, of Idaho Falls, went out on her front step to look for a friend coming by to pick her up. It was about 7:40 p.m. The evening was dark and overcast, cold, with snow on the ground. Miss Wilding\'s attention was attracted to a light source reflecting on the snow and glancing upward she saw a large light above, partially obscured by the roof of her house.  Stepping out into the yard, she saw a large, brightly lighted object hovering not far above the end of her home. It was so bright that she was unable to perceive any other color than white. The object was circular in shape, ""about as big as a car.""  She told the NICAP investigator that it was close enough for some one to have thrown a rock at it and hit it. As she stood looking, the object tipped and rotated partly so that she was able to see that it had a domed top. In the dome, which was transparent, she could make out the indistinct outlines of two figures, but she was unable to make out any details because of the glare. She ran into her house and called for her younger sister to come and look, but the youngster was barefoot and did not come out. Miss Wilding then ran back outside in time to see the object begin to rotate, in a clockwise direction as seen from below. It maintained its tilted attitude while rotating, and therefore gave the appearance of wobbling. With this motion, it began moving away toward the north. As it receded into the distance, the light dimmed and turned orange in color.  The UFO\'s departure was observed from inside the house by Miss Wilding\'s younger brothers and sister, who had been alerted by the witness. (Mr. and Mrs. Wilding were not at home at the time of the incident occurred.) In her written report, Miss Wilding also gave the names of the Schuldt family, neighbors, as witnesses.  At its closest, the object was no more than 100 yards away, and from 50 to 100 feet above the ground. The incident lasted for approximately three minutes. Besides containing a number of details similar to those described by Mrs. Moreland, Miss Wilding\'s sighting may also be compared with another incident that occurred at Ririe, Idaho, a little more than a month earlier.  The six preceding occupant reports have one thing in common: the reported beings in each case were seen in or on the associated UFO. Also, five of the six reports took place during the decade of the 1950s. This is not to say that all occupant reports during that period described beings seen in or on the object; to the contrary, there are many reports on file in which the alleged occupants were reported outside of the UFO; and in some cases, strange non-human entities have been reported when no UFO could be immediately associated with their presence.  The following cases are examples of occupant reports in which the alleged beings were seen outside of the UFOs. All of them have occurred since 1964. Several of these cases contain features that are unique and bizarre: their reported high degree of strangeness places special demands upon our credulity. However, they cannot be eliminated out of hand simply because they do not conform to what we would prefer to expect of ""spacemen"" reports.  source:', ""1967, UFO Visits Ontario LakeWhat could be better than to be visiting Canada, a beautiful lake, night air, moonlit water? What a peaceful, relaxing idea that is. Unfortunately for two people, all of these nice things turned into a frightening experience, and changed their lives forever. From the notes of researcher Dr. Peter Millman comes this true story. At the time of this story, Millman was working for the Nation Research Council of Canada. He received the facts of the case from the Department of National Defense.The two people, who gave their report to Canadian officials, have asked to remain anonymous, for fear of ridicule. It was on June 18, 1967 that their case begins. Taking a nice, peaceful boat right down a northern Ontario lake, Mr. and Mrs. G. were visiting friends, and began their ride back to their cabin. As they are enjoying the moonlit night, they were suddenly shocked to see a brilliant object of unknown object. This object was simply hovering about 50 feet above tree level, and approximately one-quarter of a mile away from them. Slowing their boat down, they make a turn to get a full view of this strange object. As they sit in wonder, suddenly the object begins to pick up speed, racing straight toward them! Regaining his composure, Mr. G revs up his 75 horsepower motor, and gives it all it's got, heading to the lake's shore. The distance between themselves and the object allows them just enough time to arrive on the bank. They quickly exit the boat. Looking back up into the sky, they see the object has taken back it's original position. After a few minutes of time, Mr. and Mrs. G decide to try a return trip back down the river to their neighbors' house. Shortly after launching into the water, the object again makes a move to descend upon the two terrified witnesses. Again outracing the craft to the shore, the two ditch the boat, and run to another house, loudly and excitedly rousing their acquaintances. Their friends would later state that Mr. and Mrs. G were honestly and profoundly frightened to death by what they had seen.Now there were several more witnesses to this unusual, brilliant object..just hovering above the trees that surrounded the quiet waters of the lake. They watch the object for another 10-15 minutes until finally it races into the night to the west-northwest. Knowing that they had seen something quiet extraordinary, they make a full report of the incident. This unusual occurrence was meticulously detailed by Canada's National Defense team. Other details derived from a thorough questioning of the witnesses revealed several important facts. The object, though it did not show a light of any kind, caused the trees to move below it, as it hovered. The craft was distinguishable from the moon, as both objects could be clearly detailed simultaneously. The object was a traditional oval shape with a dome on top, estimated at 25-30 feet across, and 10-15 feet tall. Though the object rapidly streaked through the sky, no sound was heard by the witnesses, nor other guests at cabins in the vicinity. One guest did observe that at about the time of the incident, he was listening to his radio, when it suddenly went dead. Later in the evening, it was working fine again. The investigative team discovered a number of broken, wilted limbs directly below where the object had hovered. An analysis was made in Winnipeg, and the results of that examination was that no reasonable explanation could be offered for the damage to the tree limbs. The report also stated that the limbs showed signs of heat, and the samples contained no diseases or insect infestation. This is a classic case of an encounter of the second kind. This case was very well documented, and the object was listed as unexplained.""]"
1994, ,"['1994-UFO Sighting of Flight AF-3532On January 28, 1994, at the beginning of the afternoon, the crew of Air-France flight AF-3532 (Nice to London) observed an unusual phenomenon. UFOCOM asked some questions to the pilot and commander of the flight, Jean-Charles Duboc. INTERVIEW OF COMMANDANT DUBOC:You were a flight commanding officer at AIR France and on January 28, 1994, you have encountered an unusual phenomenon as you were doing the Nice to London flight 3532. Could you tell what you witnessed? I was indeed commander of flight AF-3532 of January 28, 1994, with copilot Valerie Chauffour, and 24 passengers on board. I have kept a copy of the ""OCTAVE"", which is the data-processing follow-up of the flight and I can specify that above the Paris area at the altitude of 11700 meters (FL 390), the outside temperature was of minus 59 Celsius degrees, and with a wind from the North-West had a speed of1 80 km/h (311°/101 kts). The visibility was of more than 300 km (150 Nm) and the cloud cover consisted of altocumulus. The flight encountered no air shakes. The navigation was under excellent weather conditions, in spite of the facing wind of almost 130 km/h (70 kts). That gave us a ground speed of 650 km/h (350 kts). The takeoff hour in Nice was 00h56PM UT and the arrival hour in London 02:13PM UT. It was a particularly calm flight, without particular problem. We arrived above Coulommiers when a steward who was in the cockpit noticed an object which he thought could be a weather balloon. This object was then seen by the copilot and myself a few moments afterwards. According to their description it seemed to have a variable form and to come very quickly across our road. I first identified it like an aircraft facing us, at approximately 45 km (25 Nm), at an altitude of approximately 10500 meters (25 Nm) and at an angle close to 45°. I found this slope absolutely abnormal because aircraft are not inclined at this altitude beyond 30 degrees without risking to fall down. This object seemed to us then absolutely abnormal by its size which seemed immense, its dark red color and of the fuzzy edges. I had the impression to observe a gigantic lens in evolution. It did not resemble anything we had seen in our flying careers. This object, this phenomenon, remained motionless while we left it on our left side, still at an approximate distance of 45 km. We observed it during a good minute, conscious that we were seeing something utterly anomalous. We continued to observe it when it gradually merged with the environment. We saw it becoming translucent, transparent, diluted in space. That was absolutely amazing. After some interrogations we contacted the control center of Rheims to announce this unidentified object to them, as we are required by air transportation regulation. Was this ""object"" tracked by your instruments? What about he black box of flight 3532? Were the communications between your aircraft and the control center in Rheims recorded? Our ON BOARD instruments are not intended to locate other aircraft. The airborne radar is only intended to locate storms in order to be able to avoid the air movements ascending and descending, associated with them, characteristic of these clouds, the cumulonimbus. During this event the radar was not in operation, as it is only necessary in instrument flying (IFR). In the same way, the black box cannot in any case detect aircraft or phenomena far away from the plane. On the Airbus 320 there is a first recorder which is the Quick Access Recorder (QAR). It records only flight parameters, speed, altitude, mechanics, engines, electric, etc. It is analyzed by the maintenance service. The second recorder, the DFDR, has the same recordings but must support the constraints of an accident. This recorder is analyzed only if a crash occurs or on request of the crew. As no parameter of our flight has been modified, the tapes were not analyzed because it would have been pointless. The UFO was at nearly 45 km of our aircraft, and there has been no electric or magnetic disturbances. On the other hand this UFO was approximately 10 km above Paris, and the Parisian people, under layer of clouds, were much closer to the UFO than we were. If there had been electromagnetic disturbances, a few million people would have noticed it. The communications were always preserved, and it is the same for the main TV and radio shows! Which were the continuations of this affair, at a professional and personal level? Have you been interviewed by the civilian or military authorities? In the immediate, the continuations were non-existent, because I did not submit a written report to avoid being ridiculed. It was three years later, as I read an article from Paris Match, which described how a UFO has been detected above Paris, that I made the connection between this UFO and that what I had seen. I then submitted a report to the Gendarmerie Nationale (French police, having an SOP for collection of UFO reports). Was your testimony transmitted to the SEPRA? Which were the continuations brought by this branch of the CNES? My report was transmitted by the Gendarmerie to the SEPRA, and the UFO Committee, was created within the framework of the Association of the Former Auditors of the Institute for the High Studies of National Defense (IHEDN). I was heard during nearly one hour and half by the group chaired by General Denis Letty. After discussing about the observation, we concluded that the object was approximately 300 meters in diameter. I took note of the radar recordings by the CODED (Operational Center of Air Defense). There is a very curious characteristic for the trajectory of the UFO, as it shows that it would have almost collided with us. The minimal distance on the recording is less than 1 Nm, that is to say 10 seconds of flight. This kind of observation is traditional in electronic war. The modern military aircraft are furtive, and at the same time able to synthesize a virtual image of themselves by delaying the radar echo. If a missile had been drawn on this UFO, which was above Paris, it would be our A320 which would probably have been hit by the missile. I think that it is not desirable to shoot fire at this kind of phenomenon. Did you speak again of your observation with your colleagues of flight 3532? Which is, now, their feeling about this affair? I never found the steward who was in the cockpit. My various requests to find the list of the crew for this flight were left unanswered by the of the commercial flight crew personal management (PNC). I had indeed four crew in two days, and I did not keep the lists of the members with me, because they are on the on board documentation. On the other hand I have reexamined the case several times with the copilot who has a very precise memory of the event, and who wrote a report for the gendarmerie (police) of the Charles De Gaulle Airport. I can only suggest you asking them about their feeling now. During your pilot career, have you heard from colleagues or other air personal, of similar phenomena? I barely speak about this encounter, and I had the surprise to note that about one out of ten pilot had observed a unidentified flying phenomenon. Your testimony appears in the COMETA Report, page 11, which has been published in a special edition of the VSD magazine, this summer 1999. Were you interviewed by this association? What do you think of this report, from a general point of view? As I said, I was actually auditioned by the above mentioned UFO Committee, which took shape in an association named COMETA. I have recently met Mr. Denis Letty along with a friend who is flight commander on the Concorde, responsible for the training of pilots at the General Management of Civil Aviation (DGAC), in order to study a regulatory possibility to have a reports form for UFO observations on the board of all French airliners. Their report seemed to me extremely well conceived, written by high level personalities, and constitutes a reference for UFO question. It still has some restricted diffusion because this subject is still one of the three great taboos of aeronautics. The first taboo is the cosmic radiation on aircraft. From May 2000 on, the flying personal will have to carry a dosimeter and the amount of radiation received each year will be measured and calculated according to the recommendations of the project SIEVERT which is developed by the General Management of Civil Aviation, the Institute of Protection and Nuclear Safety (IPSN), the Office of Protection against radiation Ionizing (OPRI), and the Observatory of Paris-Meudon. Flight crew of aeronautics, as well as astronauts will be soon classified among the people who receive amounts of radiations on their workplace. The amount of cosmic radiation received by passengers or members of flight crew during a Europe to US trip and return trip is similar to a lung radioscopy, and this fact is carefully hidden to the crews and the passengers since nearly 35 years. Indeed, a recommendation of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), back in 1964, requested that the airlines take measurements of on board radiations on airliners. A modification of the European regulation in May 2000, European directive 96/29 of May 13, 1996, divided by five the maximum amount of radiation applicable to the public, which will be able to take only 1 millisievert per year, instead of five. The airline pilots, hostesses, steward receive between two and five MVS per year, which is more than the majority of the workers in nuclear power plants. This taboo will disappear when the information circulates in the general public. The second taboo is the suicide of the airline pilots as they fly, and it will be shattered by the accident of the EGYPTAIR 990 flight, if the assumption of the suicide of the copilot is to be confirmed. The third taboo is the UFO phenomenon UFO, and in particular the 220 visual observations confirmed by radar, among them is mine. We can thank the COMETA team which, by the quality of its members, its knowledge, its overview, its hypothesis, makes it possible to start to discuss seriously about the sightings from all points of the planet. On December 7, 1999, TV viewers have an occasion to see you in the ""Why? How?"" show, animated by Sylvain Augier and Julie Bhaud, for the France3 channel. As I took part myself in the recording of this show, I had the pleasant impression that the questions were not ""oriented."" The ""And CO"" team (producing the show) seemed opened, although skeptic, and very sympathetic. If the editing does not suppress it, do you think that this kind of show can have some utility for general public? What do you think about the attitude of the medias, in general, as for their editing of UFO related information? As I wrote above, there are several taboos in aeronautics, and the reporters who dare to face these interdict risk to be ridiculed, but also to have trouble finding a job. This type of show require curiosity and courage, and the journalists know that they risk negative reactions, or aggressive reactions, and derision. This type of emission is very important for it makes it possible to give previously confidential information to the public. Information must pass gradually, whereas we must know that there will be all sorts of reactions. The bottom line of this problem is the maturity of the public. Is the public ready to receive the information? The social psychologists can consider the consequences which an official meeting with an extraterrestrial civilization would have, if they have several million years of technological advance. Which upheavals would be induced? Will there be panic in the population? Which disappointed hopes? Will we find the best, the worst, or both? Which information should be given to the public? Today, do you think that the origin of the UFO phenomenon is not our planet? The immensity of the universe, its beauty, its unknown features, the current technological progress, the space travels, the orbiting stations, and what I saw, can only convince me that we are not alone in the universe and that we will take part, if we do not destroy ourselves, in the community of the species which travel across the galaxy. The true current problem of our planet is not the existence, or not, of extraterrestrial civilizations but all the problems caused by pollution, the accumulation of the weapons of destruction, fanaticism, totalitarianism, the overcrowding of our planet.

He and his wife, Lise, have been with MUFON  Ontariosince then. Tom is now Deputy Director of MUFON Ontario, in Toronto.This case has had much coverage in the media. Tabloid televisionshows like \'Unsolved Mysteries\', \'Sightings\' and \'Encounters\' havegiven it much  air-time, as have cable-tv stations all over NorthAmerica. Internationally,  magazines  newspapers  and  news-letters   havedevoted  hundreds of pages to it and UFO conferences around the  planethave  intrigued  many  thousands  of  attendees  with  it\'s   seeminglystartling details.   \'Carp\'  has  achieved \'One Of The Most Significant  Cases  In  UFOHistory\'  status. You\'ve  probably heard,  seen and  read  about  ityourself. In  this  and succeeding issues we\'ll deal with the FACTS  of  thecase. We\'ll  describe the events,  as  told by the media and as we\'veexperienced them - and we\'ll try not appear too judgemental.Beginnings - 1989     Tom  Theofanous,  working with The Canadian UFO  Research  Network(CUFORN),   received   a  package  from  someone   calling   themselves\'Guardian\'.   It had no return address.     ""The  package contained a story about a UFO crash that  supposedlyhappened close to Carlton Place,  which is about a half-hour drive fromOttawa"",  Tom  said.    ""There  was also a photo-copied picture  of  anAlien.""     ""For  the  most part,  we thought it was  a  joke.    But,  CUFORNdirector Harry Tokarz decided to call Arthur Bray, a well-respected UFOauthor  and  researcher  who lives in Ottawa,  and ask him  if  he  hadsomeone in the Carlton area who could check out the story for us.    Asluck  would  have it,  Arthur knew a fellow who was fascinated  by  thefield of ufology, Graham Lightfoot."" Graham,  with  what was to become typical thoroughness,  used  thesomewhat  sketchy  co-ordinates  he got from Arthur Bray  to  not  onlypinpoint  the \'UFO crash-site\' near Manion Corners,  but also locate  anumber of witnesses.     One of those witnesses,  Diane Labanek,  claimed that on the nightof November 4th 1989,  she saw an intense,  bright light pass overhead,heading towards a swamp at the far end of the field behind and south ofher  home.  She  said  she also saw several  helicopters  earlier  thatevening using bright lights to scan the area.     Another  West Carlton resident recalled that that was the  weekendwhen  some cattle escaped from a nearby pasture and that it  took  tilllate Sunday to round them up.     A couple told Graham about the wife being scared by a very  brightlight shone through their south-facing bathroom window.    ""It  reachedright  down our hallway!"".   The wife also mentioned that  she  vaguelyremembered hearing the sound of helicopters at the time.     Others talked of ""dogs and cattle being disturbed"".     Many  people could think of absolutely nothing  unusual  happeningduring  the  course  of  the weekend,  including a  couple  who  had  atelescope set-up.     Graham  reported those findings to CUFORN,  along with results  ofhis  examination of the field and swamp behind Labanek\'s home  -  therewere  no signs on the ground,  anywhere,  of the heavy  equipment  thatwould be needed to recover a \'crashed craft\'.     His report closed with,  ""although I could find nothing conclusiveto support or disprove any of the witnesses claims.  I shall check backaround the area later this summer.""     The  same  Guardian  material  had  been  sent  to  several  otherinvestigators, researchers and UFO groups and as the story spread, boththe  former Provincial Director of MUFON Ontario Clive Nadin,  and  thecurrent  Quebec Director Christian Page,  visited the area on  separateoccasions,  and  spoke  to the \'witnesses\'.    They  confirmed  GrahamLightfoot\'s initial findings and agreed with Tom & Harry at CUFORN thatsomeone was ""trying to put us on - a hoax!""Guardian re-surfaces - 1991     In the middle of October 1991 CUFORN began receiving more Guardian\'information\' via the mail and all postmarked \'Ottawa\'.     An  envelope  with  some documents  that  mention  a  \'conspiracy\'between  the Chinese and  \'Grey Aliens that are planning to  take  overthe world\', arrived first.   Then came a Polaroid photograph of a \'UFO\'flying across an unidentified road.  A while later came a black & whitepicture of a grey-type \'Alien\'.     The  fourth delivery in the series was a package.    It  containedthe  now  infamous VHS video tape with a green label on  the  cassette,with a thumb print and the word GUARDIAN printed on the label.     There were also three playing cards in the package,  all with handwritten notes on them - an Ace, King and Joker.     A  photo-copied map showed the \'Grey\'s landing area\',  along  withnotes  explaining  that the flares in the video were used to  help  theUFO,  which  can out maneuver anything on the planet,  fly  under  theradar and know where to land!     There   were  also  \'Canadian  Department  of   National   Defensedocuments\'  enclosed - which,  upon later investigation,  proved to  beforgeries.     These \'documents\',  it is thought,  were designed to look like theofficial documents on UFOs that Canadian UFO author/researcher  StantonFriedman  acquired,  via  \'The Freedom of Information  Act\',  from  theUnited States Government.     The  video - a few minutes long - showed two different  angles  ofwhat Guardian alleges was an \'alien craft\', on the ground.     First,  a long shot of bright lights clumped together to the rightof  the  scene and what looked like four red emergency road  flares  orfires in barrels on the left side of the screen.     The  second  scene  showed the same clump of  bright  lights  fromapproximately  the  same distance but more to the  centre  without  anyflares and the sound of a single dog barking in the distance.     The third scene was only three frames long and was a close-up of aa pair of wipers half-way across a very Earth-bound vehicle!     CUFORN pondered what to do with all the Guardian information  thatarrived  in October of \'91 and decided,  that in view of the  season  -winter,  that  they  would hold off visiting Carlton  until  after  thespring run-off.Enter Oechsler     At the beginning of March \'92, Bob Oechsler (pronounced Bob Ex-ler)an American MUFON investigator - who describes himself a  \'former  NASAmission specialist\'  - called CUFORN from his home in Maryland.     Apparently,  he  too  had  received a  video  and  documents  fromGuardian,  although when comparisons of the two videos were  discussed,his had an additional scene - a somewhat closer one minute shot of  the\'alien craft\'.     His version also had a couple of minutes worth of the  windshield,plus several still shots of the \'Grey Aliens\'.     The most important difference,  however,  was that his version  ofthe  tape  had no audio-track at all - ""it seems it  was  intentionallyremoved"", says Tom Theofanous.     Oechsler had shown the tape to Bruce Macabbee and they agreed  thatwhat they saw was a UFO and should be investigated further - and that\'swhy  Oechsler  called Tom at CUFORN.   They agreed they would  meet  inCarlton, Ontario on May 10th 1992.     Tom  then called and spoke with Graham Lightfoot,  for  the  firsttime, and Graham agreed to act as guide for the May meeting.     It  transpired  that  Graham worked for The O.F.A  -  The  OntarioFederation  of Agriculture - and knew the Carlton area and its  farmerswell.       The First Visit       On  May  10th,  Mother\'s  Day,  1991,  Torontonians,  Tom  &  LiseTheofanous,  Victor  Lourenco,  Vaughn [LAST NAME?],  Drew  Williamson,Harry Tokarz and Wayne St.  John met with Oechsler,  his son and GrahamLightfoot  at the motel the Oechslers were staying at in West  Carlton,near Ottawa, Ontario.     They  all  had  breakfast together as  Oechsler  told  many,  manyfascinating  stories.    Eventually they ended up in  Oechsler\'s  motelroom to compare their copies of the Guardian video.     ""Oechsler,  despite being an expert in video analysis, had a greatdeal  of difficulty connecting my video camera up to the tv set in  hisroom  so that we could play back the Guardian videos.   In  retrospect,his combination of technical ineptness and more story telling seemed tobe a stalling tactic"", said Tom.       They  stopped  at  a spot off Highway 7 near  Manion  Corners  andGraham  pointed  out the direction from which the 1989 \'UFO\'  had  comewhen  it \'crashed\',  and where the Labanek\'s house was in  relation  towhere the group was standing.     Oechsler  seemed  to  be stalling once  more,  shooting  video  ofeverything.     Finally, they set off again.     ""This  time  Oechsler took the lead,  with me  following  him  andGraham  who\'s supposed to be our guide following me!""   Tom  says.   ""Ithought at the time that this was pretty odd.    How did Oechsler,  whosupposedly had never been to Canada,  let alone this area before,  knowhis  way,  using  side-roads  and making the correct  turns toward  ourdestination?""       Earlier,  Oechsler  had  asked  the Toronto  group  to  check  foranomalies  on  their compasses while they  were  driving,  because  theGuardian papers described magnetic changes in certain parts of the areathe group was travelling in.     ""So, we\'re driving down a small hill when Oechsler braked suddenlyup ahead of us, stopped and came back to our car to tell me that he hadfound an anomaly on his two compasses"", Tom recounts, ""now, he had bothof his laying in the back of his pick-up on the metal floor where  theywere  bouncing around.    His son was keeping an eye on them  from  thecab.  I told him that the three compasses,  we were holding in the palmsof our hands,  in our car didn\'t waver at all.    But, he insisted thathe\'d go back up the hill, by himself, and check again.""     While  the  rest of the group stood around waiting  for  Oechsler,Drew  Williamson  noticed  a Stop-sign at the end of  a  long  drivewayleading to an abandoned farmhouse with a For-Sale sign on it.     Tom  continues - ""I looked through my binoculars at the  Stop-signand  saw  that it was propped up by rocks.    There  were  other  signsaround it that read \'Do Not Enter\' and \'DND Killing Fields\'.   The lastone  had  pictographs  of tanks,  helicopters and  weapons  on  it  andappeared to be riddled with bullet-holes.       ""So,  out of curiosity, we went over to the signs and looked  moreclosely.""     ""We  found  tracks  left by cars and what might  have  been  four-wheeled vehicles, leading into the property.   We felt that perhaps thefield  around  the old farm house was being used for \'War Games\'  -  ormaybe even was the location used for the Guardian video.""     ""Why?   Because the terrain was perfect - lots (200 acres) of openfield.   I also noticed a dog barking up at the house at the top of thehill."" said Tom.     This  would become significant later in identifying  the  possiblelocation of the Guardian video shoot.     ""Eventually,  we  continued  along Corkery  Road.    But,  when  Imentioned to Oechsler that we should be interviewing the people in  theneighbourhood  we  were passing,  who were out sitting in  their  frontgardens  or working on their lawns,  he insisted that we look  for  the\'crash\' or \'landing\' sites.""     Guardian\'s  map  described an area about one and a  quarter  milessquare, which consisted of dense, knee-high scrub, and wet, swampland.       The  group  headed toward it,  using a path  beneath  high-tensionpower transmission lines that cut across below the southern end of  theLabanek\'s property.     Most  of them had great difficulty with the rough  conditions  andbecame  very  tired,  annoyed by biting mosquitoes and  soaked  by  theswampy  ground.  They gave about a half way into the swamp  and  headedback to the back to the parking lot.     Tom picks up the story again:   ""Bob and his son continued to lookfor  the landing site as the rest of us left the swamp in a  couple  ofdifferent groups.   Lise,  Drew,  Wayne and I left first and drove  offlooking for a drink of cold pop.""     ""When  we got back to the parking lot twenty  minutes  later,  thesecond  group out had left a note on our windshield saying they\'d  meetus at a restaurant twenty minutes away in Carp.   We left a note on theOechsler\'s truck windshield telling them where we\'d be.     ""The first of our group to arrive at the restaurant ordered  theirfood  and  twenty minutes later the rest of us arrived and  placed  ourorders.""       ""Thirty  minutes  later,  as  Oechsler and his  son  were  walkingthrough the door, I jokingly said: I bet he\'ll say he found the spot!""     ""As  he sat down,  I asked him what had happened.   He smiled  andsaid he\'d found the spot.""     ""I asked how he\'d managed to do that when we\'d left him a about  amile  from his car in a dense swamp halfway to the alleged site and  itwas getting dark.    There simply hadn\'t been enough time to get  thereexamine  the  \'site\'  and get back out to his truck and  drive  to  therestaurant.   He just smiled, but didn\'t answer.""     After they finished their dinner,  Drew, Victor and Vaughn decidedto leave for Toronto.     Graham  suggested  that  the  remainder  should  go  talk  to  theLabanek,  and he and Harry left ahead of Tom & Lise and the Oechslers,since Oechsler senior was still eating.    The seven of them would meetat the corner by the Labaneks.     ""Lise,  Wayne  and I confronted Oechsler out in the  parking  lot,where the three of us had gone to discuss the days events privately.""       ""I  asked him what he was trying to pull here.    He responded  byasking  ""what\'s wrong with trying to make a buck?"",   I  answered  thatthere  was  nothing  wrong  with making money  as  long  as  we  didn\'tcompromise our ethics.""     ""Oechsler  came back with:  ""No matter what or how good the  storyis,  50% of the people will believe you,  50% wont.    All you have  tocare about is the 50% that will"".     ""It was at that point"",  recalls Tom, ""that I decided to back awayfrom the investigation for a while to see what Oechsler would do.""     They  joined the others at Manion Corner by the Labaneks house  -Graham had knocked on their door but there was no one  home.  So,  theywaited, enjoying a pleasant early summer evening, talking.     The  Labaneks didn\'t get home till after 10 p.m,  which the  groupfelt was late to do an interview.   Graham and Oechsler would come  backthe next morning and talk to them     Tom finishes up this part of the story:  ""I told Graham about  theconversation  that  I  had in the parking lot of  the  restaurant  withOechsler, after he left the restaurant.   Then Lise, Harry, Wayne and Ileft for Toronto, shaking our heads.""

Blue, white, red, and green lights, sometimes attached to cylindrical objects, and sometimes performing unusual maneuvers, were reported.911 operators began receiving calls at around 9:30 p.m. about something that looked like ""a string of Christmas lights way up in the sky."" It wasn\'t just a few people reporting these things; it was counties all up and down Lake Michigan. Some sources said 300 witnesses, including several police officers, saw the lights.There were so many reports that one of the Ottawa County 911 operators decided to call the National Weather Service radar operator at Muskegon. The conversations that 911 had with the NWS operator were taped and later made their way into the media. The radar operator\'s voice could be heard describing abrupt movements of the object and multiple objects appearing on the radar screen.He said that what he was seeing could not be precipitation, especially at that height. One object was tracked moving twenty miles in ten seconds.Holland police officer Jeff Vellhouse spoke to the operator of the Muskegon radar that picked up the radar tracks: ""He said he had three things on his radar, and they were in a triangular shape. He said they hovered over Holland and moved southwest. He said that one would move out of the triangular pattern, then move back in.""The radar operator also reported:""There were three and sometimes four blips, and they weren\'t planes. Planes show as pinpoints on the scope, these were the size of half a thumbnail. They were from 5 to 12,000 feet at times, moving all over the place. Three were moving toward Chicago. I never saw anything like it before, not even when I\'m doing severe weather.""It was said that there was no NWS written or taped records of the radar contacts themselves, but Dave Reinhart of BIMUP (Bureau of Investigators of Mysteries & Unusual Phenomena) claimed to have received copies of the NWS radar operator\'s report in late 1994. He also said that he had talked to an individual referred to as ""Fred"", who worked at Area 51 and who had knowledge that what occurred on the night of March 8, 1994 was some sort of rendezvous of UFOs from the east, west, north, and south.Scott Ruiter of Grand Haven saw the lights in Grand Haven Township at 10:30 p.m. March 7: ""It looked like about five airplanes following each other fairly closely. One would blink, then the other, other and other, right to left,""The National Weather Service later tried to downplay the radar trackings: ""There is no relation between the UFOs and the radar tracks,"" said Dean Gulezian, the weather service\'s area manager for Michigan. Gulezian said that although the radar did show some echoes, one key thing is the eyewitnesses saw these things at tree-top level, while the radar echoes were from an altitude of 10,000 feet or higher.""(Note above where the first witnesses reported seeing something like a string of Christmas lights ""way up in the sky"")Randee Murphy and her husband, of Ada Township, observed a ""huge"" shape for about two minutes as it flew slowly about 100 feet over the woods outside their home. ""It had four lights,"" she said, and ""made a soft, whirring noise. It sounded like a single jet engine.""The Michigan flap continued for several days, presumably ending on the 10th. The sightings were never adequately explained.', ' 1994,  The Mongo Photo Case, Indiana, August 31Prime witness met and talked with two hunters the following day at 10:30 AM EDT. They had been enroute to the campground from Ft. Wayne, IN, and when they were 1/2 mile south of Mongo they spotted a white object move in front and to the east at low level at a high rate of speed. This was at the same time of 2130 EDT.  Newspaper accounts show at least two other good witnesses (the Martins) testifying that this was no blimp. Reports of a blimp (Family Channel) in area. Finally, a man, his wife, and two daughters saw the same or similar object at Hamilton, IN, and took videos. Their sighting was at 8:45 PM and a little over 20 miles SE of Mongo. The object was less than 100\' up and there was no sound. Although some of video was erased, the object in one scene is large, pear shaped, and definitely not a conventional object.  The blow-ups of the Mongo object were received on October 21st and were cropped negatives #8 & #9. JK had another pair of negatives at the time of the interview, #4 & #5. After making prints from #8 & #9 a few days prior to this interview, he had swapped negatives with the camera owner.  The witness says the first photos are more distinct. ""You are going to be more impressed with the ones I just got yesterday,"" he said. Negatives #6 & #7 reportedly did not show the UFO. The blow-ups and prints were made on a department store customer-operated Kodak machine called ""Create-A-Print"".  Photo #8 shows object (moving west to east in downward course) with illuminated leaves in the foreground due to camera flash. Photo #9 is similar, w/o flash, object still moving west to east and downward. Camera flash had been turned off for #9.  In the first two photos the object had come closer and reportedly looked like a ""fried egg"".  I requested that he fill out a Form 1 and try to get the others (5) to do the same. Six Form 1\'s were provided.  A drawing was supplied with the blow-ups of negatives #8 & #9, and witness states that this is what the UFO looked like, as it was very bright and coming in, first like the moon. Object had panels that could be seen when the object was due south. He says drawing/photos don\'t do justice to the actual event. There was absolutely no noise. Three dogs did not react in any way.  He was out hunting the next day and actually saw the Family Channel Blimp that others had reported. ""There is no way in hell (that) we saw a blimp that night.""  The object they saw and photographed on the 31st was no further than 1/4 mile away, and from 500\' high to as low as 100\' at one point. Witness then states the object was more vivid when first coming in. Apparently the object was receding on subsequent shots. At first he thought the object to be a bright meteor. It didn\'t take long for them to realize that the object was not a meteor. In negative #4 & #5 you ""can see a distinct line right around the center"", he said.  Preliminary EvaluationSource Test, Natural: All natural sources were eliminated. An EZC Skyplot for Mongo coordinates during time slot shows three planets as conspicuous targets. Jupiter and Venus were in the SW, Saturn was in the SE. Description of object, movement, and number of witnesses precludes a misidentification of an astronomical object. Also, an on-site investigation by John Timmerman of CUFOS failed to show any other natural source that might explain the sighting.  Source Test, Man-Made: Advertising, commercial, military, and private aircraft eliminated. A blimp seemed possible. Witness testimony appeared to rule this out. Later analysis by Dr. Richard Haines effectively ruled out any type of blimp or any other source. We had already eliminated a balloon, fixed structure, hoax (on witness or by witnesses). Twelve witnesses were reliable, object was real, description and photos (and a video) indicate an unidentified craft was in the area, along with a possible blimp.  Evaluation: Unidentified craft. Berliner Strangeness Scale: 2 (Night object); Berliner Credibility Scale: 7 (Still photo(s) by professional). Speiser Strangeness Factor: S5 (Highly strange; suggests intelligent guidance); Speiser Credibility Scale: P5 (Highly credible, leaving almost no doubt).  ConclusionsThe self-luminous aerial object seen and photographed at Mongo, Indiana on August 31, 1994, has remained unidentified after the various evaluations cited above. On the one hand, its overall shape and flight characteristics are not unlike many scores of other UFO reported for more than fifty years from around the world, many of which were captured on photographs. On the other hand, a blimp definitely was seen during the night of August 31, 1994 in the Mongo area. The aerial object photographed cannot be positively identified at this time. It remains a UFO.  Comments by the State DirectorWe have been unable to obtain any official flight records for any blimp flights explaining the Mongo event. Two different blimp companies were ""identified"" (Family Channel & Virgin Lightship) by ""authorities"". A current and separate investigation is underway involving a video taken the same evening at Hamilton, Indiana just a few miles SE of Mongo! The witnesses also claim the object at one point was less than 100\' over them, was as big as a football field, and made no noise!  source:www.nicap.com', ""1994 - The Trumbull County, Ohio, UFO IncidentPublished: 9:21 AM 3/28/2010by B J Booth, www.ufocasebook.comA series of unusual events unfolded on December 14, 1994, in Trumbull County, Ohio. Just after midnight on a late Fall night, a series of calls was received by 911 operators. These reports all involved one thing- reports of low-flying UFOs. The majority of these calls were heard by dispatcher Roy Anne Rudolph.Reports mostly related a fairly fast moving, unknown object / lights that seemed to be descending. Naturally at first, 911 operators thought the callers were seeing a balloon, plane, helicopter, or other everyday object.But, because of the extraordinary number of calls, Rudolph decided to notify the policemen of Liberty Township. The first police unit contacted thought that the reports were probably nothing to worry about, and that a plane was probably flying low.Sergeant Toby Meloro was the first officer on the scene, as he proceeded down Samson Drive to check out the lights. He was informed by a man on the street that the lights were moving south.As Meloro continued southerly on Samson Drive, suddenly his cruiser went dead. As he attempted to restart his vehicle, it was engulfed by a bright light from above.Startled and frightened, he exited his vehicle, and stood outside looking up at a giant object, circular in shape, and intensely bright in the center section.After about thirty seconds, the giant object moved away. One the most striking things about Meloro's sighting was that he heard not a sound from the UFO. After the object had moved out of sight, the police cruiser's functions returned to normal. Trying to understand what he had just seen, he took off in pursuit of the UFO.Meloro was unable to keep pace with the UFO. He called dispatch, informing them what he had seen, and gave the object's direction of flight.Soon, this information was related to all active law enforcement units in the area, and reports of the object's direction were used to triangulate the object, and enable units to move to its location.Dispatcher Rudolph later stated that at least 14-15 officers had seen the UFO. Their reports of the object and its movements were openly discussed among the officers on the police radio.Police dispatch, with reports of the UFO spreading to adjacent communities, called the local airport FAA control tower, and asked if they had anything unusual on their radar. Control tower stated that they had nothing unusual on their scope, which covered a 60 mile diameter around Youngstown.Researcher Kenny Young did an in-depth study of the Trumbull County sightings. His requests for Freedom of Information Act documents regarding the case was denied. He interviewed officers involved in the case, and was confident that they were telling the truth.Lieutenant James Baker, of the Brookfield Township Police Department, was one of the officers monitoring the fantastic calls, and decided to have a look for himself. He climbed up an abandoned radar tower in the area to get an optimum look at the object.As he reached the top of the tower, he was shocked at what he saw - not one, but three UFOs. The three objects were in a triangle pattern, with the middle object slightly higher than the two on the side.Also, Baker stated that the object changed colors in unison - red, yellow, blue, and green. He reported his observation to the other patrolmen on duty.Astronomers have tried to explain the sightings as simple stars that appeared low in the sky, and appear to change colors. Of course, this does not explain the malfunction of police vehicles, lights engulfing them, or objects moving across the landscape being chased by policemen.Some have theorized that the object seen by the policemen of Trumbull County was a top-secret craft from the Youngstown Air Reserve Base. However, Captain John Keytack, from the base, stated that there were no planes, experimental or otherwise, flying that night.The policemen of Ohio have spoken often about what they saw on December 14, 1994 - Police cars that inexplicably stalled, light beams engulfing their vehicles, one or more structured craft of a nature never seen before or since.The 1994 sightings of Trumbull County have never been adequately explained by conventional flying objects.(B J Booth)""]"
1965, ,"[' Flying Disc Lands on Highway, Pretoria, South Africa, 09-16-65 This case was first reported by the Associated Press,  Johannesburg, S. Africa, Sept.17, 1965, and first published in the United States by NICAP. The first information was related by UFO investigator and writer Richard Hall. This case, though not heavy in detail, features a vehicle encounter, UFO landing, and physical traces, along with official secrecy.The events occurred as Constable John Lockem and Koos de Klerek were doing routine patrol on the Pretoria-Bronkhorstspruit road. It was just past midnight when to their utter amazement, the lights on their police van lit up an object ahead of them on the road. Sitting right on the highway was a disc-shaped object. The object was not anything they had seen before.With the object lit up from their headlights, it appeared to be of a copper color, and was about 30 feet in diameter. After only a few seconds, the UFO began to rise above the road, and quickly sped away,  throwing flames from double tubes of some type on the bottom. The two men must have been in awe, wondering from where the strange, unknown object had come from, and where it was going. Later as the men reported their unusual encounter, Constable Lockem stated: ""Its lift-off was quicker than anything I have ever seen."" Flames from the asphalt road had shot up into the air about 3 feet, according to the witnesses. The heat was so intense that the fire lasted for a time, even after the object had zoomed away.Further investigation indicated that parts of the road had caved in, as if from a heavy object resting on it. The gravel had been separated from the tar in an area severely burned about six feet in diameter, indicating the center underneath of the UFO. An official investigation into the incident was carried out by  Lt. Col. J.B. Brits, District Commandant of Pretoria North.In an interview for a local newspaper, Brits told reporters that the case of the UFO landing was considered ""as being of a highly secret nature and an inquiry is being conducted in top circles."" Samples of the damaged road material were taken by a scientific agency for analysis, but the results were never released to the public. Because of the location of the event, and its age, it is unlikely that more information will be forthcoming. The case remains unexplained.original report by Richard Hall Source: UFOs: A New Look (NICAP 1969); Associated Press, Johannesburg, S. Africa, Sept.17, 1965.

This sighting, which occurred on the William Butcher dairy farm near Cherry Creek, N.Y., involved three members of the Butcher family and a fourth witness.  Here is their report: At 8:20 PM, Harold Butcher, 16, was operating a milking machine in a dairy barn housing 17 cows.  A portable radio on the wall was turned to a newscast, when a sudden static-like interference drowned it out.  Then the tractor which ran the milking machine abruptly stopped.  A moment later, a Holstein bull secured outside began to bellow and pull at a steel bar to which it was chained.Young Butcher ran to a window and saw a large elliptical object near the ground, a fourth of a mile away.  A reddish vapor could be seen underneath, and he heard a steady beep-beep sound.  The UFO was on the ground only a few seconds, then it shot straight up, disappearing in low clouds.   When the other witnesses came out, after Harold Butcher phoned the house, they noticed a strange odor, also a greenish glow in the clouds where the UFO had vanished.  Meantime, it was found that the bull had bent the steel bar in his efforts to get loose.     Half an hour later, when the strange craft reappeared, circling the area, Mrs. Butcher called the State police.  Two troopers investigated, notified the AF.  Next day, Capt. James Dorsey, Operations Officer, 4621st AF Group, arrived with four AF technicians.  When they examined the ground, an odd, purplish liquid substance was discovered at several places.  Small unexplained marks, two inches wide and two inches apart, also were found, along with patches of singed grass and foliage.     After the AF team left, NICAP member Jeffrey Gow obtained samples of the purplish substance and singed foliage, and samples were studied by the Kawecki Chemical Co., whose president is a NICAP adviser.  Spectrographic analysis showed the main elements of the liquid to be aluminum, iron and silicon.  Some phosphorous was found in the weed samples, which the analyst said might cause a phosphate smell, explaining the odor.     On the night following the Cherry Creek incident, State Trooper Richard Ward, a few miles from this area, watched an object with eight circular lights in line flying twice as fast as a jet.  It emitted a faint, unfamiliar, purring sound.     Dr. Fred C. Fair and John Maxwell, of NICAP New York Subcommittee No. 2, carefully checked the Cherry Creek site and questioned the witnesses.  On the basis of present evidence, they believe the report is genuine.  Dr. Fair has confirmed that two state troopers who investigated also seem to be convinced.Animal Reaction Feature:A 3-year-old Holstein bull was secured to a steel bar outside of a dairy barn containing 17 cows. About 8:20 PM, Harold Butcher, 16, was operating the milking machine when the radio had static-like interference and the tractor motor running the milking machine cut off.  The bull made a noise “like I have never heard come from an animal before.” Harold looked out the window at the bull, which was trying to get lose, and he saw an elliptical object nearing the ground with a “beep-beep” sound about a quarter of a mile away (1320 feet). After hovering briefly on or near the ground, the object shot up into low clouds.  As the object rose, the noise pitch increased to a level approximating a sonic boom.  The cows produced only one can of milk that evening rather than the normal 2 ½ cans.  Later examination of the bar to which the bull was secured found it bent.Joan Woodward, Animal Reaction Specialist:The object was metallic-looking, football shaped, and estimated to be 50 feet long and 20 feet thick.  A reddish vapor was emitted from the bottom area and when the object rose, the red vapor shot toward the ground and bounced back toward the object. The clouds had a greenish glow where the object had vanished.  At 9 PM, the object was seen again by several people at the farm.  It now had a glowing yellow vapor trail.  The clouds still appeared to have a green glow.  State police were called and investigated and the Air Force investigated.This incident involved EM effects.  A tractor motor shut down, the barn radio and house radio had static-like interference, but a telephone between the barn and house apparently worked.  Physical traces included an odor, ground marks, a purple liquid, and grass bent over and singed.Physiological effects included Harold and his younger sister having upset stomachs, and the cows giving less than normal amounts of milk.

He had planned to spend several days there. On the night of the 14th his hunting dogs took after a deer. Later, hearing a sound like a gunshot, Flynn started up his swamp buggy and headed off in search of his dogs. One of his dogs had returned, which he had placed in its cage, and it accompanied him on his search for the others. Around 1 a.m., on Monday, March 15th, Flynn spotted something unusual that he judged to be slightly over a mile away. Whatever it was, it was hovering, shaped like a broad, upside-down cone, an estimated 200 feet in the air above some cypress trees. After a while it began flying off toward the Northeast. After some 2 to 3 minutes, it returned to the same place, and hovered again, this time for an estimated 5 minutes. Then it took off toward the Southwest at a high rate of speed. Soon, however, it returned to the same location again. At this point, Flynn was only about a quarter of a mile away, and the object seemed to come down among some trees into a small knoll. Flynn figured, up to this point, that he was observing a helicopter of some sort, but then he began to study it through a pair of binoculars and he realized that he wasn't looking at a helicopter at all. Then he began to suspect that it was some secret craft from Cape Canaveral. Flynn described the object as some 25 feet high, and twice that in its diameter. Up near the top were four tiers of two-foot-square square window-looking sections that emitted a yellowish glow. The thing was metallic, and seemed to be made of four-by-four plates that appeared to be held together with rivets. Around the base there was an orange-red illumination that seemed to cast a glow on the ground some 75 feet around its rim. Sometime later he regains consciousness. Finding himself initially blind he lays there for a long while until he recovers a small amount of vision in his left eye. By this time, the sun is shining and its Tuesday morning. Flynn gathers up his dogs and makes his way to the home of Henry Osceola, a Seminole Indian who lived there in the Everglades swamp.It isn't until noon Wednesday that Flynn returns home. He and his wife go immediately to pay a visit to ophthalmologist, Paul R. Brown. Dr. Brown finds Flynn’s vision 20/800 in his right eye, 20/60 in his left eye. He notes a slight bruise over his right brow. The left eye appeared normal, but in the right eye he could not see the retina. Flynn complained of hearing reduction and numbness in his arms and hands following the encounter. Under careful observation and treatment by Dr. Harvie J. Stipe, a physician who had known Flynn for 25 years, Flynn was treated, and soon those symptoms disappeared. On March 26, Flynn, Dr. Stipe, and two others, returned to the encounter site in the Everglades, and there found a burned circle some 72 feet across. The circle looked like it had been swept clean of leaves, twigs, limbs -- normal forest debris. Eight cypress trees were scorched from their tops down to about halfway from the ground. In October 1966, in a phone interview with Arizona physicist James E. McDonald, Flynn stated that the UFO was probably, he figured, some secret aircraft of ours, and that if he could ever prove it then somebody would pay for the good eye he used to have. In July 1996, Flynn made a rare public appearance at Port Charlotte, Florida, where he stated: “I'm waiting for the day someone turns up the truth about this thing.

', 'UFO Landing & Aliens-Brand\'s Flats, Virginia, January 19, 1965 William Blackburn, a resident of Waynesboro, Virginia, was working at the Augusta County Archery Club off Route 250, near Brand\'s Flats, when at approximately 5:40 PM,  on January 19, 1965, he saw two objects in the sky. One of these UFOs, the smaller of the two, descended to the ground and landed approximately 18 yards from the witness. From it emerged three beings of extraordinary appearance, each about three feet high. They were dressed in clothes of the same shiny, peculiar color as the object. One had an extremely long finger on one Band. The beings\' eyes were particularly penetrating: according to the witness, ""they seemed to look through you."" As the creatures approached the witness, to within 12 yards, he froze in fright, a double-edged axe in his hand. After uttering some unintelligible sounds, the beings turned and reentered the object through a door that appeared to ""mold itself into the ship."" The object then ascended and disappeared. Following the appearance of Blackburn\'s account in the local press, the witness told of being visited by members of a government agency whom he would not identify, although he said he was told not to say anything further about his sighting. In an investigation conducted by Richard Hall and several NICAP staff members, strong evidence was found to support the witness\' report of being silenced. In spite of this, the investigators were able to secure some additional details on the sighting. The area of the reported sighting is close to Fishersville, Va., the site of another landing (but with no reported occupants) which had occurred less than a month before. source:http://www.nicap.org/newlook/section_VII.htm', ' ""UFOs,  The Eye and the Camera""Adrian Vance, a former Editor of Popular Photography, wrote the book, ""UFOs, The Eye and the Camera"" that contained a series of photos similar to George Ritter\'s in Ohio. On July 5, 1965, a Barry Andersson took the photo below on the Russian River near Anchorage, Alaska at 6 AM, with his 35 mm camera of a disc shaped craft that he estimated to be 30 feet in diameter.  Adrian Vance writes, ""This picture, with a focal-plane shutter, shows that the disappearance-reappearance mechanism is one that takes place in stages, and that the object begins to appear in the new location while it is still dissolving in the old location or locations.  We use the word \'locations\' since the Andersson photograph also shows that the device can be in several places at one moment, i.e. part in one spot, part in another and so on."" (Page 41). He goes on to speculate that, ""The fact that this machine can dissolve in space and spread itself over several locations indicates that its operators have a very high degree of technology.  This picture demonstrates that the process proceeds from one side of the object to the other, and that in the interval of the Anderson photograph, 1/125 second, the object was in six places.  The fact that they have picked operating cycles that are just beyond human vision indicates that they understand the process in a war, and in terms, that I have not read about before this writing.""

I could find no other UFO reports on this date of any note. Could the unknown objects which were seen earlier on the same day in New Hampshire have flown southwesterly down the Eastern coast of the United States, and moved over the Texas town of Damon?After a few seconds, with the strange object hovering almost directly overhead, they fled the scene and headed toward Damon ""as fast as we could go,"" making speeds of up to 110 miles per hour. McCoy kept watching the object out the rear window of the car. For 10 to 15 seconds, the UFO continued to hover above the pasture. Then it abruptly shot back in the direction from which it had come. ""After arriving at approximately its original position,"" McCoy reported, ""it went straight up in the air and disappeared at 25-30 degrees above the horizon."" Back at Damon, the shaken officers calmed themselves, and then decided to go back and investigate again. This time they drove down the Damon-West Columbia road, but saw nothing. Finally they returned to the area where they had first seen the lights, and once again spied the purple light on the horizon, and again saw the smaller blue light emerge with a strange two-step motion and float upward. Fearing another close encounter, they again fled the area. Goode and McCoy continued on their shift until three or four in the morning, then stopped for breakfast at a cafe. Goode noted that his alligator bite was no longer sore, and when he unwrapped the bandage he discovered that the swelling had gone down and that the wound was nearly healed. Next day, the wound showed virtually no scarring. The deputies reported the sighting to Ellington Air Force Base, and Major Laurence Leach, Jr., arrived on September 8, 1965, to interview McCoy and Goode and take a statement. Leach\'s report to Project Blue Book headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base reflected his puzzlement. ""There is no doubt in my mind,"" he said, ""that they definitely saw some unusual object or phenomenon... Both officers appeared to be intelligent, mature, level-headed persons capable of sound judgment and reasoning.""

Eye witnesses described the unknown object as a ""fireball,"" but it seemed to be under some type of intelligent control, as it veered somewhat in Ohio toward the Quaker State. One of the first official reports of that day came from Frances Kalp, who phoned in her experience to radio station WHJB in Greensburg at 6:30 P.M. She related seeing a fiery object crash into a wooded area near her home in Westmoreland County. Kalp and her children had approached the site within a half-mile, and there they saw an odd object resembling a ""four-pointed star."" Radio station employee John Murphy immediately phoned in the report to the Pennsylvania State Police Department. The Police phoned Kalp and arranged to meet her in Kecksburg. Murphy also raced to the site of the alleged crash. He interviewed Kalp and her children for his report, while the State Police searched the woods for the crashed object. Murphy eagerly awaited the return of the searchers. When they finally completed their search, Murphy was unable to get any clear information from either Carl Metz or Paul Shipco, who headed the search. They only stated that they were calling in the Military to handle the case. Undaunted, Murphy made phone contact with Captain Dussia at State Police Headquarters in Greensburg. Murphy was instructed to visit the office to receive an official statement on the search party results. Upon arriving at headquarters, Murphy noticed that the Military had already arrived in force. Murphy was startled when he received the ""official"" statement; ""The Pennsylvania State Police have made a thorough search of the woods. We are convinced that there is nothing whatsoever in the woods."" By this time, Murphy was convinced that there was a cover-up of some kind. If there was nothing in the woods, why would the Military be in force at Pennsylvania\'s Police headquarters? After turning in his report to the radio station, Murphy overheard one of the policemen involved in the search describing a ""pulsating blue light"" in the forest. Murphy was told that Officer Metz and the Military were going back to the woods, and to his surprise he was given permission to join the second search. Murphy\'s excitement soon turned to disappointment when after accompanying the party to the outskirts of the woods,  he was kept from going any farther. Murphy was an eye witness to the Military sealing off the area, and banning all civilians from the scene and its immediate surroundings. The story of the crash soon made newspapers and television, and the area was quickly overflowing with people wanting to get first hand information on what could possibly be a historic event. What had actually crashed into the woods? Was it just a fragment of a comet? Or space debris reentering the Earth\'s atmosphere? If the explanation was so simple, however, why had the Military cordoned off the area? Could it have been a secret Military craft? Or something far more mysterious?It soon became common knowledge that some eager, interested civilians had made a trip into the woods before the Military gained control of the area. These few individuals were interviewed by Stan Gordon, and told an amazing story. They stated that they saw a copper-bronze colored, saucer-shaped object crashed in the woods. This craft was anywhere from 9-12 feet in length, and bore a gold band around its bottom. Some of the witnesses described writing on the craft which resembled Egyptian hieroglyphics. These few witnesses were quickly whisked away when discovered by Military personnel. Later that night, witnesses claimed that they observed a flatbed truck toting a large object, covered by a tarpaulin. Shortly after the departure of the flatbed, many of the Military personnel vacated the search area. Could this have been a craft from another world being taken down our highways? An extremely intense day of activity was followed by a quiet morning, and it seemed that what had occurred was just a dream. The Air Force concluded their investigation with the ""official"" statement that a meteorite was responsible for the report of a glowing craft, and subsequent crash in the woods. The media as a whole accepted this explanation, and the matter seemed for all intent and purposes, closed. Had it not been for a 1990 television program, the Kecksburg crash would have been just another fancied report by a few overly excited witnesses. The area of Kecksburg would again become a beehive of controversy after a dramatization of the events on ""Unsolved Mysteries"" in 1990. The citizens of the area seemed to be equally divided on the value of airing the segment, with some accepting the ""official"" explanation, and others claiming ""cover-up."" Even before the segment aired, some protesters promoted a petition to stop the network from airing the Kecksburg story. The actual witnesses of the event prevailed, stating that the petitioner\'s list did not include any eye witnesses to the original event. Opposite sides were also taken by those officially investigating the facts of Kecksburg. After the television show ran, two new witnesses came forward. One was a USAF officer at Lockbourne AFB (near Columbus, Ohio). In the early hours of December 10, a truck arrived by the little used back gate of the base and he was ordered to patrol it. It was a flat-bed with a large tarpaulin on the surface covering a conical object. He was told to shoot anyone who tried to get too close. He was advised the truck was bound for Wright Patterson AFB, which is the reputed home of other crashed saucers. The other witness was a building contractor who was asked two days later to take a load of 6,500 special bricks to a hangar inside Wright Patterson. When he sneaked a look inside the hangar he saw a bell-shaped device, some 12 feet high sitting there. Several men wearing white anti-radiation style suits were inspecting the object. After he had been escorted out he was told that he had just seen an object that would become common knowledge in 20 years time, like Pure Garcinia Cambogia which was tested in 1998 and popular until recently. Investigator Robert Young, for one,  became an advocate of the Military\'s official explanation. Stan Gordon, on the other hand, believed the eye witness accounts, and the cover-up theory. Gordon took his findings to the next level, producing a 92 minute documentary video of his findings, titled ""Kecksburg: The Untold Story."" As to be expected, alternative theories were put forward by skeptics and debunkers, such as the reentering of the Russian VENUS probe, but this scenario was rejected by the American and Russian governments. One interesting footnote to this haunting tale came from the widow of John Murphy, who shortly after his death, publicly stated that her husband had been one of the first on the scene, and had actually photographed the strange craft. Supposedly, these valuable snapshots were confiscated by Military officers, and Murphy was instructed not to discuss what he knew, unless he wanted to suffer severe consequences.  In January 1980 UFO investigator Clark McClelland interviewed the assistant fire chief of Kecksburg, James Mayes, and Melvin Reese, another fireman. They reported that their team had come within sixty meters of the object. They had seen an object on the ground that had smashed its way through the trees. Mayes explained how the military had cordoned off the woods and had established a temporary base, complete with telecom link. Fire chief Robert Bitner would later confirm this story. He also said he had seen an object that was about 6 feet high, 6 feet wide, and some 15 feet long, clearly not an aircraft. It was resting at an angle on the ground as if it had impacted nearly horizontally. Another fire officer, \'Pete\', stated he had seen a ring of bumpers around it into which were described some pictorial symbols. In 1990, researcher Stan Gordon from the Pennsylvania Association for the Study of the Unexplained, traced an apparent first-hand witness,  James Romansky. He recalled seeing the object on the ground some 25 years previously, when he was an 18 year old fire fighter.  He had been called to duty that night following concerns that an airplane had crashed. He described the object as bronze coloured and shaped like an acorn-some 12 feet long and 25 feet in diameter;  it had slightly raised ""blunt"" end and strange markings. ""It had writing on it, not like your average writing, but more like ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. It had sort of a bumper on it, like a ribbon about six to 10 inches wide, and it stood out. It was elliptical the whole way around and the writing was on this bumper.It\'s nothing like I\'ve ever seen, and I\'m an avid reader. I read a lot of books on Egypt, the Incas, Peruvians, Russians and I\'ve never to this day come across anything that looked like that."" On 08-29-05, the UFO Casebook received this information from a person who was an eyewitness to the object that soared over Kecksburg.B J, I was on some site about the Kecksburg sighting. It told the story and asked if anyone had an opinion about it. Well, I lived in Pittsburgh at the time that this occurred. Brian Vike wrote about his experience, and when I read it I was floored.  I had forgotten about this ever happening until I watched the Brian Gumbel special. Brian Vike also said he recalled the incident. His sighting and mine are so similar. I was at a drive-in movie that night with my boyfriend. He wanted to get there early to get a good spot. I can\'t remember how long after we arrived there when it happened.  All of a sudden the sky lit up. ""What the heck is that I asked?""The sphere or the ball like object was very low in the sky and was burning and had a long firey tail. The color to me had a greenish color to it. I would say it was in my view for at least 4 seconds, maybe 5 seconds. But of course in those days we thought it was only a meteor. And the next day it was confirmed on the radio it was.  After all these years that have passed it\'s truly amazing to me how much of it I can still remember. Thank you B J,  and getting this computer is wonderful. And know I can relate what I""ve seen, and hope what I will see in the future  I can relate them to you, and everyone else out there that is interested in the UFO phenomenon.FrancineThe Kecksburg crash, in many ways similar to the Roswell case, remains an extremely interesting one, and is still considered ""unsolved."" (B J Booth)', 'Valensole, France Landing, (Masse), 1965 In July of 1965, In Valensole, France, a farmer named Maurice Masse claimed that he saw two children standing in his field. Masse was attempting to find a solution to why his lavender crop had bare spots of ground. As Masse approached the ""children,"" he noticed an unusual object close by. Now with a much closer view, the children were not children at all, but ""strange looking beings."" Masse described them as having large, bald heads, pasty faces, and huge, slanted eyes that stared out at him. He also related that they were wearing coveralls of some sort, and one of them was holding a tube-like device, standing by an odd-looking craft. Masse swore that as he approached the object,  he was hit by some sort of ray, which disabled him for a time. When he awoke, he saw the object flying off into the sky. Fearing ridicule, he was reluctant at first to report his incident, but in time, he came forward with the facts.During an interview, Maurice was shown a drawing representative of an object that had landed in Socorro, New Mexico, the previous year. The object had been seen by policeman Lonnie Zamora, who later made a sketch of it.  Masse remarked, ""Someone else has seen my UFO."" According to the farmer, he was not able to grow anything in the area of the incident for years to come. Neither the Masse nor Zamora case proves the existence of extraterrestrial life, but especially in the Zamora case, there is no doubt that some type of unusual craft with occupants did land, and take off again. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who interviewed Zamora on more than one occasion, believes every word that Zamora said, however, offers no explanation for his sighting. In Hynek\'s own words; ""There is much more evidence to indicate that we are dealing with a most real phenomenon of undetermined origin.""If what Zamora saw was not of extraterrestrial origin, then where did it come from? Why did it land? Who were the strange occupants? (B J Booth)source: Dr. J. Allen Hyneksource: www.nicap.org', ' Flying Disc Lands on Highway, Pretoria, South Africa, 09-16-65 This case was first reported by the Associated Press,  Johannesburg, S. Africa, Sept.17, 1965, and first published in the United States by NICAP. The first information was related by UFO investigator and writer Richard Hall. This case, though not heavy in detail, features a vehicle encounter, UFO landing, and physical traces, along with official secrecy.The events occurred as Constable John Lockem and Koos de Klerek were doing routine patrol on the Pretoria-Bronkhorstspruit road. It was just past midnight when to their utter amazement, the lights on their police van lit up an object ahead of them on the road. Sitting right on the highway was a disc-shaped object. The object was not anything they had seen before.With the object lit up from their headlights, it appeared to be of a copper color, and was about 30 feet in diameter. After only a few seconds, the UFO began to rise above the road, and quickly sped away,  throwing flames from double tubes of some type on the bottom. The two men must have been in awe, wondering from where the strange, unknown object had come from, and where it was going. Later as the men reported their unusual encounter, Constable Lockem stated: ""Its lift-off was quicker than anything I have ever seen."" Flames from the asphalt road had shot up into the air about 3 feet, according to the witnesses. The heat was so intense that the fire lasted for a time, even after the object had zoomed away.Further investigation indicated that parts of the road had caved in, as if from a heavy object resting on it. The gravel had been separated from the tar in an area severely burned about six feet in diameter, indicating the center underneath of the UFO. An official investigation into the incident was carried out by  Lt. Col. J.B. Brits, District Commandant of Pretoria North.In an interview for a local newspaper, Brits told reporters that the case of the UFO landing was considered ""as being of a highly secret nature and an inquiry is being conducted in top circles."" Samples of the damaged road material were taken by a scientific agency for analysis, but the results were never released to the public. Because of the location of the event, and its age, it is unlikely that more information will be forthcoming. The case remains unexplained.original report by Richard Hall Source: UFOs: A New Look (NICAP 1969); Associated Press, Johannesburg, S. Africa, Sept.17, 1965.

1961, ,"['UFOs & Water Case, Eagle River, Wisconsin 1961 On April 18, just six days after Yury Gagarin became the first person to orbit the Earth, and while the Bay of Pigs invasion was disintegrating, a strange UFO encounter allegedly took place at Eagle River, Wisconsin. At 11 a.m., Joe Simonton claimed to hear a whining sound and then saw a craft, thirty feet in diameter and twelve feet high, resting on his property. A man about five feet tall appeared from the craft; he wore a black, turtleneck pullover with a white band at the belt and black trousers with a vertical white band along the side. Inside the craft, Simonton discerned two more figures; he said all three resembled ""Italians."" The strange man held up a metallic jug, which Simonton took and filled with water. He noticed one man frying on a flameless grill and motioned for some food. He received three ordinary pancakes or cookies, about three inches in diameter, perforated with small holes. Soon after, the craft departed. The air force investigated the case and even analyzed the pancakes, finding them to be entirely ordinary, except for the lack of any salt. The case was inconclusive: nothing ever pointed to a hoax, but little evidence supported anything more.source and references:UFOs and the National Security State by Richard Dolan, pp. 247-8, © 2002 ', 'The Betty and Barney Hill Abduction, Part 1When I was but a young boy, the only time anyone talked about flying saucers was after watching a movie about them, or seeing an episode of Twilight Zone, or Science Fiction Theater. Then one morning, I was scanning over our local newspaper, and noticed about three pages deep this heading, ""New Hampshire Couple Encounters UFO."" Well, needless to say, I was intrigued. In our small town paper, you just didn\'t see things on this type of subject. As I began to read the article, I was astounded to see that these two people claimed to have been abducted by aliens, and taken inside the ship! Well, that was enough for me to think, ""What is this, some kind of joke?"" I thought I had heard the last of it, but I had not. Soon, this story became an international one, and even today, is still considered one of the most believable, and certainly most researched UFO cases, except for maybe the Roswell incident. One thing about this whole subject that seems odd to me, is that it is considered within the realm of possibility that someone could see a UFO, but for someone to be taken aboard one, NO WAY. In 1961, Barney Hill was a 39-year-old black man who worked for the US Postal Service. His wife Betty was a 41-year-old white woman, who owned a Master\'s Degree, and was the supervisor for the child welfare department. The fact that the Hills were an interracial couple has been given weight by some who state that Barney was suffering stress in dealing with some public ridicule about the black and white union, which was not nearly as readily accepted in the early 1960s as it is today. In my research into Mr. Hill\'s life, I can\'t find any reason for his stress being the cause of telling such an incredible story. What ensued after the couple went public with their story was much more stressful to him than any anti-racial remarks he may have encountered.The story of Betty and Barney Hill begins in September 1961, in the state of New Hampshire. Barney had recently developed an ulcer, and he and his wife Betty decided to take a short vacation to Canada. The couple had visited Niagara Falls, and Montreal, and on the 19th of the month, they began their journey back home to Portsmouth. The night was clear, with a crescent moon shining on the heavily wooded landscape that surrounded US Route 3 in the central part of New Hampshire. At about a quarter past 10:00 PM, three miles south of the city of Lancaster, Barney noticed what appeared to be a bright star, or planet, which seemed to move erratically. Barney pointed this out to Betty, and they both began to keep track of the object.The couple began to believe that they were watching a plane appear and disappear, as the movement of their vehicle caused the trees to come and go in obstructing their view. Later, Barney would state that he tried to convince himself that the object was a plane, but that Betty thought it to be something else - an unidentified craft of some kind. As the two continued to the Flume, just north of North Woodstock, the object appeared to move in an odd way. As they reached Indian Head, Barney actually stopped the car to have a look at the object with his binoculars. He saw multi-colored lights, and rows of windows on a flat-shaped object, which now seemed to be moving toward him. As the object moved to within a hundred feet of him, he could see occupants inside. Frightened, he ran back to his car where Betty waited. They climbed inside and sped away. Soon, two hours of their lives would vanish into oblivion.After resuming their journey home, they were not able to see the strange craft anymore. Oddly though, they heard a beeping sound. They then heard the beeping a second time, noticing that they were suddenly thirty-five miles farther down the road than a minute or two ago. They were now in Ashla. The mood in the car was quiet as they proceeded home and went to bed. They both slept until the next afternoon. When Betty got up, she called her sister Janet, and told her what had happened. Janet told her to call nearby Pease Air Force Base, and report what she had seen. Betty reported the incident, speaking to Major Paul W. Henderson, who told Betty; ""The UFO was also confirmed by our radar."" It is important to note at this point that Barney was against calling the sighting in to the base, hoping to keep it quiet.At this time, neither Betty nor Barney recalled any abduction. Soon, however, Betty began having nightmarish dreams of her and her husband being taken aboard a craft of some kind, against their will. In a matter of weeks, two writers got wind of the story, and after interviewing the Hills, made an intensive log of the events of the night. They discovered that there were two hours of unaccounted time in the Hill\'s story, even allowing for stops for the Hills, and breaks for their dog, who also had made the trip with them. Another interesting note that I should interject here is that these ""two writers,"" which are mentioned in almost every report of this incident, (and there are literally thousands of them), have not been named, or I cannot find their names. However, the story is true, because their interview was attended by Major James MacDonald, a former Air Force Intelligence Officer. Shortly after Betty began having these disturbing dreams, she wrote a letter to Major Donald Kehoe, who passed her information on to one Walter Webb, who was on the staff of the Hayden Planetarium. Webb, at the time, was a scientific advisor for the National Investigations Committee on Arial Phenomena (commonly referred to as NICAP). What he did with the report is unknown. It was Major MacDonald who made the suggestion to the Hills that regressive hypnosis might account for the two hours of missing time. In the spring of 1962, the Hills contacted a psychiatrist about the hypnosis sessions, but decided to put it off for a time. All the while, Betty was still haunted by the dreams, and Barney\'s ulcer was worse, and he was again suffering from hypertension. After dodging reporters, and doing some research on psychiatrists, the Hills made a decision to contact well-known Boston psychiatrist and neurologist, Dr. Benjamin Simon, who was one of the most respected doctors in his field. After a couple of initial interviews, Dr. Simon\'s preliminary diagnosis was ""anxiety syndrome,"" relating to the incidents of the night of September 19, 1961. His next step was to find out what those events were.B J Booth']"
1963, ,"['1963, The Wayne City, Illinois Car Chase August 4, 1963, Nr. Wayne City, Illinois  Investigated by Indiana Unit No. 1, NICAP After a long UFO ""dry spell"" in the U.S., a sudden rash of sightings in 1963 in S. Illinois prompted the investigation by our NICAP team. The primary event of 1963 occurred on the Sunday evening of August the 4th, at about 11:30 PM, at Wayne City, Illinois.  Although a little out of our territory (about 75 miles away and out of state), it was urgent that we respond. There were no NICAP FI\'s anywhere in S. Illinois.  Because of jobs, we had to wait a few days until the weekend.  By Saturday evening we were on our way to Wayne City.  Accompanying me on the investigation were James Catt (Communications Officer) and Phillip Studler (Public Relations).  Phil had contacted the news media and the Wayne County Sheriff\'s Office and arranged the interview. We interviewed the witnesses to the Uphoff-Hill case first, there in Fairfield, then made a trip over to the Austin home in rural Keenes, Illinois, nearby.  It was getting late.  Here is what we found:   A week earlier, a young man, Ronnie Austin and his girlfriend, Phyllis Bruce (both 18) had driven to Mt. Vernon, Illinois, to attend a drive-in movie, ""The Great Escape"". At around 11:30 PM they departed on Route 15 heading east for home, which was Wayne City. Phyllis had gotten angry with him, and as they drove along past the airport, Ronnie leaned over to speak to her. As he did this, he glanced out of the window to the south and saw a  big white object moving along at treetop level, about 20-degrees above the horizon to the southwest.  He described it as fuzzy and about the size of a washtub. Both witnesses watched, casually talking about the light for several minutes.   Then they discovered that the light seemed to be keeping pace with them. Ronnie reported that when he speeded the car up, the object seemed to speed up. Also, when he decelerated, the object seemed to slow down, too. This continued, as indicated by the  map included in this report. At first the light was on the south side of the car; then it crossed over in front to the north side. The transition took place when they were about 6 miles west of the Orchardville Road intersection. The object had been on their right (south) and keeping up with them, when all at once the object headed for the car. It appeared to get within a few hundred feet and then it suddenly gained altitude and stopped for several seconds over an electronic relay tower. Then the light shot across the road to the north side to the left of the car. It maintained this position for a while about 500 feet distant.  They then turned north on the gravel road leading to Phyllis\' home, which was approximately 1.5 miles away. The object was now on their right. Upon arrival, Phyllis\' sister Forestine came outside to observe the thing, which was now in the southeast. The object appeared to move closer, so went inside, turned out the lights and watched through a window. After 15 minutes had passed, Ronnie decided he had better go home. He made a run for the car. As soon as he pulled away from the Bruce home, the object began to follow. In our interview with the boy\'s father (Orville) on August 12, he told us that this is what scared Ronnie, the thought that the UFO was waiting for him to be alone before it took off after him. He had to head south and the object was on his left now. When he turned east onto another gravel road, the object suddenly shot diagonally ahead of him over a barn about a mile away, just beyond the T-road. The object now changed from a brilliant white to a duller or dimmer light with an orange tinge.   Ronnie said he ""really poured the coal"" to the car and must have been doing 120 mph when he topped the hill on the gravel road. Then, he reported, the object flared bright orange and came straight toward him at high speed. It hovered over the car, within 100\'. Just before it hovered it had swerved upward and Ronnie judged its size as that of an automobile. At the point right over the car his radio (tuned to WLS) went crazy with static, which was described as a loud whining sound.. At that time he noticed a ""cooling effect"". The object made another pass at the car, this time west to east, and at this point where the object was again overhead, the engine of the car started missing. The object proceeded back to its position over the barn, hovered, changed to a duller orange. This small road running east to west is only about a mile long and the events that took place according to the witness indicates an increase in activity by the object, which really had the boy scared by now.   Ronnie now turned north at the intersection (extension of road not shown) and headed for home which was over 3 miles away. The object followed him again. As he headed west down the lane leading to his home, the object cut across the road behind him to the left. He spun his car around in the driveway in front of the house, got out of the car and ran inside. The object was now above another farmhouse in the east about 300 yards away.   When Ronnie woke his parents, they thought he had gone crazy. He told them that ""it"" had chased him home. He could hardly talk; every third or fourth word would trail off. Mr. Austin thought that somebody had chased the boy and was trying to hurt him, so he grabbed the shotgun as he went out the door. Ronnie told him that it wouldn\'t do any good. Orville Austin told us that when he saw the object hovering over the field, he understood what the boy was trying to say. He put the gun down. The object started to move closer again so they went into the kitchen and turned out the lights, watching through the windows. Mr. Austin felt that the object was attracted by the lights. Then Ronnie told him to call the police. Orville tried but the phone was dead. Later, the phone was operating and he called Fairfield Police. He said that they thought he was joking. He wanted them to contact Scott Air Force Base which was 80 miles to the northwest. It was about l2:25 A.M. now.   At this time Ronnie\'s parents saw that he needed medical aid. They called Dr. Konarski of Fairfield and he told them what to give him. When the police arrived, they saw the ""object"", too. Several friends and neighbors watched this ""object"" and at one time Ronnie got scared and ran back into the house. Several buddies of Ronnie\'s watched an object until 4:00 in the morning.   In all there were six witnesses of the original UFO: Ronnie, Phyllis, Orville, Ronnie\'s mother, Ronnie\'s sister Roxie, and his brother (name unknown).  The total sighting time was 50-minutes. The other observers probably never saw the UFO; but probably the morning star.   The above report was derived from corrected versions of the WAYNE COUNTY PRESS, our interview with Ronnie\'s father, and story by Jeffrey Liss (FATE).   The following day, August 5th, the WAYNE COUNTY PRESS interviewed Ronnie. His parents were not at home; he was alone. The press report and report by Mr. Orville Austin differ in several ways. Orville stated to me that the WAYNE COUNTY PRESS had ""put words in the boy\'s mouth"".   On Saturday, August 10th, after being interrogated by ASSOCIATED PRESS and FATE magazine, Ronnie was interrogated by the Air Force team. The team of physicists was made up of three men: Lt. Col. Robert J. Friend (Director of PROJECT BLUE BOOK), Captain Hector Quintanilla (later the longest-term PROJECT BLUE BOOK Director), and Sgt. Charles P. Sharp.   According to our interview with Orville Austin, the boy was instructed to wash the car. The officers then appeared to be decontaminating the inside of the automobile. After this was done, the car was checked for what we thought at that time was radioactivity. Later, I thought that it might have been a magnetic signature check, but I found that no special magnetic device is used for this...simply a magnetic compass. The ""readings"" called off and remembered by the Austin family were as follows: ""Six point something for the front of the car...four point something for the top of the auto...""   Orville said that his younger boy (name unknown, to this investigator) had been there during the check and would vouch for the rough figures. Within a half-an-hour the boy showed up and confirmed the figures without a hint. I was amazed. He even added a ""two point something for the trunk area""...   At that time I was a Civil Defense radiological monitor. Many years later I had moved from Vincennes and finally located in Mt. Vernon, Indiana, where I became a county RADEF Officer and, I guess that\'s one reason why I felt the case should be re-opened or at least relayed to MUFON & CUFOS. It appears there was radioactivity present for these reasons:   a) Readings of counts per minute average 16-30, depending on locale. You wouldn\'t get the wide difference of 6-4-2 under normal conditions and even then the readings were too low.   b) Roentgens per hour would indicate a high dose-rate, something expected after a nuclear attack has subsided, etc., very high. I don\'t believe for a minute that this was the interpretation.   c) Milliroentgens per hour is more likely and possibly the only answer if we take the testimony seriously. This corresponds with the dose-rate observed by the ""rockhounds"" mentioned in Captain Ruppelt\'s book, ...1OO times normal.   Although this is heresay and we never did get a signed report of any kind, I still believe the report warrants further study. Although the Austins\' at the time (1963) were really tired of the whole thing, I believe we could contact them (especially Ronnie) and get a signed and corrected report.   The Orville Austin interview produced several other findings:   a) Ronnie\'s car was capable of very high speed, ""easily could peg 100"". Orville doesn\'t believe he was going that fast. I believe the loose gravel gave false mph at high (but short) acceleration. In any case, Orville said that he and the boy knew the road too well to take that kind of a risk, normally.  b) Mr. Austin was convinced the object was something unusual...not natural. He saw it from the front porch. Mr. Austin\'s father told him that he would not have been afraid of it and his son told him that, something to the effect, ""Oh yes you would (have been scared)...it did look horrible"".  c) Ignition interference was discussed. Mr. Austin did not confirm the fact that the object seemed to cause the E-M effect. It was mentioned in the WAYNE COUNTY PRESS articles. The only thing we have is the statement that the car was in top shape and  the press report of the car sputtering and missing... almost died when object made a pass. Ronnie allegedly made the statement also to the FATE MAGAZINE reporter, Jeffrey Lies. I believe this effect was observed and reported accurately. Mr. Austin may not have realized the significance.  d) Radio interference was confirmed by Phyllis Bruce (WAYNE COUNTY PRESS article), Mr. Austin, and the FATE reporter. Mr. Liss believes the area is ""noisy"" anyway, from his experience during the investigation he conducted. However, the burst of static occurred when the object made the first good pass at Ronnie, within an estimated 100\'. This is when it zoomed toward him and swerved up over his car. This is where Ronnie estimated the object\'s size of a small automobile.  a) Telephone interference was noted. This came from Orville, himself.  f) The ""cooling effect"" was confirmed by Mr. Austin as an accurate statement made by the boy. It was stated later that it was possible that Ronnie had a sudden chill. Again, this should be viewed as a physiological effect, in any case, since it deals with reaction to stimuli.  g) The ""whirring sound"" was correctly reported. This was during the passes.  h) Ronnie had really needed sedation. Not only his father (and family) noticed this, but Trooper Gidcumb and Marshall Sexton, and others. He was so keyed up that he reportedly ran inside when others saw a star ""they"" thought was a UFO.  i) Mr. Austin felt that he and the family saw a real UFO and that it disappeared before the other people got to the scene.  3) The radiation angle came out of our talk with Orville and his other son. Nobody else seems to have reported the incident of the Air Force men taking readings. I still believe that the car was indicating an abnormal reading, then. Our checks showed normal readings. I doubt that radiation would linger for a week and then abruptly drop off to normal in a couple of days. It is a gradual, but steadily increasing process. Maybe this means something; maybe it wasn\'t a radiation device used to check the car.  k) Statement by Mr. Austin that Ronnie always ran around with a group of boys at night, but since the incident he has been afraid to leave the house. On the previous Thursday (4 days after the incident) the boys had asked him to come out; he had refused.  1) The dogs barked all night.  This unknown is listed as a CE-2 with E-M effects on car radio, car engine, speedometer, and telephone.   The 1956 Ford Victoria was equipped with a magnetic speedometer which was probably giving false speed reading due to the UFO\'s E-M effects. This case was investigated by our NICAP Subcommittee AND a team of Air Force Project Blue Book physicists.  Evidence gathered by the Air Force indicates that the car was slightly radioactive or magnetized.  This was determined by the type of readings called off by members of the AF team as the family watched and listened.   An interesting historical note for the record, the Air Force team consisted of three men.  These were Lt. Col. Robert J. Friend, then the Director of Project Blue Book; Capt. Hector Quintanilla, and Sgt. Charles R. Sharp.  Later in the year or early in 1964, Quintanilla became the Project Director.  The AF, and especially Quintanilla, were ridiculing many witnesses who claimed sightings of UFOs.  The ""explanation"" issued after the investigation was ""a refueling operation"" or the ""planet Venus"".  The AF must have considered this case important.  They had flown in the special team of physicists from Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.  Normally, when investigating a case, they would send the local ""UFO officer"" from the nearest airbase. In this case it would have been Scott AFB at Belleville, Illinois (near St. Louis).  Something strange was going on in the midwest, and AF Intelligence was interested in something that ""didn\'t exist.""  A quick check would have eliminated a refueling operation and the need for an onsite.

2059, ,"[""NAVIGATIONThe information that you are about to read, about a UFO incident, was  supplied to Vangard  Sciences by Mr.Warren York. This  information was  obtained through the government Freedom of Information Act.This UFO incident allegedly occurred at Alsworth AFB in South Dakota, about 7 miles southwest of Nisland, Dakota. At 2059hrs., 16 Nov. 1977, Airmen 1C  Phillips,  Lt.  A.Lims  Security  Control, telephone WSC. reported an O2 alarm activation at L-9.   Lims SAT  #1,  A-1C  Jenkins  &  A-1C  Raeke were dispatched, (Trip #62, ETA  2135hrs.)  At 2147hrs., A-1C Phillips telephones WSC and reported that the situation at  L-9 had been upgraded to a COVERED WAGON PER REQUEST OF Capt. Stokes, Larry  D., FSO.  Security Option 11 was initiated by WSC and Base CSC.  BAF (Backup  Security  Force) #1&&2, was  formed.  At  2340hrs.,  16  Nov.  77,  the  following  information was  learned:  Upon  arrival  (2132hrs.)  at  Site  #L-9.  LSAT.  Jenkins &  Raeke, dismounted the SAT vehicle to make a  check  of  the  site  fence line.  At this  time Raeke observed a bright light shinning vertically upwards form  the rear of the fence line of L-9. (There is a small hill approximately 50  yards behind L-9)  Jenkins stayed with the SAT vehicle and Raeke proceeded to the source of the  light to investigate. As Raeke approached the crest of the hill, he observed  an individual dressed in a glowing, green metallic uniform and wearing  a  helmet with visor.  Raeke immediately challenged the individual, however; the individual refused  to stop and kept walking towards the rear fence line of L-9. Raeke aimed his  M-16 rifle at the intruder and ordered him to stop.  The intruder turned towards Raeke and aimed a object at him which emitted  a bright flash of intense light. The  flash of light struck Raeke's M-16  rifle, disintegrating the weapon and causing second and third degree burns  to his hands.  Raeke immediately took cover and concealment and radioed the situation to  Jenkins, who in turn radioed a 10-13  distress to Line  Control.  Jenkins  responded to Raeke's position and carried Raeke back to  the SAT vehicle.  Jenkins then returned to the rear fence line to stand guard.  Jenkins observed  two intruders dressed in the same uniforms, walk through  the rear fence line of L-9. Jenkins challenged the two individuals, but they  refused to stop. Jenkins aimed and fired two rounds from his M-16 rifle.  One bullet struck one intruder in the back and one bullet struck one  intruder in  the  helmet.  Both  intruders  fell to the ground,  however,  approximately 15 seconds later, Jenkins took cover and the light missed  Jenkins.  The two intruders returned to the east side of the hill and disappeared.  Jenkins followed the two and observed them go inside a saucer shaped object  approximately 20' in diameter and 20' thick. The  object  emitted  a glowing  greenish light.  Once the intruders were inside, the object climbed vertically upwards  and  disappeared over  the  Eastern  horizon.   BAF #1  arrived  at the site at  2230hrs., and set up a security perimeter. Site Survey Team arrived at the  site (0120hrs.) and took radiation readings, which measured  from 1.7 to 2.9  roentgens.  Missile Maintenance examined the missile and warhead, and found the nuclear  components missing from the warhead.  Col.  Speaker,  Wing Cmdr. arrived at  the site and set up an investigation.  A completed follow-up  report of this  incident will be submitted by order of Col. Speaker.  FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION: Raeke was treated at the base hospital for second and  third degree radiation burns to each hand.  Raeke M-16 rifle could not be located at the site.""]"
1962, ,"['The Las Vegas UFO Crash,  April 18, 1962 Very few of the crash/retrieval stories take place on a military reservation. The majority of the reports are from civilians who have happened onto the scene of an extraordinary event. The reported destruction of a craft near Nellis Air Force Base, outside of Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1962 is the exception that proves the rule. The vast Nellis complex is the one location where it seems a flying saucer crashed right into government and air force hands. And there are, literally, dozens of firsthand witnesses to the fact.  Like many of the reports of UFO crashes, the Las Vegas case was overlooked by most of the UFO research community. Frank Edwards, who mentioned the Roswell case in a single paragraph in his 1966 book Flying Saucers-Serious Business, wrote more about the crash near Las Vegas in his 1964 book Strange World. Although he often wrote from memory and didn\'t always check his facts as closely as possible, he did get the basics of the case reported before anyone else bothered with it.  According too him, an object sighted over Oneida, New York, was headed to the west. There were reports from Kansas and Colorado, and indications of something near the ground outside of Eureka, Utah. Something bright enough to later light up the streets of Reno, Nevada, like the noonday sun, and then turn toward Las Vegas, far to the south and hack to the east. It flared brightly and disappeared from the Nellis Air Force Base radar scopes at ten thousand feet.   This was an object seen by thousands as it crossed the country on the evening of April 18, 1962.  The air force and debunkers quickly wrote it off as a bolide, a meteor so bright that it could light the darkened ground like the afternoon sun. That is, the reported explanation is of a natural phenomenon that is rare, interplanetary, but certainly not under intelligent control.  Edwards claimed that only one newspaper carried anything about the exploding object. The Las Vegas Sun had printed the story, and Edwards, without interviewing a single witness himself, had used that as the basis for his report.  The April 19 edition of the Sun reported BRILLIANT RED EXPLOSION FLARES IN LAS VEGAS SKY. Their story left no doubt about what had happened and the many witnesses to it. In the lead paragraph, Jim Stalmaker, a reporter for the Las Vegas Sun, told of a flaming sword that started a ground search for a weird unidentified flying object that had the air force on alert in several states.   A spokesman for the North American Air Defense Command in Colorado Springs. Colorado, Lieutenant Colonel Herbert Rolph, told reporters that the first observers, in the Oneida, New York, area, had seen a glowing red ball heading to the west. It was at great altitude, made no sound, and disappeared in seconds.  Radar picked up the object, and operators watched it as it streaked into the Midwest. The Air Defense Command alerted a number of bases, including Nellis in Las Vegas. Reports indicate that fighters were scrambled from Luke Air Force Base near Phoenix. In Nephi, Utah, according to the Las Vegas Sun, witnesses reported the glowing red object flew overhead. When it was gone, there was a rumbling like that of jet engines.  Edwards thought it might have been from the engines of the interceptors as they chased the UFO. Then, according to the reports, the UFO came down near Eureka, Utah, interrupting electrical service from a power plant close to the landing site. It took off a few minutes later, continuing to the west.It was seen over Reno, Nevada, apparently made a sweeping turn to the south, and then disappeared from the radar screens east of the strip where most of the  places to stay in Las Vegas are now located.   The Clark County, Nevada, sheriff\'s office was swamped with phone calls about the explosion. Witnesses said the object was traveling almost horizontally northeast of Las Vegas until the final explosion from the direction of Mesquite, Nevada.   Sheriff\'s deputy Walter Bun, who led the search and rescue unit, moved the unit into the Spring Mountain area in jeeps to search for wreckage.  In a phone interview conducted in November 1988 Butt told me they searched through the night, and when the sun came up they continued, using aircraft. They didn\'t find anything of importance, except some ashes that could easily have been the remains of a campfire started by a hunter weeks earlier. When no one reported a downed or missing aircraft, Bun and the other deputies called off the search.   Also mentioned in the Las Vegas Sun story was Frank Maggio, a staff photographer Using the Las Vegas telephone directory, I looked up Frank Maggio. There was no listing for him, but there was a Maggio Photo Lab. Thinking it had to be the same person, I called. It was.  He couldn\'t add anything to the story that had appeared in the paper. He described the UFO as a ""tremendous flaming sword."" There was a series of bright explosions that broke up the trail across the sky. It vanished east of Las Vegas.   The next step seemed obvious. In 1969 the air force had announced the closing of Project Blue Book, the official UFO investigation. Six or seven years later, the Blue Book files were declassified, and anyone who could get to Maxwell Air Force Base near Montgomery, Alabama, could do research in them. Not long after that, they were transferred to the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and put on microfilm. Anyone with the resources could buy copies of them. Ninety- six rolls of microfilm at $22 a roll. All I had to do was check in the Blue Book files and see what they had to say about the case.  0n April 18, according to the Blue Book files, there was a radar sighting at Nellis Air Force Base that was at first labeled as ""Unidentified"" but later changed to ""Insufficient Data for a Scientific Analysis."" On the Project Record Card (ATIC FORM 329) the case was summarized as a:  ""Radar sighting. Speed of object varied. (Important to note that] Initial observation at 060, no elevation. Disappearance at 105 [degrees] az [at] 10,000 feet altitude. Heading tentatively NE, however disappeared instantly to S. Observed by search and height radars. \'No visual.""   That last statement was ridiculous. No visual sighting, except for all those people in Las Vegas who called the sheriff\'s office. No visual, except for Frank Maggio, who reported the fiery end to the object. No visual, except Walter Butt who led a search party into the desert to look for wreckage.  I continued to search the file, looking for a reference to the sighting from the Eureka, Utah, area: information that was available to the Las Vegas Sun, but not in the official air force file about the sighting near Nellis.  The master index showed no sighting in Utah on April 18, but did list a meteor on April 19.  (Later notes in the file itself confirm the April 18 date.) The Project Record Card claimed: ""Object came in over Cuba and apparently landed in rough terrain West of Eureka, Utah. Bright enough to trip photo electric cell which controlled city street lights.""   They also note, ""Multiple rpts. Attempted recovery by Col. Friend and Dr. Hynek."" They finish by noting the explanation is ""Astro, probably meteor.""   There was a file folder available, but it was not filed where it should have been but stuck at the end of the April 1962 section. Included in it were a number of reports by military officers made shortly after the incident.According to Captain Herman Gordon Shields, who was interrogated at Hill Air Force Base by Douglas M. Crouch, the chief of the criminal investigation sections:    I was flying a C-119 aircraft from the left seat [captain\'s seat]. We were approximately two miles west of La Van, Utah flying at 8500 feet MSL. Our true airspeed was a little less than 170 knots. We were making a right turn from a heading of about 068 degrees to 165 degrees. We were approximately 25 degrees of bank on the aircraft and we had turned for about 30 degrees to a heading of about 098 or 100 degrees, somewhere in there, when it began to get very bright in the, cockpit. The illumination was from above. It built up slowly. My first impression while the intensity was low was that it was the landing lights of another aircraft. Of course, when the intensity increased this was ruled out automatically. The cockpit was illuminated from above. In the C-119 aircraft there is an instrument panel in the middle of the cockpit up above on the ceiling of the cockpit. The light source was coming from this area that was blanked out, in other words, straight behind this instrument panel because neither Lieutenant Larson, who was in the fight seat nor I saw the source of the illumination. We continued the turn. The light intensity increased until we could see objects [on the ground] as bright as day for a radius of five to ten miles from the aircraft. This would probably be a diameter of twenty miles or so. Objects on the ground, on the hills around us, were clearly distinguishable. Colors were distinguishable. It was as bright as daylight. The intensity of the light diminished faster than it had increased. After the light had decreased in intensity we were still looking for the light source, and I noticed an object to my left between the wing and the lower part of the fuselage of the aircraft against the hills. By this time the light had decreased so that the hills were dark. It was night again. And this object which I saw was illuminated. It had a long slender appearance comparable to a cigarette in size, that is, the diameter with respect to the length of the object. The fore part, or the lower part of the object was very bright, intense white such as a magnesium fire. The second half, the aft section, was a clearly distinguishable yellowish color. I would say the object was just about divided in half, the fore part being intensely white, the aft section having a more yellow color to it.  Later in the same report, Captain Shields said, ""I saw only a slender object. I don\'t know what the shape was. It was only a slender object ... There was no exhaust, no trail following after it. It was clearly defined. I saw it for a period of maybe one to two seconds.""   Also available in the Eureka file was an unclassified intelligence report that ran to seven single-spaced pages on legal- sized sheets. Many of the witnesses reported only a ball of fire passing overhead. They reported a series of explosions after the object was gone (sonic booms?) and a trail of gray smoke.   A man in Silver City, Utah (name blanked out by air force officers in 1976) claimed that the object was a glowing ball of light about the size of a soccer ball. He said it was white with a yellowish tint and a bright yellow jagged flame coming from the rear (confirming the description of Captain Shields). The unidentified witness claimed:    As the object passed over Robinson [Utah), it slowed down in [the] air, and after, [a] gasping sound was heard, the object spurted ahead again. After this procedure was repeated three or four times, the object arched over and began descending to earth after which the object turned bluish color and then burned out or went dark. After the object began to slow down it began to wobble or ""flshtail"" in its path. At the end of the report, Crouch wrote:    The preparing officer is Chief Criminal Investigator, OS-9, Security and Law Enforcement Division, Hill Air Force Base, Utah. Preliminary analysis indicates that each of the observers interviewed were logical, mature persons, and that each person was convinced that he had observed some tangible object, not identifiable as a balloon or conventional type aircraft. The theory that the object was a manned aircraft was abandoned due to the described shape and color and flaming tail of the object, plus the fact there are no reports of missing aircraft in this area. No unusual meteorological or astronomical conditions were present which would furnish an explanation for the sighting. No missile test firings are conducted in the immediate area other than static tests. The hypotheses that the object was a falling meteor is questioned due to the statements of three observers describing the flat trajectory, plus the description of sounds emanating from the object. Due to the inaccessibility of the valley, ten miles wide by 15 miles long in which the object apparently came to earth, no further search for the object is contemplated. With the completion of this initial report, no explanation has been developed for the brilliant illumination of the area, the object itself, or the explosion in the wake of the object.  The final report was signed by Douglas M. Crouch and by Major Charles W. Brion, chief, Sec. and Law Enforcement Division, both at Hill Air Force Base, Utah.  Air force investigation of the sighting had also showed that the object came down near Eureka, Utah. An orange, glowing object that was bright enough to shut off the photoelectric cells had been reported in that area.   But even with the conclusions drawn by the first investigators of the sightings, the air force sent J. Allen Hynek and Lieutenant Colonel Robert Friend to Utah on May 8, 1962. Crouch accompanied them on their investigation. They spent ""one full day"" tracking down the witnesses in central Utah. (25) At the end of the day they decided that the residents had seen a very rare phenomenon known as a bolide. (26) That would be the end of the case.  Later Friend, writing to ""Hq USAF, SAFOI-3b [Major Hart]"" reported:    The number of reports generated by the 18 April 1962 sighting, and the fact that the Air Force investigation came to a negative conclusion regarding the UFO, they indicated it couldn\'t have been a meteor (Attachment #1), prompted further investigation by FTD [Foreign Technology Division]... This investigation was completed in one full day and it was concluded that the object was a bolide. An attempt was made to locate the object but this effort failed due to the general nature of the data. Further study of this sighting indicates that the meteor probably struck in the area of the Wasatch National Forest; however, the Air Force has made no further at tempts to recover it. Friend\'s statement, the fact that he and Hynek went to the area, and the absence of conflicting data suggest that the most likely explanation is the one they offered. In fact, Dr. Robert Kadesch, an associate professor of physics at the University of Utah, confirmed that view with me. Also quoted in several area newspapers, Kadesch said, simply, it ""probably was a bolide."" But the official air force file, Friend\'s letter, and Kadesch\'s statements are not the whole story of the Utah end of this case. Interviews I conducted with the principals in the case create more questions than they answer. And the newspaper reports create an interesting enigma. According to the Nevada State Journal, the object flew over Reno, passing west to east. Yet the witnesses in Utah universally claim the object was traveling from the southeast to the northwest. At some point the UFO seems to have reversed its course, and a meteor wouldn\'t do that.  Among the first to sight the object was Sheriff Raymond Jackson of Nephi. According to him, he was on Main Street and ""heard kind of a roar."" He glanced up and saw a yellow-white flame going west, heard a series of loud booms, and saw the lights in Nephi go out. Jackson noticed specifically the lights in the doctor\'s office, but said, ""All the lights went out temporarily."" That would become an important clue when the rest of the case was put together.  Also in the Nephi area were Maurice Memmott and Dan Johnson. According to a story published in the Nephi Times News, both men were south of town, working on their farms, when the object shot overhead.  Memmott claims that he no longer remembers much about the incident, just a bright light in the sky that lit the ground like the sun. He told me that he now believes that it was a meteor. Dan Johnson, on the other hand, remembers the event quite well. He. said, ""The two of us were out in the fields ... there were no lights so we were in total darkness."" It came over the southeastern horizon and passed directly over them. ""It was a very bright light."" Johnson didn\'t remember hearing any sound, but did claim that the object landed somewhere in the northwest. He didn\'t think it was more than five or six miles away.  Johnson also said that several men -- he thought they might have been military though none were in uniform -- came out to interview both Memmott and him. The men drove them back out into the country and made them point to the location where the object landed. The Times-News confirmed Johnson\'s story of the investigation and added an interesting note. The speculation was that the investigators were not from the air force, but soldiers from the army\'s Dugway Proving Grounds not that far from the area. Tracking the dates supplied by Friend\'s report and the information available from the Times-News, it seems that the conclusion is correct. Two separate teams of investigators made the rounds in Nephi after the events. And a few people remembered talking to Colonel Friend and Dr. Hynek. Friend, it seems, was in uniform during the one day he was there. There is no way that the two teams could have been confused.  Sergeant E. C. Sherwood of the Utah Highway Patrol was also in Nephi that evening. He looked up in time to see the ball of fire and thought that it was something from New Mexico\'s White Sands Missile Range. It was a bright light that was mostly blue and it seemed to explode right over him, throwing off a cloud of white sparks. Sherwood\'s wife heard the explosion and ran outside. She saw the bright light but nothing beyond that. She mentioned to me that the neighbors were also outside, looking up into the night sky. A number of other residents in Nephi reported the explosions or the roar. Some of them explained that it was a series of explosions, twenty or thirty of them strung together Their descriptions ran from a rocket\'s engine to an artillery shell flying over. From Nephi, the object traveled to the northwest, toward Eureka, Which is about thirty miles away. It flew over Bob Robinson and Floyd Evans. According to Robinson, they were traveling south of Eureka when they stopped for a moment and climbed out of their pickup truck. Robinson saw the light in the southeast and pointed it out. Evans thought that it was a jet aircraft.The object approached them rapidly and passed directly overhead. Robinson said that he thought it was no higher than five hundred feet. It was a flaming object, and he thought he could see a series of square windows on the craft almost hidden in the glow of it.  Robinson said that both men were frightened by the experience. They dived under the truck for protection. The engine of the truck began to sputter and run roughly as the object approached, and the headlights dimmed, but the engine didn\'t stall and the lights didn\'t go out completely.  As it reached them, the object seemed to slow, as if taking a look at the truck. Robinson thought the object or the light from it was visible for about two minutes. As it disappeared in the west, the lights of the truck brightened and the engine smoothed out, running normally. When Robinson returned home, his wife, Betty, said that he looked as if he had seen a ghost. His face was white, and he was so excited that it was hard for her to understand what he was trying to say.  She was able to tell him about her sighting. While sitting in the house, she had heard the roar of the object as it passed over, and had seen the light. The interior of the house had been brightly illuminated with a strobing effect. She wasn\'t alone in her sighting. Joseph Benini, the police chief, said that he was at a city council meeting when they all heard the roar. Bernini said that it sounded like an artillery shell going over He saw the bright light but didn\'t see any object. He had been inside the whole time.  As the object flew over Eureka, the street lights all went out. Bernini, interviewed by reporters, said that the street lights were on photoelectric cells and the bright light caused them to go out. According to him, no one else reported any power failures. Bernini\'s wife and son saw the light, but the son, David, also saw an object. Those who did see the object confirmed the direction. It was moving from southeast to northwest. Many of those who saw it said that it was within a thousand feet of the ground. There was an object visible behind the glow, and Shields, the pilot, had said that he not only saw the glow but also the object. The important fact was that Shields was looking down when he saw it.  Kadesch, when asked, said that he believed the object was a bolide and that it had exploded sixty to seventy miles in the air. The flash was so bright that residents of Gridley, Kansas, reported seeing it. Others, such as witnesses in Reno, also claimed to have seen the flash.Kadesch took it further, explaining that the people on the ground, looking up into the night sky, had no points of reference. It was difficult for them to judge size and distance, especially if they didn\'t know exactly what they were seeing.  Kadesch, who hadn\'t seen the object himself, but whose family had, still said it was a bolide. There was no doubt in his mind. when asked about the flight crews who reported the object below their aircraft, he said, ""That information is too fragmentary. It could be the curvature of the earth that made them believe that."" But in Reno there was an added complication. A witness there, Homer Raycraft, said that he saw a ""big fireball traveling due east."" He claimed that the object disappeared behind a mountain range and then there was a big flash. Others in Reno, such as Dwight Dyer, Reno bureau chief of the Associated Press, the controllers in the Reno airport control tower, along with the controllers in Elko and Las Vegas, also reported they saw the flash. It was described as a brilliant white with a long tail, changing to green, orange, and red.Another aircrew also saw the object. According to officers at Stead Air Force Base, a Bonanza Air Lines pilot said that the light passed beneath his aircraft, which was flying at eleven thousand feet.  That made two flight crews in two different aircraft who had reported the object below their planes. Coupled with the testimony of three witnesses in Utah who said the object was about five hundred feet above them, it tended to rule out the bolide theory because the meteor would have been too low for too long.  Another problem developed when all the material from the Reno newspaper was reviewed. The newspaper contained a drawing showing the path of the object as it passed over Nevada. The problem is that the drawing showed it traveling from the north, over a corner of Nevada, to crash to the ground near Eureka, Utah. It was traveling, according to the Nevada witnesses, in a direction opposite that claimed by the Utah witnesses. Had the object been a fireball, everyone would have given it the same direction of flight. Those in Nevada would have been looking to the east when they saw it, but they would have talked about it moving in the same general direction as those who had sighted the UFO in Utah.  The Los Angeles Times reported that the object was seen over Reno and traveling to the east. It also reported that the light was seen in Las Vegas.  The question becomes, how is that possible for a meteorite?  An air force spokesman at Nellis Air Force Base said that meteors are not normally tracked by radar. The ionized trail left by them is sometimes detected, but that is a streak on the scope and not a single moving point as described by the military operators in Las Vegas. How do we know that the object seen in Las Vegas is the same one that was reported in Utah and over Reno? It looked as if we had two sightings: one over Las Vegas on April 18, and one over Utah on April 19. With two sightings, there isn\'t all that much unusual to explain. A meteor fell near Eureka, Utah, and something else tracked on radar near Las Vegas.  But I knew that wasn\'t quite right. I had talked to a man, who wishes to remain anonymous, who was in Eureka, Utah, on the night the ""meteor"" fell. He was driving through town and watched the glowing orange ball. He saw it close to the ground, but then saw it take off again. It knocked out the lights all over Eureka, before climbing out again. Something that a meteor could not do.  He was close enough to the object to see an oval shape and to hear a quiet whirring noise. It took off toward the west, heading into Nevada. He watched it until it faded from sight over Nevada. The point here is that there was a witness who had seen the object come down near Eureka as had others. But unlike them, he had seen it lift off again, streaking toward the west. It suggested that the object hadn\'t ended its flight in Utah. Linked to the reports in Nevada, it suggested that a single object was responsible for all the sightings.  The air force, which had received all the findings, initially did the same thing, linking the reports. Officers at Stead Air Force Base, Nellis Air Force Base, and NORAD all drew that conclusion. The reports from Utah and Reno claim the sighting was made about fifteen minutes after the hour (Utah, on Mountain Standard Time, reported the incident at 8:15. Reno, on Pacific Standard Time, reported it at 7:15). The Nellis radar case, according to the official air force file, listed the time of the sighting as sixteen minutes after the events in Utah, but the official spokesman at Nellis said the Air Defense Command was alerted by the fire trail that was seen at approximately 7:20 P.M., Pacific Standard Time, or within minutes of the reports from Utah. More importantly, fighters were scrambled from Luke Air Force Base in Phoenix after the radar sightings.  Other documents included in the Project Blue Book files suggested that fighters had also been scrambled from Nellis.  Another point must be made. The reports, as filed in Project Blue Book, were deceptively dated. The Utah case had the time logged in ""Zulu,"" or Greenwich Mean Time, which means it was advanced at that time of the year by six hours. Add six hours to the 8:15 time, and you advance it to early morning the next day. A quick glance at the file shows the Utah case dated April 19, and the Las Vegas case logged in local time as April 18. On paper it looks as if they take place on separate days when, in reality, they happened within minutes of each other on the same day.There are other interesting notes in the official files. A spokesman for the 28th Air Division at Stead Air Force Base admitted the power in Eureka was knocked out and that fighters had been scrambled from Nellis as a result of the radar sightings there. Then, on September 21, 1962, Major C. R. Hart of the air force public information office, responding to a letter sent by a New York resident, claimed:    The official records of the Air Force list the 18 April 1962 Nevada sighting to which you refer as ""unidentified, insufficient data."" There is an additional note to the effect that ""the reported track is characteristic of that registered by a U-2 or a high balloon but there is insufficient data reported to fully support such an evaluation."" The phenomena reported was not intercepted or fired upon. Not intercepted? With reports in the files that clearly showed fighters were scrambled from Nellis and other reports of jets taking off from Luke? What about the explanation that the reported track was characteristic of a balloon or a U-2? Which was it? A balloon track would be made at the whim of the wind, ""flying"" in the direction the wind was blowing, changing direction as it passed from one level to another. A U-2, under intelligent control of a pilot, wouldn\'t be flying an erratic pattern. Surely the radar operator would have been able to tell if he was tracking a balloon or a jet.  The response to the man\'s letter was a lie, pure and simple. The evidence in the file showed that. But more important is the fact that the air force was claiming that the object might have been a U-2 or a high-altitude balloon. The reason they couldn\'t pin it down was that there were no records of such a flight or balloon launch. They were grasping at straws. Might have been a balloon. Could have been a high-flying U-2 spy plane. But it wasn\'t either.  Remember, there was a follow-up that claimed the object was so bright that it affected the photoelectric cells on the Eureka street lights. That is a good, logical explanation for the reported power outage, but doesn\'t account for all the facts. The lights in Nephi, according to Raymond Jackson, were knocked out.  Photoelectric cells fooled by the brightness of the object do not account for that.  And near Eureka, Bob Robinson reported that his truck engine and headlights were affected by the overflight of the object."" It seems that the UFO was displaying the same kind of electromagnetic effect that had been reported in dozens of other UFO cases.So what do we have here?  We have the story of an object that was seen to begin its journey over Oneida, New York. It was seen by thousands. In Utah it neared the ground, landed, and took off not on April 19 as claimed by the air force, but on April 18. It was close enough to the ground that people in the center of Utah got a good look at it. It maneuvered while close to the ground, slowing down and speeding up. The witnesses in several Utah communities centered around the Eureka and Nephi areas thought that it landed. One witness reported it on the ground and then taking off. It continued its journey until it was close to Reno, then turned to the southeast, flew over Las Vegas, where it was tracked on radar, and then blew up.  Documentation for the sighting is available through a variety of newspapers, including the Las Vegas Sun, Los Angeles Tribune, Desert News and Telegram, Salt Lake Tribune, Eureka Reporter and Nephi News-Leader. Further documentation came from the Project Blue Book files and Frank Edwards. It is a case that demonstrates the air force\'s policy of explaining UFO sightings, even if they have to change dates to make the explanations wok. It shows that the air force would lie to the public about the UFO situation. And it shows that air force investigators, when handed a solution, wouldn\'t ask the basic questions. They accepted the solution quickly.  That means that the officer handing out the U-2 or balloon explanations would know that all flights above fourteen thousand feet were tracked carefully. And he would know that U-2s aren\'t like a privately owned Piper Cub or Cessna that operates below the critical altitude of fourteen thousand feet Flights are planned and logged, and those records still exist if there had been a U-2 flight in that area, the air force could have proved it.  And the same thing can be said for the high-altitude balloons. By 1962 they were tracked religiously. With so many commercial aircraft using the skies, the military couldn\'t af ford to have a passenger plane fly into a research balloon. They knew where the balloons were and what tracks they took. The radar sighting might suggest a high-altitude balloon or U-2, but that isn\'t the solution.  Finally, the air force files connect the two events, though they eventually separated the reports in Las Vegas from those in Utah. On a page in the file that appears prior to the intelligence report prepared by Douglas Crouch, an unknown officer wrote:  On April 18, 1962, the Air Force Defense Command was puzzled by an aerial object that exploded and seemed to be a meteor, but had the unique distinction of being tracked by radar 70 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada in a blinding flash. An Air Force Defense Command alert reported the object was tracked and traced over New York, Kansas, Utah, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Wyoming, Arizona and California, so that its light covered almost as much area as that created by the big hydrogen space bomb test held later in the Pacific hundreds of miles high. That notation is not in the Las Vegas file, but in the Utah file. And it suggests that radars in other parts of the country from New York to California tracked the object. The flight time, according to the Las Vegas sighting report, was thirty- two minutes, much too long for a meteor. A meteor would cross the United States much faster. And it means that the object, whatever it was, was not a meteor.  With the cases separated, the air force was able to deal with them piece-meal. The Utah case could become a bolide. Robert Kadesch, a scientist not involved with the UFO project at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base or the Foreign Technology Division, made a plausible witness. His statement, reported throughout the country, sounded good, when the testimony of the other witnesses is overlooked.  It is easy to accept the Air Force explanations of the case if they are taken as separate events. It is easy to believe that the Utah sightings were the result of a meteor, although the original investigators, Crouch and Brion, said that they had no explanation for the sightings.  This also reveals that the air force was not interested in investigation or solving riddles. They were interested in clearing cases, slapping a label on them and letting it go at that. We know it because they interviewed the Utah witnesses such as Bob Robinson and Floyd Evans. They interviewed a dozen witnesses, some of whom described the object and who said it was close to the ground. They knew that power had been knocked out in Nephi but reported only that the light was so bright it affected the photoelectric cells in Eureka. They ignored the information that didn\'t fit with the bolide theory.  Something extremely extraordinary happened on the night of April 18, 1962. The air force offered a series of explanations ignoring the facts. But the witnesses who were there know the truth. They saw something from outer space, and it was not a meteor. It was a craft from another world.  author: Kevin Randle Source: A History of UFO Crashes, page 79-94, (1995) Kevin Randle  http://www.nicap.dabsol.co.uk/vegas1.htm']"
1996, ,"[""1996-Alleged UFO Crash in Boyle Co., IrelandAccording to the Mirror, 'UFO expert' and 'clairvoyant' Rory Thornton, who runs a 'clinic' in Newcastle Co. Galway, maintains that the Irish Government have been covering up the crash of an extra-terrestrial craft near Boyle, Co. Roscommon, in May 1996. Mr. Thornton has gone to such lengths as even comparing the crash to the alleged cover up of the controversial 'Roswell Incident' of 50 years ago, and he seems to be of the opinion that the 'Roswell Coverup' is established fact, rather than a swamp of glutinous information. Apparently, this spacecraft 'got into trouble' before hitting some trees and 'bouncing into a lake'. Without a smidgen of an explanation as to how these spacemen, or, as he calls them, the 'Sunasians' got their machine working again, Mr. Thornton says he's in regular contact with them using telepathy. The article veers off into an off-the-rack 'The aliens are worried that we're running our planet into the ground' scenario, which is reminiscent of the 'Create Your Own Conspiracy Theory' website. The icing on the fruitcake comes in the form of this wonderful quote: 'They are are like humans. In fact we are the aliens to them'. Mr. Thornton's allegations concerning Irish Governmental conspiracies are rather interesting, especially when one considers the spate of dirty laundry which has recently been aired in Dáil Eireann and Dublin Castle. According to Mr. Thornton, an anonymous Boyle Garda (Irish policeman) maintains that the local Gardai were told to 'keep their noses out of it' by Government officials who were on the scene of the supposed crash. Over coffee and whiskey last night, author and lighthouse visitor Peter Costello wryly pointed out to me that it may have been Mr. Ray Burke trying to sell passports to the 'aliens'. For those of you who are unaware, Mr. Burke was Irish Minister for Foreign affairs until Tuesday 7th October, when he resigned amid allegations of his having sold passports to wealthy Saudi Arabian bankers in return for $20 million pounds of industrial investment. Incidentally, Mr. Burke was not in government when the Boyle incident took place. People in Boyle seem to be adamant, if one can believe the Sunday Mirror, 'that something big happened there that night'. Several US military Jeeps were also allegedly seen in the area, but as some of you may remember, this isn't the first time that Blather has discussed the diplomatic intricacies of letting foreign military personnel wander about Ireland, officially or otherwise. In fact, this isn't the first time I'd heard about the 'Boyle Incident' either, the tale came to my notice via the grapevine almost a year ago, and supposedly propagated by an anonymous Boyle Garda (presumably the one mentioned above). It told of 'something crashing', pieces of debris everywhere, the general area being overrun by the security forces and the arrival of a few large cars, supposedly containing unnamed politicians and US embassy representatives. I heard no more about it, but the story did get round, and with surprisingly minimal embellishment, until three weeks ago, when the Mirror got hold of it. So, if anything happened, what could have happened? Let us, for a start, discount the extra-terrestrial hypothesis, and consider the implications of something even as trivial as a drop tank from a US military aircraft falling on Irish soil. This might drag Ireland's so-called neutrality into question, hence the presence of politicians, US embassy officials etc. at the 'crash scene'. It wouldn't be the first time that something of this nature has taken place, even without the inclusion of any cross-border trespasses in the cauldron of conspiracy. Many years ago, a large object buried itself in the side of one the Wicklow mountains, in eastern Ireland. It was mentioned on early morning radio, and it was hypothesised that some sort of of unmanned drone had wandered out of a British military testing area in the Irish Sea. Some 'British officials' allegedly appeared and took it away with them, and not another word was heard. Or so the story goes.

', 'The Yukon Territory Encounters, 1996 (Klondike Highway)\\22+ Witnesses Observe a UFO Larger than a Football StadiumYukon Territory, CanadaInvestigated by Martin Jasek, M.Sc., P. Eng.The following is as brief a summary that could be made from a complex 22-witness event and still retain a good portion of the impact and scope of what had occurred. More detailed descriptions and vivid quotes from the witnesses can be found in the individual witness testimonies.Event SummaryWitnesses FOX2 and FOX3 were driving together from Whitehorse to Carmacks in two separate vehicles. As they were travelling northbound on the Klondike Highway adjacent to Fox Lake, they spotted a huge UFO out over the frozen lake.Fox Lake is on the west side of the highway. Both of them slammed on the brakes stopping about 570 metres (1870 ft) apart from each other. FOX2 got out of his vehicle for a better observation.The UFO proceeded to slowly drift towards FOX2 and after a few minutes he found himself almost directly underneath the object! FOX3 continued to observe his cousin FOX2; both men were in complete awe!. The UFO continued to move slowly across the highway and out over the hill to the east and eventually disappeared behind it. Immediately after the sigthing, FOX3 noted that the time was 8:30 pm. Both FOX2 and FOX3 could discern that the lights were attached to a smooth and solid object.At the very same time that FOX2 and FOX3 were observing the UFO move across the lake, FOX4 and FOX5 were approaching the southern tip of Fox Lake also heading northbound.What they observed was a huge row, or rows, of lights slowly moving across the lake. There were other lights on and around the UFO as well. Their first thought was that it was a large truck in the distance, but it couldn’t be, it was out over the lake. Their next thought was that a Boeing 747 was crash landing. But that couldn’t be either, it was moving much too slowly to be an aircraft.It took them about 2 seconds to process these thoughts when they realized that it must be a UFO! They got very concerned. They had a two-year-old son in the back seat and they were travelling towards this thing! After some debate they decided to continue their journey.After all, they could no longer see the UFO as they approached a hill that obscured their view plus there was some traffic ahead of them. FOX5 looked at the car clock, it was 8:23 pm. None of the witnesses heard any sound coming from the object.A few minutes later, when FOX4 and FOX5 were passing the Fox Lake campground, they passed by two vehicles that were pulled over with two men outside looking up at the sky. They turned around and pulled over to talk to them.It was FOX2 and FOX3 carrying on a lively discussion, ""What the ‘heck’ was that?"" After a few minutes FOX4 and FOX5 left and eventually stopped at Braeburn Lodge about 34 km (21 miles) further up the highway. FOX4 walked into the lodge and said to Steve Watson, the lodge owner ""Steve, I really need a coffee!"" Steve replied ""Oh, you must have seen what FOX1 saw?"" In fact FOX4 recalled seeing FOX1 leaving Braeburn Lodge just as they got there.About half an hour before the sighting described above (about 8:00 pm) FOX1 was driving along Fox Lake and had noticed a light in the distance which should not have been there. He did not think too much of it but as he got closer to the light, he could tell that it was illuminating a long smooth curved surface.He then passed some traffic and after his eyes readjusted to the darkness, the curved surface and the light were gone. However, his eye caught a group of rectangular lights moving over and behind a hill to the east.At this point he got an ""exhilarating feeling"" and sped up in order to reach a less obscured location in the valley so that he would have a chance to see the UFO again. He pulled over and got out of his vehicle but didn’t see anything more unusual. He continued his journey and pulled into Braeburn Lodge where he gave Steve a description of what he saw and also made drawings for him. FOX2 and FOX3 eventually pulled into Braeburn Lodge and gave their description to Steve as well.There was also a 6th witness to the Fox Lake sighting but it is unclear what time she had driven through the area. FOX6 was driving in the vicinity of Fox Lake when she noticed a glow on her dashboard that could not be accounted for by the interior illumination of her vehicle.She leaned forward to look up through her windshield and observed a large arrangement of multi colored lights. The interior lights in her car started to go dim and the music from her tape deck slowed down.At around the same time, between 8:30 and 9:00 pm, the Village of Pelly Crossing (about a 2 hours drive to the north of Fox Lake) was experiencing its own truly incredible UFO sighting. PEL1 was tending his trapline northeast of Pelly when he observed in the distance to the southwest a long row of lights slowly moving over the hills. At first he thought it was a large aircraft coming down. But it was moving much too slowly.""It’s a UFO!""As he was walking his flashlight happened to point in the direction of the UFO. As if reacting to his flashlight, the UFO started speeding rapidly toward him.He instinctively cupped the end of his flashlight. As soon as he completed this gesture, the UFO stopped in its track. In a matter of less than a second, it was hovering an estimated 300 yards (275 metres) in front of him! PEL1 had to turn his head from one side to the other to take it all in.Again there was no sound at all coming from the object. A beam of light emanating from the bottom of the UFO swooped the ground once directly underneath the object. Was it a search beam? Looking for him? The UFO then drifted slowly to the right. There were other beams emanating from the craft as well; a greenish phosphorescent color beam shone horizontally out the front (right); two beams at the back (left) rotated slowly to a horizontal position.All the beams could be seen clearly as there were ice crystals in the air. PEL1 turned away from the UFO momentarily and ran across a small clearing. When he turned back to look at it, it was gone.At about the same time, PEL2 and PEL3 were travelling northbound just south of Pelly Crossing. To the north they spotted a huge row of lights slowly moving from left to right. They pulled over at a gravel pit just south of the Village to get a better look and got out of their vehicle. PEL2 noticed that the Big Dipper was just above the row of lights and compared the length of the lights to the width of the Big Dipper.They were about the same length! This observation was very important since it established a well-referenced angular size of the UFO from PEL2 and PEL3’s perspective, important for a more accurate triangulation and calculation of UFO size.The accounts of witnesses PEL1 through 3 were enough to complete a calculation of UFO size. The observations of witnesses PEL4, 5, 6 and 7 about the same time provided a second triangulation. The four women were taking an evening course at a small community college in Pelly Crossing (a satellite school of Yukon College).They were out on a break on the front deck of the one story building looking towards the west when they too observed the row of lights. The row of lights was travelling slowly almost towards them and slightly towards the north. They recall the object being huge as well; there was no sound at all. It moved slowly over the hill to the north and disappeared behind it.Then there was the UFO sighting near the Village of Carmacks seen by 9 witnesses. The UFO was observed by two groups of people. CRM1, 2, 3 and 4 were on the highway northbound in a pick-up truck just south of Carmacks; CRM5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 consisted of a husband, wife and their 3 children.They were watching television when they spotted the row of lights out of their window.The four men traveling together pulled over near the landfill at the southern edge of the Village to get a better look at the UFO. They watched the noiseless object move slowly to the northeast, curve around them to the south and head up a valley adjacent to the microwave tower south of the village where it just vanished.At one point the UFO was partially obscured behind a nearby hill and one witness recalls the UFO slowly reappearing on the other side of it. He remembers waiting a long time for the last light to reappear from behind the hill; that’s how slow and large the object was!The object took up about a 60 to 90 degree horizontal chunk of the sky. CRM1 recalls hearing about the Fox Lake UFO sighting on the radio the next day and surmised that they saw the UFO about an hour and a half earlier, about 7:00 pm.The family is not exactly sure what time it was when they saw the UFO, just that it was in the evening. They observed the row of lights just to the northwest of them moving slowly to the northeast. The lights were just over the treeline and there was no noise at all.The lights continued to move until they disappeared one by one behind what appeared to be an invisible wall. There was no mountain in that direction that could account for this. With the UFO sighting occurring just two weeks prior to Christmas, the three children thought that it was Santa Claus and his reindeer in the sky.An estimate of the UFO size by triangulation was not possible for the Carmacks UFO sighting, as the geometry of the witness locations in relation to the UFO was less than ideal. Furthermore, it was unclear whether both the family and the group of four men in the truck observed the UFO at the same time. Perhaps the UFO made more than one pass by the Village that night.There is also some evidence to suggest that this ""sighting event"" encompassed an even larger area as UFO reports were heard on CBC North radio the very next day mentioning sightings in the communities of Dawson, Mayo and Watson Lake.No witnesses from these additional communities have thus far come forward or been identified.', '1996 - Pilot Encounters Giant Pyramid-shaped UFO in BrazilFair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

Suzy bolted ahead of Reed who soon heard her barking. In a moment or two, the barking turned even more ominous sounding.Reed was sure that Suzy was in a fight with a wild animal, maybe a bear. They had spotted one earlier in the day.Grabbing a large tree branch to ward off some fierce competitor, he finally came close enough to see the cause of the struggle. To his utter shock, he was staring at a being beyond his wildest imagination.The beast was moving at lighting speed, and vibrating simultaneously. The beast grabbed Suzy and began to tear her to shreds.Reed yelled, and caught the attention of the beast, who stared at him in a fierce, menacing fashion.Somehow, Reed managed to crack the beast on the head, supposedly killing it. The creature was about 4-5 feet tall, but had more mature features than its childlike size would indicate.The creature was wearing a one piece, seamless, black garment, which rejuvenated itself when cut or torn.Reed, exhausted from the emotional, adrenaline flowing ordeal, rested for a time, contemplating what to do.After a period of two hours, Reed heard a humming sound in the forest, and followed it until he saw a black obelisk hovering above the ground.Fighting off heavy, electrostatic laden air, Reed managed to touch the obelisk. Eventually, the humming stopped. He neither saw nor heard anyone... or anything else in the vicinity of the black obelisk.The doctor was sick, and totally exhausted, but tried to regain his strength. Darkness was drawing near, so Reed wrapped up the alien in a thermo blanket for the long one and a half hour journey back to transportation.All the while, a thousand thoughts went through his head. Was what he had the discovery of the century? If so, how could he preserve and protect it? Arriving home, he placed the alien in a freezer in his garage. Soon he fell into a deep sleep.The next day, he went back to the freezer, took out the alien, and all the while manipulating the alien body parts, video taped the creature.He tried to find some friends to share the experience, but managed only one. He tried to hide his photos and videos with another friend, but the bulk of the evidence was ultimately lost, except for some that he managed to stow away.Reed claims that he and his friend were followed everywhere they went, their lives threatened, and Reed\'s house ransacked. The alien, which had miraculously come back to life, was gone. Reed says that he had to live underground for 2 years, and could not get even one UFO group to help him with his story.He also claims to have been shot during the years following the ordeal. He has spoken before several UFO groups, and written a book on his experience, ""Link--An Extraterrestrial Odyssey"" Reed Alien2\tReed Alien3Just recently, his credibility has suffered greatly. Until Reed can substantiate his claims, he is considered a charlatan and flim flam man. Usually, when you hear a story that is too good to be true, it is. I have been asked many times why my website contains mostly older sightings, and abductions. This is exactly why. See the following letter:B JShawn Atlanti, Founder and former Director of San Diego UFO Society, no longer supports or considers the ""Alien in the Forest Encounter"" or what is known as the Dr. Jonathan Reed story to be real. This story occurred in mid-October 1996 in the Cascade Mtns in Washington state. I became aware of this story on October 21st, 1996, a few weeks later on November 11th, Jonathan Reed and Robert Raith went on the Art Bell Show and told their story, they were both on two later shows in 1998, and I was on another show with them in December of 1999.There were more allegations against Jonathan Reed that occurred on the Jeff Rense radio program on May 2nd, 2002, in which Royce Myers, Kathleen Anderson, Bill Werner and Denise Charvet appear.Bill Werner and Denise Charvet knew Jonathan Reed very well before October 1996, Both stated that his real name is Jonathan Bradley Rutter and told about information about his personal history that is contrary to what Jonathan has been stated on radio shows, in public lectures, Websites, etc,This information is available at the Website www.ufowatchdog.com, and may be heard in the archive section of the Jeff Rense radio program at www.Rense.com. This latest information, along with other related problems the last 3 and half years, combined with Jonathan Reed/Rutter unwillingness to have his supposed evidence (video, slides, pictures, etc,) tested at qualified laboratories or facilities and those results made public of the analysis in a printed form. Jonathan Reed/Rutter made a statement just about 3 and half years ago on the first Art Bell show that he would be open to do this. So, I FINALLY made the decision drop my support and belief in the Jonathan Reed story, now really known as Jonathan Bradley Rutter. Shawn Atlanti may reconsider the Jonathan Reed story if all of the following conditions are met:An investigation of Jonathan Reed/Rutter in what would be termed Police/FBI styled investigation of the following areas.1. Complete background check of his employment history, education, family, close friends, etc,2. Proof of the dog known as Suzy in his story through Dog Licenses veterinarian records, etc.3. The location/address of the house that Jonathan Reed/Rutter claimed he lived in at the time of this Encounter event, and proof that he rented it from the so-called Larry Arthur, now really known as Larry Sieber, and that Larry Sieber really owned it.4. Full names of two other characters in his story, Dolly and Gary, so that they or their familles can be contacted and interviewed.5. As stated before; A complete testing of the supposed evidence from his Encounter experience.(videos, slides, pictures, negatives, etc,). The results of that testing and analysis published in a written form from the laboratory or facility, and the address/phone number of that laboratory/facility, so one is able verify the results.6. A forensic examination of the supposed gunshot wound in Jonathan Reed/Rutter shoulder by a qualified Doctor/Pathologist, and those results made public.7. There are probably other areas that need investigation, but these are good for a start.Many have been claiming the Jonathan Reed story to be a hoax/fraud, and I will now have to agree with them, unless Jonathan Reed/Rutter and his associates can prove the above conditions just listed. I probably should have came to this conclusion a long time ago, but either due own my proclivity to procrastinate, my fascination for conspiracy side of the UFO subject matter, or the gullible side of myself, I have waited this long to make this decision.Hopefully, in the near future, Jonathan Reed/Rutter will be out of the UFO business and he can try something else, and we can bring a little more sanity to the UFO subject.Regards to all interested and concerned,written by: Shawn AtlantiThe Reed website has closed down since I first assembled this article, but at the time of this writing, Summer of 2002, the Reed site carried the following message on the front page. Take it with a grain of salt, the official homepage for garcinia also has an interesting message on the front page.A note from the webmaster;Recent allegations have come to light that Jonathan created a false identity. I have received communications this week from Jonathan admitting that he, indeed, created a false identity - Dr. Jonathan Reed. He asserts that he did so in an effort to protect family and friends from the ridicule and harassment associated with cases of this nature. He further asserts that, despite claims to the contrary, the encounter did, in fact, happen.After a great deal of deliberation, I have decided to temporarily keep the OdysseyLink site intact (with some minor exceptions *) instead of taking it down while we get the whole story for the following substantive reasons;... continue at Odyssey website.', 'UFO CASEBOOK HOME PAGE""Dead Alien body recovered."" This claim has been made too many times without validating evidence. As time goes by, these fantastic stories fade away and are forgotten. In most cases, debunkers stand by their status quo anthem; ""It couldn\'t happen, therefore it didn\'t. Those of us who honestly seek the truth of the UFO mystery are always looking for that one account that may fill in the missing pieces to the age oldquestion, ""Are We Alone?"" One compelling account of an Alien body has come to us at a snails pace from the former Soviet Union, along with still frames of a video. This video tape is still under wraps in the State of Georgia, Russia.This tantalizing story comes from the Georgian UFO Association (GUFORA). They make the claim that a dead alien body was recovered by the Russian State Security Service in 1996. According to their report, an elderly woman who lived in the village of Kashtim came across the small bodied creature as she walked near her village in the vicinity of the Ural Mountains. Picking up what she thought was a baby that was ill and abandoned, she took the child home with her to nurse it back to health.After two weeks of caring for the child, the old woman became ill, and was hospitalized.Too afraid to reveal her secret, she left what she thought was a Godsend companion at home alone, and the creature died. The poor old woman confided in hospital officials, and the Kashtim Police Department intervened. They proceeded to the woman\'s house, and found the dead body on August 13, 1996. The corpse was filmed with a VHS video camera, and an investigation was completed. Radiation measurements were taken, but no abnormal readings were found. The being was measured at 8 and one-half inches in length. Soon after reports were made, the alien body was confiscated by the State Security, formerly KGB. At the present time, I am trying to get further details of this case, and will post them when and if any new information is received.source:Georgian UFO Association, (GUFORA)(B J Booth)<!--google_ad_client = ""pub-7518747415195612"";/* 728x90, created 7/4/08 */google_ad_slot = ""5690704701"";google_ad_width = 728;google_ad_height = 90;//-->BACK to Case files indexUFO CASEBOOK HOME PAGE', 'The Alien Interview / Area 51Area 51: The Alien Interview video is color video footage claimed to have been obtained by a man who identifies himself only as ""Victor,"" who purports it to be of an extraterrestrial being interrogated at a government facility.Victor maintains the footage was copied from a top-secret video originally recorded at Area 51. For fear of having his identity pinpointed, he never specifies whether he was an employee at the facility, but vaguely states that he ""had reason to be present at Area 51... more than once.""Though the Alien Interview documentary states the copy was smuggled out of Area 51, Victor once again strays from details by never specifically saying where the copying took place. He merely insists that an instance of ""data leaking"" occurred during a massive transfer of video documentation from video analog to digital disc storage in a ""(lower) security system."" Victor took advantage of the circumstances to copy the footage.On July 26, 1996, after several unsuccessful attempts to get network television companies to view and subsequently air his video, Victor contacted Rocket Pictures, an independent home video distribution company based in Los Angeles. Company president Tom Coleman, though reluctant at first, agreed to produce a documentary based on the video after his telephone conversation with Victor. Coleman sought the opinion of outside experts before going forth with making the documentary, and invited ufologist Sean David Morton to view the video.On March 13, 1997, Morton, being interviewed by Art Bell on the Coast to Coast AM radio show, made mention of the video and described it in great detail, thus marking it the first time the general public became aware of the video\'s existence. Victor himself would be interviewed by Bell just two months later. Calling from a phone and using a device to alter his voice, Victor also went into detail over the contents of the video. The alleged alien in an interrogation room. The video is approximately two minutes and 55 seconds in length. It contains the bold white characters ""DNI/27"" imposed in the bottom left corner while a clock that runs upwards from ""04:00:18:15"" to ""04:03:12:25"" during the duration of the video appears in the bottom center.A diminutive being that fits the description of that of the Greys is seated at a rectangular table. The subject, which Victor says was brought to Area 51 after its craft was shot down in 1989, is situated behind the end of the table farthest from where the video is being shot and is behind a large piece of glass which Victor describes as part of a ""bio-containment area"" meant to protect the alleged alien from microbes and viruses. Reflected in the glass is what appears to be two television monitors. The alien\'s head appears to be covered in bruises and what Morton suggests is a heart monitor can be seen on the table in front of the being.A person who Victor claims is a military officer attempting to communicate with the alien telepathically can be seen in the left foreground, while a more casually-dressed human figure can alternately be seen entering/leaving the video in the right foreground. The room where the interview is taking place is very dimly lit, so darkness obscures the two and reveals them as nothing more than two unrecognizable shadowy figures. For the same reason, only the creature\'s head is continuously visible, while brief glimpses of its torso are also shown.About halfway through the video, the alien becomes visibly distressed and appears to begin suffering from violent spasms and bouts of choking/gagging. The military officer signals for two medics, wearing scrubs and masks, to come to the aid of the convulsing alien. The medics shine a flashlight into its facial orifices, and one begins to wipe foam away from its mouth. At this point the video ends. It contains no audio, which Victor says he deliberately removed so that he could protect the anonymity of those who appear in the video.The footage has the characters DNI/27 burnt into the bottom line of the frame, along with what appears to be the time code numbers for date, minutes and seconds. The letters DNI could be an acronym for the Department of Naval Intelligence, the group responsible for the Area 51 base, a fact not many people know about. The DNI connection to Area 51 has been widely investigated. George Knapp, the TV journalist who encouraged Bob Lazar to go public with his knowledge has shown that Lazar\'s pay cheques from the time he claimed to be working at Area 51 had DNI stamped on them.

In a letter accompanying the photos, the source claims to have taken the remarkable UFO photographs on the 16th of September, 1996, in Valley, Alabama, USA.According to the phototaker,  he was repairing a fence on his property when his dog started barking loudly. Going over to where his dog was he looked up to see a low-flying capsule-shape UFO hovering and moving slowly over one of his cow pastures. The UFO captured in each of the photos resembles the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo space capsules that the United States launched in the early years of its space program. Black to dark green, the cone-shaped capsule, when blown-up, shows a black teflon-like covered bottom and a flange or rim that goes around near the top of the unknown object. In each photo the UFO is shown at a slightly different position and elevation, making it more difficult to hoax, according to researchers who have examined the photographs. The photos and a copy of the letter were aired publicly for the first time on TV-33 in Lagrange, Georgia on 26 September 1996. On the ""Heston & Steve"" show, the two hosts, Heston Yates and Steve Smoots, along with John C. Thompson and Jimmy Smith, field investigators for the International Society for Ufo Research (ISUR), speculated about whether the UFO photos are real. All of them agreed that if the photos were part of a hoax, it was a most strange and clever one. Mr. Thompson said on the program that he was ""most favorably impressed by the photos."" He also has stated since then that he has two witnesses who saw similar shaped UFOs in May and July in the LaGrange area which is only 20 miles from Valley. Another witness that he has located, says he and others saw the exact craft, incredibly, 25 years earlier in Atlanta. Mr. Smith, a long-time investigator and actual sightee of UFOs, said the photos appeared genuine. He also said that he himself, in 1971, had seen a UFO with a likeness of what the photos depict. He then went on to relate that the 1971 UFO had cut off power to his pickup while he observed it. The photos, along with a copy of the letter from the alleged phototaker, have now been sent to Jeff Sainio, a photography expert who specializes in analyzing UFO video and photos. Mr. Sainio, who often does photo analysis for the popular TV Sightings program, will determine if the photos really show a UFO. In the meantime, it is hoped that the person who took these amazing photos will step forward and allow access to the negatives that the photos were made from. All persons involved in investigating the photos are assuring the phototaker over TV and radio that if he wishes, his anonymity will be kept. Editor\'s Note: This case has good detail and a nice, clear photograph. I rarely ever add my own opinion into articles that are kept on the UFO Casebook. In this case, however, I must say that there is something just not quite right about the photograph. It has the look of a wooden water bucket turned upside down. In all fairness, I have NO proof to back up this statement, and I am keeping an open mind. Does anyone else agree with me on this?', 'The Varginha, Brazil EntityAbout 12:00 A.M. January 20, 1996: NORAD (North American Air Defense Command) contacts their Brazilian counterpart CINDACTA (I Centro INtegrado de Defesa Aerea e Controle de Trafego Aereo or Integrated Center on Air Defense and Air Traffic Control) and warns them of a UFO coming down over southern parts of the state.This information is leaked by both a Brazilian Air Force soldier, and an employee at the radar facility at Air Force Base VI Comar. Farmers Augusta and Eurico Rodrigues\' sleep is rudely interrupted by the frightened sounds of their farm animals. Attempting to find the cause, they peek out the window, seeing the animals running from one side of the field to the other.Peering into the night sky, they see a silent UFO without lights.When emergency departments receive a call that someone has seen a ""strange creature,"" usually a good laugh is had by all. At first, that is exactly what happened at a Varginha, Brazil Fire Department on the morning of January 20, 1996.This case of the unknown began early that morning with a frantic phone call stating that a ""strange creature"" had been seen in the area of Jardim Andere. Thinking that the reporter was probably someone who was drunk, or been up too long partying, this first call was in the process of being reluctantly responded to when a second call came in stating the same thing.The Fire Department personnel in Brazil are part of the Military, and must respond to all calls. What could this be, a couple of pranksters perpetuating a hoax? If so, the group was growing, as several more calls came in also reporting this unusual monster. Firemen followed the civilians\' instructions to the site.To the utter surprise of the men, they found the source of the strange reports. The entity was seemingly in a dazed condition, and was easily captured by the search party. Three protrusions stood atop of it\'s head, which glowed with red eyes.It also had long arms, short legs, and big feet. The monster sounded off with a buzz as it was taken into a net approximately 2 and one-half hours after the first call was received. Was this some type of ""one of kind"" alien who was visiting our world?Whatever it was, it was not alone. Later that very day, three girls, Lilliane Fatima, Valquira Fatima, and Andrade Xavier, were walking home after work. Taking a short-cut through a wooded area, they stumbled upon another one of these strange alien creatures. Their description of the entity was almost identical to the one nabbed earlier.Picking up their pace, they raced home. One of the girls\' mothers immediately went back to the spot of the sighting, saw foot prints, and smelled a strong scent of ammonia in the air. This was not the end of the creatures by any means.There were reports of as many as seven being captured that day. One was supposedly taken to a small regional hospital before being transferred to the larger Humanitas facility.Reports stated that the creature was escorted by military personnel. At least one of the creatures expired, and was taken for an autopsy to the University of Campinas. Reportedly, two others were taken to the University of Sao Paulo for examination.During the autopsy process, certainly many photographs and videos were taken, but so far, nothing has been released to the public save for an artist\'s rendition of the creature. Only a few weeks after the events of January 20, Marco Eli Cherese, a 23 year old military policeman who was involved in the investigation, died.Supposedly he fell ill from the effects of contact with one of the creatures. The press began a relentless search for more details of the case, and two of the girls involved began to ask for monetary compensation for their testimony. The mother of the girls, Mrs. Luiza Helena, states that she was offered a fair sum of money by four unknown men dressed in cream-colored Armani suits.This time, however, the money was to silence the testimony, not solicit it. ""They also said they would come back, but we can\'t hide the truth,"" she said.Witnesses to Being When questioned by the press, Military and Fire Department members denied any knowledge of a captured alien. This response did not come as a surprise. There were reports of an unusual amount of troop movement on the day of the monsters, indicating a cover-up.Officially speaking, all personnel at the hospitals involved denied any knowledge of the events involving the capture of any alien being. It would be only natural for those involved to be under an oath of silence, but there is one indication that the strange stories may have credibility.Pathologist Badan Palhares, who reportedly was the physician who autopsied one of the creatures, officially denied any involvement in the events, but did state that he may have more to say at a later time. Could this be a hint of an announcement to come?Several reports of UFOs were also made during the period in question, and it is surmised that the strange beings were occupants of the flying craft. There is also a possible connection to the Chupacabra monster, who has been reported many times in the South American area.The story of the Varginha entities are largely a product of Ufologist Vitorio Pacaccini, who claims to have received firsthand reports from military and hospital personnel who spoke ""off the record.""The Varginha, Brazil accounts are still in need of more ""official"" confirmation, but such is the case of many reports of this type.Hopefully, we will receive information to shed new light on this tantalizing case. Besides the drawings of the entity, there is also a UFO video taken on the same night over Varginha.', '1996 - South Africa Police Chase/Film UFOFair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

I scanned the image immediately after he gave it to me last week. I wish to remain anonymous since I don\'t want anything to do with any research or whatever on this. I know it looks like an alien or a Bigfoot and I know my grandfather was telling me the truth about him taking this picture. That\'s why I think it should be in the right hands. You are the only one I\'m sending this to, so please respect my privacy and don\'t contact me about this.Thanks in advance,Yours, (Name withheld)The only additional information is contained on the bottom of the full size image, which tells us the following:The picture was taken in the early 1930s by the sender\'s grandfather, who lived in Alaska. The entitiy was first seen when the grandfather was on his way to a lake. He chased the entity until he got close enough to take this one picture. It was some four months before the photograph was developed, being in in a remote, sparsely populated area. The sender received the picture from his grandfather only last week  His grandfather died the day after giving him the photo, and relating his story.To say the least, I was intrigued by this mysterious message. What could this image be? I downloaded it, and after looking at it a few moments, I knew it would be controversial to say the least. Little did I know that there would be more than one mystery to solve. As I began the task of selecting and cutting the area around the small creature, I thought to myself: ""Wouldn\'t it be something if this was the real thing, even though it may never be proven as such?"" What if this gentleman\'s grandfather had really filmed a creature from another world, and I was looking at the proof. My excitement was only tempered by the thought of not being able to prove it one way or the other. I would soon be faced, however, with the second mystery.After doing a couple of trial runs, I was relatively pleased with the results, considering the fact that the scanned image was from a photograph approximately 70 years old. As I looked through several of the cutouts I had made, I thought maybe I saw something... something else. The entity\'s right lower arm/hand region seemed to be obscured; but by what? So I went back to the original scan, and starting working on that particular area. What I finally saw, or thought I saw was a second, even smaller entity. Is it possible that we had a female with her child? I had done what I could, and the results were inconclusive.I thought of the many other alleged photos of aliens, and how they were met with much skeptism. In other words, I have no definite answer as to what we are looking at here. It is one of three things:1) An outright hoax, (someone in a suit) and all their time and effort was wasted.2) A single unknown being, origin unknown, and we are without a way to go any further toward discovery.3)  Number 2, with two beings.All is not lost, and just like beauty being in the eye of the beholder, so is the result of what we have here.One final question remains; Which is more important anyway, the final solution of a mystery, or that mystery remaining alive and well?(B J Booth)', '2003, Ashland, Nebraska UFO Video An extremely compelling video of an unknown flying object was recently sent to me by my good friend and UFORA member Kim Shaffer, Director of MUFON, Tennessee. The video was taken in Ashland, Nebraska on November 30, 2003. The film shows a dark, oval object which makes some maneuvers that nothing I know of can make today. The report was first filed through the NUFORC, and MUFON made an investigation. Kim has been kind enough to send me the original NUFORC and MUFON reports. I have made a short clip for your viewing. (B J) The original NUFORC report goes as follows:""About 12:45 PM my husband yelled for me to come outside, what I saw was shocking and disturbing a very large, dark colored disk shaped object was hovering in the sky just south of my home. The object seemed to move in all directions (swoop from side to side and upside down) at times it looked as if it were floating then it would very quickly and smoothly fly further south and then come back. At one point the object seemed to be on its side with the top facing us while in that position a very bright white light came from the object. After a couple minutes the object slowly moved further up and further south, my husband ran in to get the camcorder and shot approx. 15-20 seconds of footage before the object was blocked by trees and longer in view. We have shown the footage to several people all were shocked and believe what they saw was a UFO.""source:Kim Shaffer MUFON TennesseeSee original NUFORC reportSee original MUFON report View video.', 'Coyne Helicopter / UFO IncidentOctober 18, 2003 MANSFIELD -- Thirty years ago tonight, strange things were happening in the skies over north central Ohio. A close encounter in Mansfield, that has since become known as ""The Coyne Incident,"" is still raising eyebrows among believers and UFO investigators. That evening, in a soybean field on the west side of Galion, Rene Boucher and her brother Brad encountered a bright light in the sky that has lured her from Florida for another sojourn into that field. It was about 11 p.m. on Oct. 18, 1973, when an Army Reserve helicopter came perilously close to colliding with an unidentified flying object. Arrigo ""Rick"" Jezzi, 56, who now lives in Cincinnati, was flying the Huey helicopter that night. Three decades later, he is still not sure what happened. Jezzi was one of four members of an Army Reserve unit based at Hopkins Airport in Cleveland on board. The crew was en route to Cleveland from Columbus. ""Capt. Larry Coyne was the pilot,"" Jezzi said. ""I was in the left seat, actually flying the Huey at the time. We were near Mansfield flying at 2,500 to 3,000 feet."" John Healey and Robert Yanacsek were in the back of the Huey, near a cargo door with a Plexiglas window. ""One of the guys in the back reported a red light. He said it looked like an aircraft light on the right horizon,"" Jezzi said. ""I couldn\'t see it."" Jezzi was flying from the left seat. On the other side of the Huey there was a 12-foot section of fuselage between the side window and the cargo doors. He figures the red light was in his blind spot.""Then I heard \'I think its coming toward us\',"" Jezzi said. ""The next thing I knew Larry took control of the throttle. We went into a maneuver, a controlled free fall. We dropped about 2,000 feet."" Jezzi said if Coyne had not made the drastic maneuver there would have been a collision. ""It took just a couple of seconds,"" Jezzi said. ""I remember looking up through the ceiling and I saw a white light moving over top of us. I followed it to the left horizon where it disappeared."" Jezzi isn\'t sure what he saw. It was like no aircraft he\'d ever seen. He guessed it was traveling at least 500 knots, twice the speed of his Huey. ""Red navigational lights aren\'t located in the front of an aircraft,"" he said. ""That\'s what was moving toward us. I don\'t know what it was."" The incident was documented by witnesses on the ground. In UFO lore the ""Coyne Incident"" is regarded as one of the most reliable UFO sightings of all time. ""It caused a lot of hullabaloo,"" Jezzi said. ""The first thing I thought was those Commie bastards. What are they up to."" The next morning two of the other crew members, while being questioned about the incident, sketched drawings of the cigar-shaped craft they observed. ""They both came up with similar drawings,"" Jezzi said. The magnetic compass in the Huey never worked right after the incident and had to be replaced. Rene Bouchard doesn\'t know what she saw in Galion about 60 minutes earlier that same evening. ""I was in high school. My brother was in junior high,"" she said. ""There had been a lot of sightings in the days and weeks before that. Even the governor reported seeing something. We thought we\'d give it a try."" She and her brother walked out in the field behind their home and started watching the sky. ""We saw a bunch of stuff that looked like it was maybe 30,000 feet in the air,"" she said. ""But it wasn\'t anything spectacular. Then I think we both put our heads down for some reason. That\'s when we saw this brilliant white light. It was as bright as the sun. I don\'t know what it was but it scared us. We ran for two blocks until we got home."" Rene has since moved to Florida. Her brother is in California. She\'s back in Galion today and plans to go out in that same bean field to spend part of her evening. ""We really saw something that night,"" she said. ""I don\'t know what it was. But I\'ll be back there (tonight). I called my brother and asked him to fly here so he could go with me. He said no. I\'m not expecting to see anything. But I\'m going to be there."" rkent@nncogannett.com ', 'Extraordinary UFO Film Taken In UNITED KINGDOM 2003The following sighting report with video was sent exclusively to the UFO Casebook, USA. The information was shared with UFO Casebook Field Investigator Michael, who resides in the United Kingdom.The video files that are shown here were taken in Leyland, Lancashire, U. K. The film was made between 16:15 and 17:05 hours on 16 Nov 2003. The videographer Martin H. has sent very impressive film before to the UFO Casebook. Our field investigator has found him to be an honest and sincere man who is not in any way or form attemptimg to perpetuate a hoax or initiate a joke.He has never asked for any monies for his film, but has sent digital video files through the internet, and also hand given physical video tape for free use for study. The video film in its entirety is 8:13 long; is in the Windows Media format (.wmv) and is 25.15 megabytes. A sample clip of film is enclosed for your study. Below is Martin\'s description of how the taking of the video film in question transpired.I decided to have a look at the early evening sky, camcorder at ready just in case. At about 16:15, I first spotted the unknown object quite a way off in the distance (through binoculars and spotting scope). It took me around 20 minutes before I could zoom in with the camcorder to start filming.The sky was quite clear with just a few wispy clouds here and there. The distance is quite difficult to judge but I would say that the object is possibly around 10 to 15 miles away. I was on my own this time with no other witnesses and with the distance involved, I couldn\'t hear any sound emanating from the object.All in all, I managed to film around 20 or so minutes before the object disappeared behind a cloud in the distance. The object went behind the cloud at around 17:05.Martin H.UFO CasebookDownload Windows File, 590 KB(left click to play, right click and select ""save target as"" to download.)Leyland, Lancashire, U.K. Sightings, August 2002Note: The account of these sightings, the images, and video files are the property of the owner, Martin H., who resides in Leyland, Lancashire, U.K. The UFO Casebook is producing this web page with the permission of copyright holder. The files on this page cannot be reproduced in any way without the expressed written consent of the copyright holder.Leyland, Lancashire, United Kingdom.Tuesday 20th August 2002The UFO Casebook has received a compelling account of several sightings of an anomalous object which was videotaped in Leyland, Lancashire, United Kingdom.The witness has given a detailed account of these sightings, and sent along several extraordinary video clips of two unique unknown flying objects, which appear to interact with one another.There were also two corroborating witnesses to the sightings. At least for the time being, the main witness will go by the name of Martin H.My girlfriend and I were doing the evening dishes in the kitchen when she spotted what looked like a bright star in the early evening sky. She pointed this out to me and it being early evening about 20:20 hours, there were no other stars visible.I ran upstairs and grabbed my camcorder (Sony with 80X digital zoom) After several attempts I finally managed to zoom in on the object. When I looked at it, I couldn\'t believe my eyes.I zoomed in for a 4th time but this time with the camera recording and just after I had zoomed in, a black/grey saucer shaped craft moved from left to right behind the UFO which I had originally followed. This was only for a few seconds.I then returned my focus to the main object. It was an oval shape with a green metallic top and red bottom and the middle of the object seemed like an extremely bright plasma light which pulsated every now and then.The object was moving quite slowly and deliberately. I carried on filming until the object finally disappeared behind the roofline of a row of houses at the back. I would say that the object was approximately 20 miles away heading over towards the Irish sea somewhere between Blackpool and Southport. I checked the local media out for the following few days but couldn\'t find any reference to any other reports that week.There were no other aircraft (Military or otherwise) in the area and because of the distance involved I couldn\'t hear any sound emanating from the object. Leyland, Lancashire StillsI filmed the whole sequence from an upstairs bedroom window, my girlfriend could only see what appeared to be a very bright slowly moving star, as she was looking at it with the naked eye. A rough estimate regarding the height; I think it started out at approx. 3 to 4 thousand feet and looked like it descended to approx. 2 to 2 and a half thousand feet.Sunday 26th August 2002I had telephoned my brother (along with a whole host of friends) to tell them about the UFOs I had filmed, and my brother came around on the Sunday to view the video.After watching the video we went out into the back garden for some fresh air and I pointed out the area where I had filmed the objects adding that the evening sky looked exactly the same as it did then. I joked with my brother saying that I had a feeling that the object would come back again.Leyland, Blackpool, Southport MapI was just about to go back inside when I spotted it again, I couldn\'t believe my luck and I don\'t think my brother could quite believe it either. I rushed inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars for my brother so he could continue to view it from the back garden, I had the camcorder set up in no time at all and managed to film 25 minutes.Approximately 14 minutes into the filming my brother shouted up asking if I had the object in view.""Why? I asked.""""Because there is something approaching the object,"" he exclaimed excitedly.From left to right a cigar shaped craft slowly passed behind the object, which I followed until it began to fade. Then I went back to the main object. After it had disappeared behind the roofline, we immediately set up and watched the film all the way through and couldn\'t believe it when the cigar shaped object appeared.Testimony of brother, Andrew H.I went to Martin\'s house with the sole purpose of viewing the video tape of the first sighting that he had.When we had finished, we went outside as it was a warm evening. Suddenly, the object appeared again. I didn\'t want to take my eyes off it, so my brother went inside for some binoculars for me so that I could have a closer look.What I saw amazed me. It was a very bright and slow moving object which pulsed at regular intervals. We observed it for quite a while, during which time it was approached by a smaller grey object which seemed to fly past it at great speed before disappearing totally from sight.I was a little sceptical before that day, but I now know there is another world out there.Kind regards, Andy H.During the following few weeks I managed to film the object two more times and have approximately 1 to 2 hours of video.I have seen UFOs before in Holland (Where I used to live) and in Croatia (On holiday) but didn\'t have a camcorder until quite recently.Lancashire has quite a rich history regarding UFOs and just recently I have on 3 separate occasions spotted a different sort of UFO which only seems to appear for a few seconds before vanishing completely... I am going to set up my camcorder to film the area of sky involved and see what develops.(Martin H.)', ' The Manhattan Abduction (Linda Cortile Napolitano) The Linda Napolitano affair is without question one of the best documented alien abduction cases in UFO history. Most of these cases are related to authorities and investigators by a single person. It is extremely unusual to have multiple witnesses, especially those totally unknown to the experiencer,  to validate the facts of an alien abduction. Hopkins did an exceptional job of holding together the case, despite some unusual twists and turns.  Skeptics, as you would expect, dismiss the case without offering any evidence to support their theories, except the commonly used statement, ""it can\'t happen, so therefore it didn\'t.""  In a recent French magazine, La Gazette Forteenne, Issue # 2, 2003, Linda gives an interview that does add some new facts about her case. She mentions a new witness, a New York Post truck driver, who saw the abduction from the Brooklyn Bridge. No name is givenThere had also been rumors of the abduction causing a small traffic jam on the intersection between South Street and Catherine Slip. Now, there is a witness who saw the stopped traffic at approximately the same time as the abduction. Linda says:""At the New York Post complex, a well-known journalist leaves a nearby bar. Too drunk to drive, he asks one of the drivers if he can drop him home. The driver answers that the lorries cannot move because there are several limos blocking the street. He even suspected that the big boss could be paying a visit to the newspaper."" Supposedly, the lead limo was the one carrying Dan, Richard, and Cuellar. Hopefully, more information will be forthcoming in the near future.

I am reluctant to reveal the exact location out of concern for my friend's privacy as well as my own. However the general location is just North of Main street on the East side of 110 and South of the train tracks. My boy was sledding in the snow and I was taking pictures.       It was in the evening and was starting to get dark pretty quickly. My son pointed up to the sky and we noticed some lights coming in from what I believe is the south west. At that point I just pointed the camera up and took the shots. The object really gave me the impression of a balloon - except for the lights. They seemed to cycle all different patterns. The object passed almost directly overhead (picture 1) and then headed south towards the train tracks (picture 2). As the object passed I could make out more of a disk shape than a balloon shape. I just remember my son asking me over and over what it was and I didn't have a clue.

1976, ,"['Return to UFO CASEBOOK HOME PAGEOne of the most bizarre reports of unusual phenomena occurred in 1976 in the Spanish Canary Islands. Although the case features a most extraordinary description of aliens and their craft, the occurrence is extremely reliable in that it includes multiple witness reports which agreed in all aspects of the case. The phenomenon began on the night of June 22, 1976, as residents of Tenerife, La Palma, and La Gomera began reporting the sighting of unusual lights in the sky. These lights and their maneuvers were different from anything residents of the area had seen before. Newspaper headlines the next morning proclaimed that ""thousands of people"" had witnessed a ""spectacular phenomena"" which lasted ""twenty minutes."" The most sensational aspect was the sighting of the aforementioned ""sphere"" occupied by strange alien beings.Three days later, the Commanding General of the Canary Island Air Zone named an ""Investigative Adjutant"" to make sense of the events. His findings were forwarded by a Spanish Air Force General to journalist J. J. Benitez in 1976, and the details of the case quickly reached beyond the scope of the Islands to the outside world. Benitez\'s investigation would be the basis of his book, ""UFOs: Official Documents of the Spanish Government."" The case would regain momentum in 1994, when files of the investigation were released as part of the unveiling of Spanish records, a type of ""Freedom of Information"" act. The 1976 report was massive, containing over one hundred pages of testimony, evaluations, drawings, and more.The official Air Force report of the incident was headlined by depositions of fourteen witnesses. A type of standard was established with witness reliability based on social status. A doctor\'s report was considered a high priority, whereas a common laborer\'s report was given little, if any, weight. In this particular case, this unfair standard did not take away from the acceptance of the facts, since all involved were in full agreement as to what they saw. The report was very detailed, and presented chronologically.The initial report of the Canary Island UFO came from the Navy\'s armed escort ship, the ""Atrevida."" The ship was located off the coast of Fuerteventura Island. The ship\'s captain gave a detailed report of what he and his crew observed at 9:27 P.M. on June 22. The entire crew saw an extremely bright yellow-blue light moving from the shore in the direction of the ship, located three and a half miles at sea. Several of the crewmen at first thought they were seeing a conventional aircraft with its landing lights on. The lights soon faded, and a type of beam began to rotate, similar to a lighthouse effect. Afterwards, an intense halo of yellow and blue could be seen from the fantastic craft. Amazingly, the crew watched the craft for a full forty minutes. The craft seemed to be playing tricks with its lights, as they constantly changed from one form to another. Even though the light show was observed for a long period of time, no signature was evident on the ship\'s radar of any flying craft. Actual transcript-Captain of Atrevida.""At 21:27 (Z) hrs. on 22 June, we saw an intense yellowish-bluish light moving out from the shore towards our position. At first we thought it was an aircraft with its landing lights on. Then, when the light had attained a certain elevation (15 - 18 degrees), it became stationary. The original light went out and a luminous beam from it began to rotate. It remained like this for approximately two minutes. Then an intense great halo of yellowish and bluish light developed, and remained in the same position for 40 minutes, even though the original phenomenon was no longer visible.""Two minutes after the great halo, the light split into two parts, the smaller part being beneath, in the center of the luminous halo, where a blue cloud appeared and the part from which the bluish nucleus had come, vanished. The upper part began to climb in a spiral, rapid and irregular, and finally vanished. None of these movements affected the initial circular halo in any way, which remained just the same the whole time, its glow lighting up parts of the land and the ocean, from which we could deduce that the phenomenon was not very far away from us, but was close."" Only a few minutes later, this same object was seen by residents of Canary Island proper. The bulk of the sightings were by citizens of three villages; Galdar, Las Rosas, and Agaete. A cross section of professions were involved;  medical doctor, schoolteacher, farmer, taxi driver, and housewife, among others.A thorough search of records by the Investigator Adjutant determined that there were no reports of ""aerial traffic or military exercises at the time of the reports"" that could possibly account for the sightings of the unknown object . The Adjutant, for the sake of clarity, divided the investigation into two different categories. One was the larger craft observed by ship crewmen and others, and the second the smaller globe with the aliens aboard. By his own admission, and consistent with human nature, the Adjutant had no problem believing the reports of the larger craft, but had reservations accepting the orb since occupants were observed which were not consistent with human beings. The Investigator General\'s last word on the subject was: ""The fact that a very strange and peculiar aerial phenomena occurred on the night of 22 June is a true and proven fact, as incredible as its behavior and conditions may seem.""The incredible account of the sphere was submitted by Doctor Francisco Padron Leon, who lived in the city of Guia. His report is the most voluminous of the entire investigation. His background was thoroughly investigated, and he was found to be an upstanding, sane professional, whose word was considered truthful. Padron had been summoned to make a house call, and commissioned a cab to take him to the location; the town of Las Rosas. As they rode along, the doctor and cab driver were engaged in light conversation. Suddenly, the car lights pointed out a slightly luminous object in the shape of a sphere. The object was either landed, or hovering just above the ground. The object was made of a totally transparent and crystalline-like material. The doctor and driver both observed stars through the sphere.The object was bluish in color, with a radius of about 100 feet. The lower part of the orb contained a platform of aluminum-like material with three consoles. At each side of the center there were two huge figures from eight to ten feet tall. They were dressed in red, and always faced each other.The beings were humanoid in shape, with large heads covered with a type of helmet. The doctor, hardly believing his own eyes, asked for confirmation from his cab driver. ""Are you seeing what I am?"" he asked. The driver exclaimed, ""My God! What is that?"" The cab was only a short distance from the patient\'s house, and upon arriving, the doctor observed a type of bluish smoke coming from a tube rising through the center of the object. The doctor stated:""We were talking about hunting... as we entered the last part of the road, the car lights pointed at a slightly luminous sphere that was stationary and very close to the ground, although I can\'t say for sure if it was touching it. It was made of a totally transparent and crystalline-like material, since it was possible to see through it the stars in the sky; it had an electric blue color but tenuous, without dazzling; it had a radius of about 30 m. [100 ft.], and in the lower third of the sphere you could see a platform of aluminum-like color as if made of metal, and three large consoles. At each side of the center there were two huge figures of 2.50 to 3 m. [8.5 to 10 ft.] tall, but no taller than 3 m. [10 ft.], dressed entirely in red and facing each other in such a way that I always saw their profile.""""Then I observed that some kind of bluish smoke was coming out from a semi-transparent central tube in the sphere, covering the periphery of the sphere\'s interior without leaking outside at any moment. Then the sphere began to grow and grow until it became huge like a 20-story house, but the platform and the crew remained the same size; it rose slowly and majestically and it seems I heard a very tenuous whistling."" The sphere grew to an enormous size as it began to ascend into the sky. The doctor ran into the house, and told the family about what he had seen. Running outside, they observed the orb, which was now extremely high in the sky. It reached an enormous speed, accelerating toward Tenerfie. Finally it dissolved into a smaller size, and disappeared. Another witness, a lady who was a relative of the patient, was watching television when suddenly the screen went blank, and her dogs began to bark outside. Running to a window, she saw the doctor\'s cab, and the blue sphere above it. She also noted that the sphere was transparent, with two beings inside. Shocked, she closed the windows and doors, and began to pray.There were several other sightings of a similar nature throughout the year of 1976 on the Island. The final ""official"" report was ambiguous at best. The observance of the craft by all who saw it was accepted as genuine, although no ""earthly"" explanation was offered for its unique look and behavior. On the other hand, although the witnesses of the smaller orb with aliens were classified as totally reliable,  the actual presence of the beings was questioned. In other words, the witnesses were telling the truth, but what they saw was too far fetched to believe. No other explanation was forthcoming on an official level, and the Canary Island phenomenon remains today as an authentic, well documented sighting of an unidentified flying craft with occupants.sources:Benítez, J.J., OVNIS: Documentos Oficiales del Gobierno Español, Barcelona, Plaza & Janes, 1977.

Bruce, who works for a major media outlet, witnessed the objects, and the jet aircraft that persued them, and who was fortunate to capture one of these objects on film.  A little background on Bruce around the time the incident took place: Bruce was working in the news department at Channel 3, the PBS station in Portales, New Mexico. In addition to working at the PBS station he held a couple of part time jobs with two of the local radio stations as well.  At that time money was an issue due to Bruce being a college student.  Working at the different media outlets it was giving him the experience he needed for his upcoming career in Journalism. One of the overnight jobs Bruce had was in Clovis, New Mexico at KMTY FM 99.1 which was at that time one of the 100 thousand watt radio stations in the country. First Night\'s Encounter With Unknown ObjectsOn January 21, 1976 Bruce received a call from the radio station manager to see if he would mind working as the station was going to do some performance checks on the transmitter. Bruce would stay out at a remote location where some of the station\'s equipment was located. This is how Bruce ended up at the right time, and the right place, to see the events that were about to unfold in front of him in the skies above. A side note to this story is that Bruce was also a storm spotter for West Texas and Eastern New Mexico. Bruce was given a small kit which held a pair of binoculars, a note pad and a bunch of telephone numbers that he could call if a storm was spotted coming through the area. Bruce had spent alot of time at Cannon Airforce Base as he was in the civil air patrol. At that time his senior flight instructor had given him his primary flight lessons. Being on the base, and not in the military, Bruce had become friends with a lot of the base personnel.  Since he worked at one of the local radio stations he would play requests that were called in from the base security and night maintenance.  He got to know them all very well. Bruce mentioned that Cannon was located between the University of Portales and Clovis and it was common to see the F-111\'s and Aardvarks taking off from the base with full afterburners carrying out nighttime flight operations.  Bruce arrived and was sitting in his truck at the location of the transmitter.  While waiting for the phone to ring in the transmitter shack he noticed a number of pin-point lights popping up in the sky which appeared to look like light-bulbs on a string.  Two of them dropped downward until they reached a lower altitude, stopped and hovered. The lights were seen between his location and the Airforce Base at this time. While watching these strange objects Bruce grabbed the pair of binoculars he had with him. He describes the two lower lights as the classic saucer shaped craft and they had a bluish glow to them with a red radiant glow on the bottom side of the craft.  A small dome shape could easily be seen at the top of each of the two objects. In his estimation he believes the objects may have been at least 30 to 50 in diameter. The two objects were hovering parallel to one another and then started to move off at a slow rate of speed in perfect formation heading towards the airforce base. Bruce said he followed them with his binoculars for approximately 15 minutes. The objects flew past a number of buildings which were at the edge of the base and they proceeded to climb in altitude as to where they again looked like a small light in the clear night sky. Bruce said it looked as if the lights on, and in, the buildings were dimming due to the objects being in close proximity. Later after talking to base personnel, this proved to be true, the lights had dimmed, and the objects were noticed by the base personnel.  Bruce usually carried a small camera with him but on this day he had not brought it with him. Bruce called the station as he was excited to talk about what he had just witnessed. Some of the other people at the station had also been watching the events unfold that night. Through Channel 3\'s connections they heard that the objects were widely seen by many that night and by the state police. An article was written on the objects seen that January.  Second Night\'s Encounter With Unknown Objects.The next evening Bruce had gathered together a few people from the newsroom. Since Bruce was staying in a dorm on campus he knew a good number of folks on campus.  He was able to get the keys for the door to the roof so Bruce and his friends could sit up on top of the building\'s roof to watch the skies just in case something should return. Although a cool night the group stood watching.  This time Bruce did bring the camera.  At approximately 12:45 a.m. four objects dropped down from the night sky and started darting around. (This is where Bruce was finally able to capture an image of one of the crafts on black and white film.)  As the people observed the objects, the Airforce Base had scrambled the F-111\'s jet fighters out of Cannon. The jet aircraft began trying to intercept the objects. As the aircraft got close to the vicinity of the unknown objects, the objects, at an incredible rate of speed, would shoot across the sky making 90 degree turns leaving the fighter aircraft trailing way behind as they just weren\'t able to keep up with the strange craft. As the objects made  unusual turns a plasma type glow could clearly be witnessed by the group of people watching the event.The cat and mouse chase between the objects and jets went on for approximately 45 minutes. Because the witnesses were on one of the tallest buildings in Portales, New Mexico, they could clearly see the flight-line at the Base. One of the men had brought a 150 power telescope which enabled the fellows to see the objects fly at a low altitude over the flight-line. As the objects passed over the lights running down the flight line, all the lights went out. Eventually the objects shot up and were gone in a second, or so, and the F-111\'s were recalled back to the Base and landed safely. Bruce told me that a couple days after the second night sighting of the objects a couple of the Base security personnel had called and explained how the lights went out over the entire base. Of course, Bruce was asking a lot of questions at this point. The security officer from the Base told Bruce that everyone at the Cannon AFB were freaking out as they did not know what these objects were. Also the security officer said that the Cannon base was bringing in new light towers from a SAC base in North Dakota to place on the flight line. The security officer told Bruce to keep an eye on the base as it would be really lit up after the new lighting was installed.  A few days later the AFB was lit up brightly. Bruce talked to another military man from the base who said that the base had radar tape of the objects from both nights but certainly did not want Bruce to mention where the information came from. Because there were others who were there who witnessed the events that took place over the Cannon Airforce Base I will be attempting to contact these witnesses to gather their reports on the event. One other important bit of information to this case is that there is a Freedom Of Information Act document to say that jet aircraft were scrambled out of the Cannon Airforce Base that evening in 1976. Although there has been no explanation as to why, this still gives us a valuable clue that something very unusual took place that night.  Update: After Bruce went public with his story on the Jeff Rense national radio program, he and his family were threatened.  Bruce called me on July 20, 2004, after he appeared on the Jeff Rense radio program with me on Friday - July 16, 2004, when he told what he saw over the Cannon Airforce Base back in January 21, 1976. Bruce told me on the air that he had taken a black and white photograph of one of the objects that had been observed out-maneuvering the jet aircraft which were scrambled from the Cannon AFB. On July 20, 2004 at approximately 1:30 a.m. Bruce had a disturbing telephone call from an unknown person and the report on this is below.  Bruce wanted to point out to me that he does carry two cell phones with him at all times. One is for business, etc.. and the other is for personal business to keep in contact with family and close friends. He stated that no one had his private cell number as it was not listed and the only people that had this number were his wife, children, and some close friends. His children are grown up and now living on their own.  Bruce kept his cell phones on the night table.  His work phone turned off, but the private phone turned on, just in case one of his children might need to contact him in case of an emergency. As I mentioned above, it was around 1:30 a.m., Bruce and his wife had turned in for the night and were sound asleep when his cell phone started ringing.  Knowing that he had his work cell phone turned off he knew it was a call from one of his children, and of course being a parent, he worried as he grabbed for the phone. Bruce answered with a hello and a voice spoke back saying, ""Mr. Bruce (last name). Bruce said there was a very professional sounding gentleman on the other end. The man said he needed to talk to him about a matter of utmost urgency! Bruce still half asleep asked the man who he was, what was this call was all about, especially at this hour of the morning. The fellow said this is about your recent radio appearance and discussion about some photographs that you took back in New Mexico.  At this point in the conversation Bruce said to the man,""you have to be kidding me,"" thinking this had to be some kind of hoax, asked who was this. The man said there is no need for you to know who I am. He went on to say, ""it would be in your best interest to discontinue this line of discussion and do away with those photographs.  Destroy them!""  Bruce at this point is in shock about this man.  He looks on the cell phone to see what phone number is displayed and it shows ""number not available"". The man told Bruce that ""this is no joke and \'we\' feel that this would be in your best interest, and for the sake of your family, that all of this go away."" Bruce told the man that if he wasn\'t willing to reveal himself then the conversation would be terminated. The man then went on to tell Bruce what his children were involved in, meaning their daily activities, where they lived, etc.., what Bruce\'s wife was doing, such as personal activities within the family, etc... and said that he could fax Bruce his life\'s history within a few seconds. That was it, Bruce hung up and that ended the call with the stranger. After this incident took place and some weeks had gone by, a neighbor of Bruce\'s caught up with him outside one day and told him that they had been seeing alot of traffic in and out of Bruce\'s property. Cars would pull up and stay for a while and then drive off. Other times the cars would pull into the driveway, stop, and men would get out and walk around the home. Then they got back into their cars and drove off. These cars that were coming and going had government license plates on them. One other interesting fact to this story is that Bruce put together a package for me, Jeff Rense, George Filer and Peter Davenport. In this package there was a copy of the photo he had taken over the AFB. Bruce mailed out the packages to us all and not one of us have received the information. Bruce says he is going to try again and send it through a different means. I hope once I receive the material I can update this story.  So that is where this story stands right now.  I would like to extend my many thanks to Bruce for coming forward with his story.By Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.canadianufo.com HBCC UFO RESEARCH Newsletter At: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HBCC_UFO_Newsletter/ ', 'The Allagash AbductionThe Event: The Allagash Waterway is a series of lakes and canals in the breathtaking mountains of Maine. This lovely area would be the site of one of the most discussed and best documented alien abduction cases on record. A dramatized version was featured on the ""Unsolved Mysteries"" television show. The Allagash incident would involve multiple witnesses, four to be exact, twin brothers Jack and Jim Weiner, along with their friends Chuck Rak and Charlie Foltz. The four men had met while studying at the Massachusetts College of Art, and they were all beginning their respective careers. The four artists would turn into sportsmen for what they thought would be an enjoyable, relaxing trip. Their trip to Allagash would be memorable, but not for the reasons they had hoped for.  It would be in August 1976, that the four men began their vacation, and part way through their canoeing, they reached Eagle Lake, padding to it\'s mouth to do some fishing. Not having any luck, and running low on food, they decided to try some night fishing. Before leaving the bank, they built an extremely large campfire to be a landmark light from the water. After a time on the lake, the four suddenly saw a light... a light that seemed much brighter than a star. The glowing orb was hovering over the trees a couple of hundred yards away. The object changed colors as it moved back and forth; red, then green, then a whitish yellow. The massive object was estimated to be about 80 feet in diameter. The object slowly moved across the tops of the trees along the bank, and as it came closer to the four fishermen, Charlie Foltz signaled an SOS with his flashlight. Immediately, the object silently moved toward the canoe.  A guarded curiosity now turned into a frantic dash for the bank. As they paddled as fast as they could, a hollow light came from the object, engulfing the men and their canoe. The next thing the men knew, they were standing on the bank again. Charlie pointed his flashlight toward the object again, but this time it rose up and out of their view, as it showed it\'s beam once more before disappearing into the Allagash sky. Wondering what had transpired, the men were shocked to see their once glowing fire to be nothing but smoldering ashes. This should have taken several hours, and the four friends wondered, ""What happened to the last couple of hours?""Very little was said as the four men packed up their gear and went back to the everyday grinds of their respective careers. In time the night of the UFO would begin to have a profound effect on their lives.Jack Weiner was the first to start having nightmares. In these dreams, he saw beings with long necks, and large heads. He saw the beings examining his arm, while Jim, Chuck, and Charlie sat on a nearby bench, not able to intervene. The beings had large metallic glowing eyes with no lids, and their hands were insect-like, with four fingers. The other three men were experiencing very similar dreams, with short, mental clips of that awful night on the lake. In 1988, out of curiosity, Jim Weiner attended a UFO conference hosted by Raymond Fowler. Weiner met Fowler afterwards, and related his strange encounter. The investigator was excited about Jim\'s story, especially the fact that it was a multiple witness occurrence. Fowler suggested to Jim that he and the others undergo regressive hypnosis. After the sessions, it was revealed that all four of the men had been abducted, and subjected to humiliating physical examinations, including the taking of skin and fluid samples. The men\'s description of the aliens was consistent, and being artists, they were able to make detailed sketches of the entities, the craft, and the examining instruments. Chuck Rak added that the aliens\' test area was similar to a vet\'s office, with a silvery table. He also related a strange fact: he had much difficulty in focusing on the aliens. When he tried, he could not put an exact image to them. He compared it to trying to tune in a fuzzy radio station.After the psychiatric examinations, all four of the men were deemed to be mentally stable, and they all passed lie-detector tests. All of the information gleaned from the detailed hypnotic sessions, and investigative reports provide strong evidence that something ""not of this world"" was encountered by these four men on the Allagash Waterway in 1976. This case is still considered unexplainable by conventional scientific means. (Allagash The Event written by B J Booth)Aftermath:When you chat with Anthony Constantino, there\'s always one inevitablequestion: ""Do you believe them?"" ""Them"" is a group of four friends whowent camping on the Allagash Waterway in northern Maine in the summerof 1976. Maybe you saw them recently on the Joan Rivers Show, wherethey detailed an ordeal in which they claimed they had a closeencounter with a UFO. They are receiving national attention with therelease this summer of ""The Allagash Abductions"" written by RaymondFowler of Wenham who is a director of investigations for the MutualUFO Network.Those who are familiar with this case know that the full story, withall its mysterious and harrowing details, wasn\'t revealed untilAnthony Constantino of Beverly placed the four men under hypnosis, andrevealed events that had been pushed into their unconscious.""It was the most intense experience I\'ve had as a hypnotist,"" saysConstantino.The conscious part of the story begins on Thursday, August 26, 1976,when the four men - Chuck Rak, Charlie Foltz, and identical twins Jimand Jack Weiner, set up camp on Eagle Lake in Maine, and decided to gofishing in the evening.  They built a huge bonfire to act as a beaconfor their return to camp.Soon after they were out in their canoe, they saw ""a large brightsphere of colored light hovering motionless and soundless about 200 to300 feet above the southeastern rim of the cove,"" according to Rak.Foltz blinked a flashlight at the object. Maybe that was a bad idea.The UFO began to approach the canoe, while a cone-shaped beam of lightfrom the object struck the water and began following the canoe. Moreinspired than any Olympic athletes, the four campers began paddlingfor shore.But the beam engulfed them, and the next thing they remembered, theywere in the canoe, near the shore of the lake, watching the UFO ascendand disappear.  The bonfire was now nothing more than embers. Builtwith heavy logs, the fire should have lasted hours. It was the firstindication that more time had elapsed than they could remember, butthey had no conscious memory of what had happened.It was years later before the four men explored that missing periodof time. When Jim Weiner suffered tempero-limbic epilepsy, hisdoctors asked him to report any unusual experiences that might besymptomatic. Weiner described his UFO experience, and variousphenomena that had happened to him and his camping buddies since then.His doctors suggested he contact a UFO researcher.Enter Anthony Constantino. A professional hypnotist from Beverly, whoalso works as an English teacher at Masconomet High School,Constantino had hypnotized Ray Fowler in 1988, helping him to rememberthe details of Fowler\'s own alleged abduction in Danvers.Fowler was leading the investigation of the Allagash abductions forthe Mutual UFO Network, and he wanted Constantino to hypnotize each ofthe four men separately.All four men were willing to participate.""It\'s natural,"" says Constantino. ""They wanted to know if somethinghad happened to them -- especially if it were something traumatic.They wanted to know for sure.""In 1989, in the dark den of Constantino\'s Beverly home, each of thefour men separately recounted a tale of being beamed aboard the UFOthat night on Eagle Lake. Under hypnosis, they described the diffuselylit, sterile interior of the spacecraft, the spindly fingered big-eyedbald-headed aliens that Whitley Strieber popularized with hisnon-fiction book ""Communion,"" and strange medical experimentsconducted on each man.Constantino says Fowler was cool and professional as he observed the12 hours of hypnosis sessions, but Constantino admits that at times hehad difficulty repressing his own astonishment.""I\'m the one who kept making faces at Ray, like, I can\'t believethis. I can\'t believe what was done to these guys."" Which brings us back to The Question. Constantino conductedthree-hour hypnosis sessions with each of the four men. He heard theirvoices fill with fear as they explained how medical instruments wereinserted into their bodies, and how communication from the aliens wastelepathic. Constantino says he went into the session ""with no preconceivednotions,"" nothing more than a healthy curiosity about an unexplainedphenomenon.But was he convinced?""Do you believe them?"" Constantino is asked.He pauses and rubs his chin, as if weighing the gravity of the question. He looks up and nods solemnly.""I do,"" he says. After working with those guys, I was scared. I stillam. I think it\'s true. I think they were being tagged -- the way wetag and study sharks and bears and then release them. The men werehighly indignant that they were taken (aboard) and these things weredone to them without their permission.(Allagash Aftermath written by Alexander Stevens)This article was taken from the Arts & Leisure section of the North Shore Sundaynewspaper published in Salem, MA  dated September 12, 1993:sources:Ray Fowler, ""The Allagash Abductions.""Return to  Alien Abductions Index  Allagash Abduction, Part 2.', 'UFO Sighting - Colusa County, California, 1976Fair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

On the 19th, the Air Force of Iran began receiving calls from local citizens reporting an unusual, unidentifiable object in the skies.The Air Force duty officer called the Assistant Deputy Commnder of Operations informing him of the situation, and asking for guidance in how to handle the situation. He knew there were no planes flying at the time that could account for the strange reports.At first Yousefit thought the edgy citizens were seeing just stars or the planet Venus, but after even more inquiries, he decided to look for himself.As he checked out the unknown object, he knew immediately that it was no star. It was much larger and brighter. He made the decision to scramble an F-4 jet from Shahrokhi Air Force Base to get a closer look at the unusual object. The plane left the runway at approximately 1:30 AM to intercept the UFO.The plane sped toward the large, bright unknown which lay some 70 miles north of them. About half-way there, the plane began to experience communication problems.Instrumentation was also faulty, so the pilot dropped off course, heading back to Shahrokhi. As the F-4 changed course, instrumentation and communication was suddenly restored.Had the UFO compromised the plane's functions as it approached, and then allowed them again as the plane dropped from its course?Another F-4 left the air base, attempting to identify the UFO. As the second jet approached the UFO, they made radar contact. Crew members stated that the size of the radar return was similar to that of a 707 jet. The actual size of the object was impossible to determine visually because of the brilliance of the glowing object.The jet drew nearer to the UFO.For a time, the F-4 bridged the distance between itself and the UFO, but even flying above Mach 1, the UFO suddenly shot away from the F-4. This incredible burst of speed was confirmed by the plane's radar and also visually.The pilot of the F-4 was not able to gain any ground on the UFO, but managed to pace it as they sped through the skies.The crew of the plane would later say that the UFO had strobing lights arranged rectangularly. The lights alternated from red, blue, green, and orange in color. The plane's crew was astonished to see another, smaller object emerge from the large UFO. The plane and UFO were now flying south of Tehran.The smaller object made a bee-line to the F-4 moving at incredible speeds.Fearing for their very lives, the pilot aimed an AIM-9 missie at the approaching object, but just as he did, the weapons control panel went off line, and he lost all communication. The only course of action left was to dive to try to avoid a collision with the approaching UFO or weapon.The approaching object followed the plane into its dive briefly, but then tailed off, and returned to the larger UFO. All functions were again on line as the UFO left the jet behind.There was never an explanation for what two F-4 jets chased over the skies of Tehran.The crew members stated that the UFO moved at incredible speeds and had the ability to disable the plane's instrumentation. This is one of the best documented UFO / Plane chases on record.(written by B J Booth)""]"

Carlos Cauich Carrillo shot a video of an unknown object that appeared to accompany the airliner in which he was a passenger for several minutes. The flight was covering the Tapachula-Mexico route on September 21, 2005.  When interviewed, the witness states that he felt very nervous and that he felt as though ""something or someone"" had placed him there at the exact moment the sighting was to occur, since he was initially only filming images of the landscape as seen from the air. The video was made with a Cyber Shot DSC-P32, 3.2 megapixels, and has an approximate duration of 10 seconds. Upon reviewing the material, I noticed that this unidentified flying object was performing irregular movements at high speed, vanishing completely out of frame at certain moments. This confirms Ing. Cauich\'s notion that the alleged UFO was speeding away from the airliner and then returning. This event took place at 14:15 hours as the Mexicana de Aviacion airliner flew over the state of Oaxaca\'s Salina Cruz region. Ing. Cauich has has sightings prior to this date. His steadfastness in watching the skies and his ability to obtain UFO evidence is noteworthy. As an additional piece of information, I interviewed aviation technician Alfonso Salazar Mendoza, a UFO researcher and writer, who kindly informed me that commercial airliners flying at cruising altitude achieve speeds of 800 km per hour and an altitude of 12,000 meters. This information provides an approximate estimate. Sincerely,Profra.

I havenever reported anything like this before. At 23:30 on 5/27/05 while taking my nightly walk, I obsereved a triangluarcraft (craft) traversing the sky from north to south at about 20K feet. Thesky is very clear this night with several miles of clear visibility. The craft\'s speed was about 500 knots. The craft was perfectly silent andmoving rapidly. Several miles behind the craft was what appeared to be afighter jet moving very rapidly, 600 to 700 knots. As the jet was chasingthe craft they both where flying toward my position. I could begin to hearthe engines of the jet at that time. It appeared as thought the triangular craft was toying with the jet in thatas the jet got closer to the craft, the craft would speed up somewhat andleave the jet behind. As the craft and jet got nearly directly over mylocation, the triangular craft made a sharp right hand turn the the west.The jet was unable to make the turn at the same angle as the craft. Thejet\'s turn was much more pronounced and made a much wider loop. Due to that, the jet lost quite a bit of ground on the craft during theturn, yet again as both craft began traverseing in a straight line towardthe west-nortwest the craft again appeared to toy with the pursuing jet inthe same manner aforementioned. After a few seconds it appeared that the craft accelerated dramaticaly andleft the jet behind. I observed the jet make one tight loop several milesfrom my position and then turn off to the north-northeast and flew out of myline of sight. One thing that was odd about the triangular craft was the three lightsmaking up the trianglar pattern were not equal in distance. Referencing thewingspan of the jet, two of the lights on the craft were about 50 to 75 feetapart and the third light was approximately 100 to 150 feet from the othertwo lights. Additionally, the two lights closer together were at the front and the otherfurther away light was at the rear facing the pursuing jet. This made thecraft to appear to be moving in reverse. It should be noted, that the color of the triangular craft lights were anunusual milky white color, nothing like that of the very bright red, greenand white lights observed on the jet. Tinker Air Force Base, which does have fighters, is located about 25 mileseast of my house. I assure you that this is a true account of what I observed on the stateddate and time.NUFORC Note: We spoke with this witness via telephone on two occasions,and we found him to be quite objective in his description of the allegedsighting, and very well organized in his description of what it was heapparently witnessed. We have invited him to contact media and law enforcement offices, to inquirewhether anyone else might have been witness to the event. Also, he willcontact the FAA ARTCC in Oklahoma City, to inquire whether the controllerson duty Friday night, May 27, might know what the cause of the incident was.We have to allow for the possibility that the object apparently beingpursued by what may have been a military fighter jet may have been an F-22""Raptor"" fighter on a test flight, but even that aircraft would have to havedisplayed conventional red and green marker lights on its wing tips. The witness will submit an illustration of what the lights on the objectlooked like to him, as he viewed it from the ground.

1971, ,"['US Aircraft Carrier Stopped by a UFO! in Bermuda Triangle, 1971This encounter occurred in 1971, while aboard the aircraft carrier, USS John F. Kennedy CVA-67 (now CV-67) in the Bermuda Triangle. I was assigned to the communications department of the Kennedy and had been in this section about a year. The ship was returning to Norfolk, VA after completing a two week operational readiness exercise (ORE) in the Caribbean. We were to stand down for 30 days, after arriving in Norfolk, Virginia, to allow the crew to take leave and visit family before deploying to the Mediterranean for six months. I was on duty in the communications center. My task was to monitor eight teletypes printing the ""Fleet Broadcasts"". On the top row were four teletypes each printing messages from four different channels. On the bottom row were four more doing the exact same thing except the signal was carried on different frequencies. If one of the primary receivers started taking ""hits"" I would be able to retrieve the message from the bottom one. I also notified Facilities Control of any hits so they could tune the receivers. On the other side of the compartment(room) was the NAVCOMMOPNET (Naval Communications Operations Network). This was the Ship to Shore circuit with the top teletype being the receive and the bottom as the send (known as a duplex circuit). Next to this was the Task Group Circuit for ship to ship communications (task group operations or TGO). It was in the evening, about 20:30 (8:30 PM) and the ship had just completed an eighteen hour ""Flight Ops"". I had just taken a message off one of the broadcasts and turned around to file it on a clip board. When I turned back to the teletypes the primaries were typing garbage. I looked down to the alternates which were doing the same. I walked a few feet to the intercom between us and the Facilities Control. I called them and informed them of the broadcasts being out. A voice replied that all communications were out. I then turned and looked in the direction of the NAVCOMMOPNET and saw that the operator was having a problem. I then heard the Task Group operator tell the watch officer that his circuit was out also. In the far corner of the compartment was the pneumatic tubes going to the Signal bridge (where the flashing light and signal flag messages are sent/receive). There is an intercom there to communicate with the Signal Bridge and over this intercom we heard someone yelling ""There is something hovering over the ship!"" A moment later we heard another voice yelling. ""IT IS GOD! IT\'S THE END OF THE WORLD!"".  We all looked at each other, there were six of us in the Comm Center, and someone said, ""Lets go have a look!"". The Comm Center is amidships, just under the flight deck, almost in the center of the ship. We went out the door, through Facilities Control and out that door, down the passageway (corridor) about 55 feet to the hatch that goes out to the catwalk on the edge of the flight deck (opposite from the ""Island"" or that part of the ship where the bridge is). If you have ever been to sea, there is a time called the time of no horizon. This happens in the morning and evening just as the sun comes up or goes down over the horizon.  During this time you cannot tell where the sea and sky meet. This is the time of evening it was. As we looked up, we saw a large, glowing sphere. Well it seemed large, however, there was no point of reference. That is to say, if the sphere were low; say 100 feet above the ship, then it would have been about two to three hundred feet in diameter. If it were say 500 feet about the ship then it would have been larger. It made no sound that I could hear. The light coming from it wasn\'t too bright, about half of what the sun would be. It sort of pulsated a little and was yellow to orange.  We didn\'t get to looked at it for more than about 20 seconds because General Quarters (Battle stations) was sounding and the Communication Officer was in the passageway telling us to get back into the Comm Center. We returned and stayed there (that was out battle station). We didn\'t have much to do because all the communication was still out. After about 20 minutes, the teletypes started printing correctly again. We stayed at General Quarters for about another hour, then secured. I didn\'t see or hear of any messages going out about the incident.  Over the next few hours, I talked to a good friend that was in CIC (combat information center) who was a radar operator. He told me that all the radar screens were just glowing during the time of the incident. I also talked to a guy I knew that worked on the Navigational Bridge. He told me that none of the compasses were working and that the medics had to sedate a boatswains mate that was a lookout on the signal bridge. I figured this was the one yelling it was God. It was ironic that of the 5,000 men on a carrier, that only a handful actually saw this phenomenon. This was due to the fact that flight Ops had just be completed a short time before this all started and all the flight deck personnel were below resting. It should be noted that there are very few places where you can go to be out in the open air aboard a carrier. From what I could learn, virtually all electronic components stopped functioning during the 20 minutes or so that what ever it was hovered over the ship. The two Ready CAPs (Combat Air Patrol), which were two F-4 Phantoms that are always ready to be launched, would not start.  I heard from the scuttlebutt (slang - rumor mill) that three or four ""men in trench coats"" had landed, and were interviewing the personnel that had seen this phenomena. I was never interviewed, maybe because no one knew that I had seen it.  A few days latter, as we were approaching Norfolk, the Commanding and Executive Officers came on the closed circuit TV system that we had. They did this regularly to address the crew and pass on information. During this particular session the Captain told us how well we did on the ORE and about our upcoming deployment to the Mediterranean. At the very end of his spiel, he said ""I would like to remind the crew, that certain events that take place aboard a Naval Combatant Ship, are classified and are not to be discussed with anyone without a need to know"". This was all the official word I ever received or heard of the incident.  Being young and excited about my visit home and going to the Med, I completely forgot about it until years later when my wife and I went to see ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" at the movies when it first came out. In fact the friend that had been the radar operator was with his wife and went with us. As we walked across the parking lot to my car, I ask him if he remembered what We had experienced years earlier on the ship. He looked at me and said he never wanted to talk about it again. As he said it he turned a little pale. I never talked about the incident again. When I discovered ""Aliens and Strange Phenomenon"" on MSN and started reading the posts I started thinking about it again. Now I seem obsessed in finding out all I can about this phenomena. source:Jim Kopf Mt. Airy, Maryland Submitted to UFO Casebook', '1971 Bizarre UFO Encounter at Texas Uranium Mine  The summer of 1971, I was working the night shift for Conoco Oil Co. at an open pit uranium mine west of Karnes City Tx.    I was one of 6 people operating Caterpillar 657B earth movers. We were down to about 210 feet deep when this incident happened. It was about 11:10 PM , just after shift change we were getting ready to crank our machines, when the 85 acre pit lit up as if it was daylight. The light was so bright that I had to squint because it hurt my eyes. I remember hearing a high pitched hissing noise and the hair on my arms stood on end. I was so scared, I fell to the ground and started praying. I remember trying to look up, but the light was so bright I couldn\'t. After about 2 minutes, the light started getting dimmer and I could finally look up at it. What I saw amazed me. The object was round and the bright light was coming from the center of the bottom of the UFO. Around the perimeter of the craft was hundreds of penlight size light beams that alternated in all colors of the spectrum. Now I know they were laser beams. The UFO was rising up slowly at first and then went straight up out of sight in about 10 seconds. I was crying and shaking and so was everyone else. The other shift workers thought we were crazy when we told them what had happened. But we got the last laugh. This is how we proved it actually happened.    There is a vein of uranium ore that runs from George West Texas to almost Texarkana Texas. When determining where to place a mine, the following steps are accomplished: (1) A geologist with a geiger counter flies over the area and finds the highest radiation reading. (2) Drilling trucks are sent out and core samples are drilled to determine the highest concentration of uranium ore. These core samples are drilled in a grid pattern and every core sample is given a tracking number and logged in showing the concentration and amount of uranium present. (3) The open pit mine is then laid out according to these core samples.    When this UFO incident happened, we were about 2 feet away from a layer of hard rock called the ""tap rock"" that laid directly on top of the uranium ore. The uranium ore varied in depth from 6 to 18 inches and had about the same brown color as low grade coal. Two days after this incident, the tap rock was removed to expose the uranium ore. We were astounded to find that the uranium ore was now a chalky white substance that had NO radioactivity at all! There was a 250 foot diameter circle of this chalky material in the center of the pit.    Outside of the circle, the uranium ore was still as potent as before the incident. Core samples don\'t lie. This chalky material was uranium before this incident.    Many a night I have laid in my bed thinking about what happened. I think the UFO needed the uranium for some reason.

Please consider. Thank you.LoriOriginally Compiled by Albert RosalesAfter 1970 went out with a whimper, 1971 began in much the same manner, but a trend was beginning to form. High strangeness reports were becoming more and more commonplace, memories of 1966-1968 came alive. Something was coming down the pipe; something incredible was going to happen. A change was in the air, 1973 was just around the corner, and the world would never be the same.Location. North of Edwards AFB, CaliforniaDate: Summer 1971Time: unknownA small mushroom-shaped craft crashed close to Edwards AFB. It was dull gray (gun-metal) in color with greenish lights, about 3-3, 5 m in diameter and 1.5-2m in height. 3 gray humanoids, including one that was still alive and a human female abductee (Lorraine Dvorak Cordini) were found onboard. The craft, bodies and survivors were moved to Edwards AFB. The witness Debbie Clayton reported that she heard a loud roaring sound and then a loud crash. Outside she could see a cloud of dust several blocks away. She walked over to the crash site and while other civilians were studying the craft, the military arrived, weapons drawn. One of the civilians had been taken photographs and an Air Force officer ripped the camera from his hands and smashed it but didn\'t try to remove the film. The craft had no markings but seemed to be scratched.There were no windows or seams, and it appeared to be molded in one piece. The texture was smooth. The military told the witnesses to leave or be arrested. The military then covered the craft with a large canvas and lifted it with cables attached to the canvas. Once it was loaded, the military left and there was no mention of the incident in the newspapers. The cause of the crash was later established to have been a technical malfunction. Lorraine Dvorak Cordini later was able to remember (despite the fact that the military attempted to erase her memory with the use of drugs, hypnosis, etc) that she had been traveling onboard the UFO from a mothership in space. She was dressed in a tight-fitting pink body suit. Three extraterrestrial crewmen were returning her to Earth in a small pod-like craft. Lorraine soon found herself standing amid the wreckage. One dead alien was far to her left, barely visible from where she stood, another dead alien was about 20 feet in front of her. A military person was apparently kicking the alien\'s dead body. The third alien crewmember was alive and standing about 20 feet from her, dazed, confused and disoriented. She too felt this way. Suddenly she felt a jerk as a military person grabbed her arms, brought them around her back and handcuffed her. As they were hauling her off she received an image in her mind of the ""captain"" onboard the mothership. It was a tall, 6\' humanoid in a long white gown, short brown hair, female, which was communicating to Lorraine how sorry she was for not being able to help her and the other aliens, for if they did they would be detected. Her sorrow was apparent. Other aliens were around her and the same feelings of helplessness and frustration were felt. The other aliens resembled small gray humanoids (similar to the ones seen in the movie ""Close Encounters""). Lorraine was then thrown into the backseat of a black limousine. Her next memory was what surfaced in the hypnosis session. Lorraine was lying on a cold metal table in a hangar. Three military persons stood to the left of the table. One may have been an officer because he had a different cap than the fatigue uniforms of the other two persons. Another uniformed military man was at Lorraine\'s head and to the right and to his left was an alien whom Lorraine described as having a pumpkin-shaped head. He had appeared in a childhood experience that previously surfaced during the same hypnosis session. In the childhood experience he was in a spacesuit... Lorraine\'s child\'s mind saw him dangling outside the window in a deep sea diver\'s suit. This alien was about 4 ft tall, his body bulbous and brown. His head bulbous and pumpkin like. Lorraine ""heard"" the alien thinking how great he felt about himself and how proud he was to be in the service of the earth military men... he had a smug attitude and the military man next to him showed contempt towards the alien. She was very confused and disoriented. Her next memory was of being yanked off the table and being dragged outside the hangar. There she saw many flashing red lights and screamed, ""My God, that isn\'t a space ship that is the police, my God it is the police."" The military men then sat her on a bus and she ended up in San Francisco stranded and lost.HC addendumSource: Anton Anfalov, CSETIType: H & G?High Strangeness Index: 9Reliability of Source: 10 (Scale of 1-10)Type G: When there is direct contact or interaction between a witness or witnesses with the human or entity, either against as a result of a forced abduction or a voluntary contact.Type H: When there is a report of an alleged crash or force landing of a UFO with recovery of its occupants.

This case has never been debunked, and is still considered as one of the very best physical trace cases involving a UFO landing. Sixteen year old Ron Johnson, along with his dog Snowball, was tending the family sheep when his attention was suddenly drawn to a mushroom-shaped UFO appearing in the night sky. The flying object, metallic with multi-colored lights,  was hovering approximately 75 feet away from Ron among some trees. Johnson estimated the craft was only a few feet above the ground. He estimated the crafts diameter at 6-8 feet.Stunned by what he was looking at, he tried to get a closer look, but the brilliant luminance of the craft did not allow him to make out any additional details. Ron described the craft as making a loud sound, ""like an old washing machine which vibrates."" The glow of the objects bottom increased as it began to rise up into the sky. Ron would later state that he was temporarily blinded by the brightness of the craft as it ascended. After he regained his sight and composure, he ran back to the family house to alert his mother and father, Erma and Durel. The bright,  glowing object was now even higher in the sky.Ron\'s parents came running around the side of the house to get a glimpse of the unusual phenomena.  They arrived just in time to see the object, now big as the full moon, as it disappeared from view. The three Johnsons were shocked to see a glowing ring on the ground, right below where the craft had hovered. There was also a glowing material on some of the trees nearby. Family members would agree that the ground around the glow ""felt strange, like a slick crust, as if the soil was crystallized."" Ron\'s mother\'s fingers went numb, like she had been given a local anesthetic. After they were sure the craft was not returning,  the family settled down for the night.When dawn broke the next day, the family immediately returned to the sight of the glowing ring, and to their surprise, it was still there! The inside and outside of the ring was damp from a rain shower, but the exterior of the ring was amazingly dry. The ring had a crusty appearance, as though the rain had simply ran off, leaving it bone dry. Slightly over a month later, after a snow fall, the white ice had melted both inside and outside of the ring, but the ring itself maintained the snow drift. Investigators experimented with the ring by removing snow from a section of it, and pouring water on the exposed part. The soil would not allow the water to pass through.The Johnsons told their story to the local newspaper, The Delphos Republican.  Reporter Thaddia Smith, along with several members of her family,  drove back out with the Johnsons to see the site of the UFO landing and the strange ring.  Smith\'s report was as follows:""The circle was still very distinct and plain to see. the soil was dried and crusted. The circle or ring was approximately 8 feet across, the center of the ring and the outside area were still muddy from recent rains. The area of the ring that was dried was about a foot across and was very light in color.The object had crushed a dead tree to the ground either when it landed or took off, and from appearance had broken a limb of a live tree when it landed. the broken limb was most unusual, it would snap and break as though it had been dead for quite some time, yet it was green under the bark, and the upper area still had green leaves clinging to its branches. However the lower area looked as though it had been blistered and had a whitish cast. ""Later the same day, Sheriff Enlow, Undersheriff Harlan Enlow, and Kansas State Highway Patrolman Kenneth Yager investigated the ring after being alerted to the factis of the case by Thaddia Smith. Harlan Enlow filed this report:""...we observed a ring shaped somewhat like a doughnut with a hole in the middle. The ring was completely dry with a hole in the middle and outside of the ring mud. There were limbs broken from a tree and a dead tree broken off there. There was a slight discoloration on the trees."" Further experimentation showed the ground under the ring to be dry to a depth of one foot. The ring itself was composed of a whitish substance, which was sent to a laboratory for analysis. The findings were as follows: [it was resolved into fibers which] was vegetal in nature and belonged to an organism of the order of Actinomycetales, which is an intermediate organism between bacteria and fungus... family actiniomycete, genus Nocardia... [and is] often found together with a fungus of the order Basidomycetes, which may flouresce under certain conditions... one possible interpretation is that high energy stimulation triggered the spectacular growth of the Nocardia and of an existing fungus, and caused the latter to flouresce. There would also be another witness to corroborate Ron Johnson\'s account of the UFO. Sheriff Enlow told the press;""On 11-03-71 Mr. Lester Ensbarger of 416 Argyle St. in Minneapolis advised Deputy Sheriff Leonard Simpson that at approx. 7:30 p.m. 11-02-71 he had observed a bright light descending in the sky in the Delphos area."" The experience of Ron Johnson is still considered as one of the best documented ""ground trace"" UFO cases of the past century, and is still unexplainable by any conventional or earthly means. ', '1971, St. Lorenzen, Styria, Austria / Rudi Nagora PhotographsOn September 24, 1959, just before dawn, police officer Robert Dickerson was cruising the city streets in his patrol car when he noticed a bright falling object like a meteor. But instead of ""burning out,"" the object took on a larger, ball-like appearance, stopped abruptly, and hovered about 200 feet above the ground. Its glow lit up juniper trees below it.   The patrolman watched the UFO for several minutes, then drove toward it on Prineville Highway, turning in at the airport. The UFO, meanwhile changed color from bright white to a duller reddish-orange color, and dived rapidly to a new position NE of the airport.     The object flew over Redmond Airport, situated southeast of the city of Portland and hovered over the field, where it was observed for several minutes by FAA officials.     At the FAA office, Flight Service Specialist Laverne Wertz had just completed making weather observations minutes before, and had seen nothing unusual. Now Patrolman Dickerson, Wertz, and others studied the hovering object through binoculars. The UFO was round and flat, with tongues of ""flame"" periodically extending from the rim.     At 1310Z (5:10 am. PST) official logs show, the UFO was reported to Seattle Air Route Control Center. Logs of the Seattle center show that the report was relayed to Hamilton AFB. The Seattle log continues:     ""UFO also seen on the radar at Klamath Falls GCI [Ground Control Intercept] site. F-102\'s scrambled from Portland.""     Six F-102 fighters were scrambled from Portland. As they took off, the Air Force radioed the pilots of a B-47 bomber and a F-89 fighter on routine flights nearby, ordering them to join the chase.     As the Redmond Observers studied the UFO, they noticed a high speed aircraft approaching from the southwest. The Redmond log continues:     ""As aircraft approached, UFO took shape of mushroom, observed long yellow and red flame from lower side as UFO rose rapidly and disappeared above-clouds.""     The UFO was seen again briefly, hovering about 25 miles south of the airport. Radar continued to show the UFO south of Redmond for about two hours, at various altitude changing from 5.000 feet to 52.000 feet.   sources/references http://www.chez.com/lesovnis/htm/redmond59.htm Portland Oregon Air Traffic Controller report', 'Navy Officer Has UFO \'Close Encounter\' along Secluded CA HighwayAn off duty Navy petty officer second class had just gotten off duty at California\'s then Naval Air Station Miramar when his vehicle suddenly shut off along a dark and secluded piece of Interstate 15.As the man retrieved a gas can from his trunk for what could be a long walk into nearby Kearny Mesa - he hears an unusual sound - ""a release of air"" - that draws his attention into the darkness on the other side of the four-lane highway. He sees ""an object of some type that is long, low and extremely streamlined and silohutted."" The year is 1971.Following is his original account of the incident. Only minor editing changes were completed.Original reportIn 1971, I had a close encounter that was later explained to me was a ""Close Encounter of The Second Kind"". My understanding is that a sighting in the sky is an encounter of the first kind, an encounter where the craft has touched down within close range is the second kind and an encounter where there is physical contact is the third kind, such as the movie years ago.Many years prior to the movie, I was on my way home after getting off duty from the Naval Station at Miramar, which is now a Marine Corp Air Station, in San Diego. The year is 1971, it is about 3:00 a.m. there is no traffic and I am headed down interstate 15 and my car is running on gas fumes.About 5 miles from my destination, the vehicle suddenly shuts off and I coast over to the side of the road. I am thinking I am out of gas and would have to walk the rest of the way into the next surburb of Kearny Mesa. I get out of the car and there is no traffic and it is very dark with only a little moonlight. I get a 5 gallon red military issue gas can out of the trunk and stand there trying to figure out what to do. I was flat broke and it was still a week before payday.As I look North and South on the Interstate, not a soul can be seen.A craft silently landsStill looking South as I stand there by the driver side of the door, I hear a release of air as if it is coming from a high pressure nozzle,  and I hear gravel crunching like something heavy is pressing it down. I look across the Interstate which in 1971 was only four lanes and see an object of some type that is long, low and extremely streamlined and silohutted.I keep looking because I was wondering how something could be there when it was not there when I got out of the car and as dark as it was, I never saw any lights or heard any other car engines. At this time, I was still thinking I was looking at an extremely long car kind of like a limousine, but it was much longer. There was total silence and no movement from the vehicle or on the Interstate.Panic took over when I saw that the vehicle was sitting flush on the ground and their were no tires, plus, I could see that it had opaque silver type windows that were paneled, but no other things like door handles or anything that could make it a car. My mind starting putting together the fact that this was no car and the noise I heard earlier was the craft settling down about 40 yards across the Interstate from me. I was scared to death at this point,  and jumped into the car. The only thing I could think of was getting out of there before something came out of the craft.Even though I thought the car would not start, I turned the key and it started and I put it into gear and took off.When I got home, my family got scared because I was in tears and really scared. They had never seen me in this shape before and it frightened them. I told them what I had seen and they believed me, because they knew I was too terrified to make it up.Return to the sceneThe following morning, I went to my neighbor\'s house and asked him to go back with me. We tried the car, but it would not start, it was out of gas. We borrowed money from other neighbors and went back to where the incident occurred. We only saw a slight indentation in the gravel where something had been.I was traumatized by the event and had trouble sleeping for a long time after that. I still cannot sleep with my back to a door. When it first happened, I was so shook up, that I talked to doctors who recommended that I undergo hypnosis to digress to the night of the incident. They kept asking me exactly how long was I there that night and to me it only seemed like a few minutes from start to finish. Others say that I could have been there longer and just do not know it and may have seen more than what I thought.I never underwent the hypnosis, because I do not want to know anymore than what I already know. I know what I saw that night and it will haunt me the rest of my life.Blemish appears on lower calfLater that year, a blemish appeared on the left inside of my lower calf above the ankle. It is about the size of a dime and it has never gone away. Right in the center is a little black dot surrounded by a lighter tan circle. I thought it was some type of skin cancer and went in for a check up, the doctors say no, they have no idea what it is other than a blemish and not to be concerned. Well, I am concerned because I do not know really how long I was there and what happened from the time I stopped to the time I left. I could be from the encounter, but I have no idea.I have seen objects from time to time since then, but they have been in the sky and usually others report them. I have not ever had another close encounter and really do not want to.Thanks for listening, it is good to vent that story from time to time. I just look forward to the day when all of us can be validated when a sighting beyond comparison will take place and it cannot be disputed.Additional descriptionThe craft was a grayish type color and very smooth in appearance. The shape was very aerodynamic with the length being about 18-20 ft. The height was about 6ft. from the bottom of the craft to the top of the slightly dome-shaped top in the center of the craft. There was also what looked like some type of windows or pane devices that were very dark, like a really dark tint on a car or presidential vehicle, but it was not glass, it was some other type of alloy. Although the vehicle looked really light in weight, it had to be heavy,  because it made the gravel crunch as it settled on the shoulder on the side of the roadway. I was standing by the 1968 Plymouth Fury, light blue, on the southside of the interstate, looking across the interstate to the east, that is the direction I heard the escaping rush of air and heard the gravel crunching. UCSD has an observatory of some type now in the area near the sighting. At the time I was there in 1971, a red & white checkered water tank was in the field close by the interstate.']"

And some purported UFOs aren\'t UFOs at all. Take the example from Apollo 16. (Editor\'s Note: This is a prime example of a photographic case that at first seems compelling, but in time, as more information is garnered, a sensible resolution is discovered. Also, this is another reason that the study of UFOs is more profitable when examining older cases that have stood the test of time, yet remain unsolved.)Image above: High-resolution, digital scan of a full frame from the original Apollo 16 film showing the object in question (top center) and its position relative to the moon. Reflections in the window are also visible (left and right). Credit: NASA Beginning their return from the moon to an April 27, 1972, splashdown, Astronauts John Young, Thomas Mattingly and Charles Duke captured about four seconds of video footage of an object that seemed to look a lot like Hollywood\'s version of a spacecraft from another world.Image at right : Image enhancement of the object and linear feature. Credit: NASA The thing was described as ""a saucer-shaped object with a dome on top."" The images were captured with a 16mm motion picture camera shooting at 12 frames per second from a command/service module window. The object appears momentarily near the moon. As the camera pans, it moves out of the field of view. It reappears as the camera pans back. It appeared in about 50 frames.Some very bright people recently worked hard to analyze that footage. Their conclusion was that the object wasn\'t at all what some observers thought it seemed to be. There is no indication the Apollo 16 crew ever thought the film showed anything special.A group headed by Gregory Byrne of Johnson Space Center\'s Image Science and Analysis Group completed a report on its investigation earlier this year. They used a video copy of the film initially, then did a high-resolution digital scan of the original film for detailed analysis.They stabilized images to correct for camera movement, and then aligned multiple frames in a sequence. One thing that showed them was that the object appeared to move slightly with respect to the moon, because of parallax brought about by slight camera motions and the nearness of the object to the camera.The investigators also combined several frames in a sequence, to give them higher resolution and greater contrast than individual frames. The combinations showed them more clearly a ""linear feature"" attached to one side of the object. They also looked at archived images from other Apollo missions.Bottom line: ""All of the evidence in this analysis is consistent with the conclusion that the object in the Apollo 16 film was the EVA [spacewalk] floodlight/boom. There is no evidence in the photographic record to suggest otherwise.""', 'Fourth Report Received, March 14, 2008TV/Radio: http://www.ufosnw.com/sighting_reports/2008/longbeachca11142008/longbeachca11142008.htmhttp://www.ufosnw.com/sighting_reports/2008/longbeachca11142008/longbeachca11142008.htmThis is UFOs Northwest and a rather nice outfit. William is the owner and researcher running the site and because of how long we are looking up every night, we have made 2 prior reports that were unexplained.Thank you for posting these sightings and thank you to the woman in Los Angeles who had the strength to report to you! Yeah! We aren\'t insane!My husband works in Law Enforcement for the Department of Defense and I am in police and military technical advising for television and film, just so you are aware. We both have extensive knowledge of conventional and some unconventional aircraft and this was like nothing we\'ve ever seen.Fourth Report Received, March 14, 2008I was walking my Scotty dog after dark at 6:42 and looked up in the sky and saw a large v-shaped grouping of lights, it seemed about 6 or so starlight intensity lights on each side of the leading edges of the wings of the ""v"". The only thing I can compare it to would be the flying wing bombers of the 50s except all I saw were the lights. I first thought it was a jet, but it was too big, flying too slowly, and not making any noise for it to be so big/close to the ground if it was that close. There was no way to scale the object, which makes it somewhat frustrating. I was trying my best to figure out what size the object was as I was watching it in total disbelief. I held on to a light pole to steady myself as I was looking up at it fly from south to a north/slightly northeast direction. The only speed I could compare it to would be a jet at crushing altitude of 40,000 feet, so it seemed to be flying somewhat slow. At that height its size would be very small. I read later about someone in Brazil who saw something that she was able to scale with her fingers held 3 to 4 inches apart at arm\'s distance. That is how big the object seemed to me. It seemed to be BIG. The lights were the color of dim starlight, so it wasn\'t something that would stand out and would be easily overlooked unless you had the fortunate opportunity to look directly in its direction. If 90 degrees was straight up, I saw it at an angle of about 70 degrees, 20 degrees to the west from straight up. It did have red blinking lights at the ends of the wings, one red light on the wing on the far side of me, and two red blinking lights on the side closest to me. I usually look up at the all the planes flying around the area, and my location being about 6 to 7 miles west of downtown Los Angeles, there are a lot of planes in the sky.The object crossed the flight path of planes landing at LAX coming in from the ocean flying from west to east before they turn over downtown L. A. to fly into the airport. I thought planes flying in the air would have had to of seen it, how could they not unless it was higher than they were. Without anything to scale it to, there was no way of knowing how big or how fast it was going, and this is what is still frustrating to me, that I can\'t figure something that defies any logical explanation or description. One thing I did make sure to do was to see if the object would block out any stars/starlight that it passed under. The starlight was not blocked out, even between the lights at the leading edge of the object. I can only assume the lights were on the leading edge of the object, but maybe they were at the bottom of it, as it passed from view at about 30 degrees from the horizon. Also deciduous trees were beginning to hide it from view. If it weren\'t for the trees I would have seen it at its end as the guy and his girlfriend in the San Fernando Valley would be beginning to see it at 7 PM as they had mentioned in their description. A few minutes prior to 6:42 PM, a neighbor with his dog was walking away from the object\'s direction and a jogger was also headed away as well. They both passed us and disappeared from view. When I saw it I was totally alone except for the dog who was sniffing a bush, she wouldn\'t have cared if she saw anything anyway. It was a situation of wanting to shout ""Hey come out and look at this!"" but I didn\'t want to take my eyes off of it for fearing of losing my sight of it. It seemed somewhat majestic and beautiful slowly flying across the sky, I thought, as I was looking at it. My nickname for it is also ""Battlestar Galactica,"" and I have referred to it as that since I saw it. I only today, March 8, 2009, have read the other peoples\' descriptions, the people from the San Fernando Valley (MUFON 14894), and the family from Long Beach, so I am another who can be added to the list and am wondering who else could have seen it, as it flew over an area of millions of people. I called KTLA Channel 5 and talked to someone there about it, as I expected other people who saw it would call in and maybe it would have been mentioned in the 10 o\'clock news that night, but it never was talked about. There have to be many others who will hopefully someday read of our shared experience and also write of this fantastic, although unsettling experience. It is something that I think about almost every day when I have some time to myself. Hopefully I have remembered most of the pertinent information. Unfortunately I do not have a computer and am using my mother\'s computer. I have left information that will allow those at MUFON to contact me, and I would like some day to meet the people in the Valley, specifically, as it was unbelievable that he was describing the direction and time frame of the object as it passed from the South, where I was, to the North, to where they were, within the approximate time frames. Thanks,Mark ', 'Large, Unknown Object Reported to Crash near Needles, CaliforniaGeorge Knapp, Chief Investigative ReporterI-Team: New UFO Mystery SurfacesUpdated: July 28, 2008 11:51 PM CDT  A large object with a turquoise hue plummeted out of the sky earlier this summer and plowed into the earth south of Las Vegas near Needles, California. Eyewitnesses say this was no meteorite, especially since a bunch of helicopters came looking for it and then hauled it away. The object was seen in the early morning hours of May 14. It appeared to crash into the ground just west of the Colorado River. And that\'s when things got interesting for residents of the area. Somewhere in the rough terrain just west of the Colorado River and south of Needles is a point of impact, maybe some burn marks, created by something that fell from the sky. Frank Costigan saw it because he got up at 3 a.m. to let his cat out -- a fiery object that flashed across the sky, but it wasn\'t a meteor he says.""It was bright, bright enough that it illuminated the ground,"" he said.For seven years, Costigan worked as the chief of airport security at L.A.X.  He says the mystery object flew out of the north east, heading southwest, traveling very fast, but at one point it slowed down, then sped up again. ""It went behind a hill, and I waited to see if I could hear it crash because as big as it was, it was bound to make noise,"" he said.But he didn\'t hear a crash. Hours later, David Hayes, the owner of KTOX Radio in Needles, was coming to work when he spotted an odd formation of dark vehicles getting off the highway. He drew a picture of the lead vehicle, a large truck with a dome on top and a black structure that reminded him of a stealth fighter.""It seemed like it was some kind of surveillance vehicle -- four-wheel drive. It had government plates, U.S. government plates and behind it were a couple of vans that looked like support vehicles,"" said Hayes. The men inside had a military bearing, Hayes said, but weren\'t in uniform. He made eye contact with one of the drivers and the guy followed him. Later in the day, one of the vehicles was parked outside the station, seemingly conducting a surveillance of the place.""These guys staring you down had a \'Men in Black\' feel to it?"" asks Knapp.""Absolutely. Very serious, serious as a heart attack,"" said Hayes.Coincidentally, Costigan, the ex-cop, works on investigations for Hayes. When he came in to the radio station, he told Hayes about the thing he had seen in the sky, and Hayes told him about the Men in Black.Then they got another piece of the puzzle -- a call from a man who lives in a houseboat on the river, who said he saw the fiery object -- that it had crashed about 100 yards west of the river, that it landed with a thump. Hayes says he\'s known the witness for years by the name Bob on the river. Bob thought a plane had crashed and tried to call 911 but his cell wouldn\'t work, so he moved his boat out into the river, and then heard the helicopters. In an interview with journalist Linda Howe, Bob says he saw at least five helicopters flying in formation, including a large sky crane. The crane picked up the oval shaped object, still glowing, and flew away, heading in the direction of Las Vegas. One odd detail, the choppers arrived only 17 minutes after the object crashed. He described it to Hayes. ""It was about the size of a semi-trailer, he says, oblong shaped thing,"" said Hayes.Out of the blue, the station got a call from a friend in Laughlin who said the Laughlin Airport had been inundated on the night of the crash with so-called Janet planes. That\'s the airline that flies workers to top secret Area 51. Costigan says the airport could not confirm this because no one is on duty after 6 p.m. at night, not even in the tower.The black vehicles have left Needles. Bob the houseboat guy can\'t be found either. ""The fact that there were people here the next day, it was almost like they were doing some sort of cleanup or whatever. The point is, something definitely happened.The I-Team phoned nearly every agency we could think of to see if they had received any report or knew anything. We were not surprised to learn that no one knew anything.Here\'s the list -- police agencies in three states, the Laughlin Airport, the weather service, the FAA and several military bases. A military watchdog group found a public record showing there was at least one army helicopter in the air in that area at that time. The helicopter, oddly enough, is listed as being attached to a U.S. base in Europe. We are filing freedom of information requests and will report back when we get responses.', 'Credits & Acknowledgements(Editor\'s Note-Update-On 12-27-08, Chris Bledsoe Sr. contacted me, and pointed out some factual errors in our original article. Also, he gave me additional information which was not included in the television program which addressed the incident. He also sent me a drawing of the 7\' alien entity which he recalled during his regression. He told me that before the incident, he couldn\'t even draw a stick figure. You can see from the drawing that this is not the case anymore. A big thanks to Mr. Bledsoe for the invaluable information for this intriguing UFO encounter.)An IntroductionThere have been many UFO cases addressed on various television documentaries throughout the years. Many of these are forgettable, many are biased, and then there are a few that present the facts as they are.One of the latter was presented by the MUFON organization in October, 2008. The special was carried by the Discovery Channel. Titled ""UFOs over Earth,"" the hour long show addressed an extremely compelling case of UFO sightings, an alien encounter, and possible alien abduction. On January 8, 2007, this baffling case began in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on the banks of the Cape Fear River.The main witness in this case is one Chris Bledsoe Sr. Bledsoe, a successful builder and commercial pilot, was well liked and respected in his community. On the day of the strange events, he was fishing with four other men, Donny Ackerman, Gene Robinson, David McDonald. and Chris Bledsoe Jr. The relationship between Bledsoe and the other three men was not addressed fully on the TV program, but Mr. Bledsoe informed me that Ackerman, Robinson, and McDonald worked for him as framing subcontractors, and had just finished a large beach home and gotten paid the day of the encounter.They invited Chris Sr. and Jr. to go fishing with them. Bledsoe Sr. said, ""Why not?"" as his wife and three other children were out of town that day. They all rode to the fishing spot in Bledsoe\'s four door pickup truck because it was a four-wheel drive, and could maneuver in the muddy banks of the river.Bledsoe took a walk away from the fishing spot, and spotted three UFOs. He returned to the fishing spot, and pointed out the objects to the other three men. They were frightened by the UFOs, and quickly left the river, seeing the objects again. After Bledsoe arrived home, and went out into his backyard to find out why his dogs were barking. He followed them into the woods, and saw an alien being. After the basic details of Bledsoe\'s encounter were taken by MUFON (Mutual UFO Network) investigators, the UFO group was anxious to gather testimony from Bledsoe\'s fishing buddies, but they had trouble locating the three for a time. This, by no means, lessens the validity of their eyewitness accounts. Rating the authenticity of a UFO sighting as to the social status of a witness was employed by Project Blue Book in the 1960s, and was eventually found to be faulty. There is no evidence at this time to suggest that they made up their stories, or conspired to create a hoax. If they did, they did a remarkable job. All of the accounts given by the three regarding the sighting of the three unknown flying objects were almost identical. Case OverviewThe basic overview of the case is as follows:As the four men were fishing, Bledsoe decided to walk about 75 yards to the tree line. While he stood looking into the sky, he was surprised to see in the distance, two orange lights. As he wondered at the two lights, soon a third zoomed into place on the left of the other two, in the ""blink of an eye.""Bledsoe would later remark that the objects had rapidly flown to their original position, and then stopped dead, as if they had met a cushion of air. Excited and apprehensive about what he had seen, he hurried back to the river bank to tell his three fishing partners. He thought, at the time, that he had been gone about 20 minutes. This assumption would later be found to be faulty.When Bledsoe pointed out the three orange lights to the other three, they turned their attention to the sky. As they watched the lights, they felt that they were ""being invaded."" They saw all three objects slowly descended to the ground, appearing to land approximately 100-150 yards on the opposite side of the river. At least two of the men had seen flares before, and stated that there was no way that the objects were flares. They watched the lights hover in virtually one place for up to ten minutes.They were mesmerized and frightened by what they saw. The scared men dropped their fishing gear, ran to the truck, and sped away. Several of the fishermen saw the lights again as they left the river. They also witnessed a ""large, glowing object"" over a bank of trees. This object was duplicated with computer graphics by McHush, a visual arts expert. It appeared to be oblong, with spikes coming from it. A significant difference in the initial testimony given by the four men was the amount of time that it took Bledsoe to walk down the road apiece, and return to the fishing spot on the banks of Cape Fear. Bledsoe left when it was still light, but when he returned, it was totally dark. After Bledsoe had been gone long enough that the other three became worried about him, two of them jumped in the truck, and drove down the road where Bledsoe had walked, but found no sign of him. When he finally reappeared, they estimated that he had been gone 3 or 4 hours.Bledsoe told me that when he had been gone for a time, Junior went to look for him. Bledsoe Sr. describes the events in his own words:He walked from the fishing spot looking for me. When the other guys drove up the road, he was gone for two hours hiding in the woods. When I got back 4 hours later, the three other guys were at the fishing spot on the river and I asked, ""Where is Junior?"" and they told me that he had left 2 hours earlier on foot looking for me.I told the other guys what I had seen, and they began to tell me that they had been looking for me. I didn\'t talk much at that time because Junior was not there, and I wanted to find him.I walked about 75 yards south to the tree line. Keep in mind, this was away from the only road that came into the river. I was calling for him, and there was no answer. When I stepped into the woods about ten feet calling him, he stood up from under some low bushes he had been hiding in.He grabbed me crying... A 17 year old, 6\'3"" tall, big boy. He asked me:""Dad, where have you been?""""I have been hiding here for a long time. There were 2 creatures walking around looking at me. I could not move when they looked at me. I was so scared... they were picking up bottles and other trash on the ground all the time staying within 20 feet of me watching me."" All this he told me before I told him of the orange orbs and when I got him back the 75 yards to the fishing spot. It was then the heavens looked like the stars were moving around, and three of them came down over our heads and landed just on the other side of the river. What was told on tape to MUFON was that two of the other guys reported seeing the same creature, but they only saw the red eyes walking within the wood line in the direction my son went. When the five of us left in my truck, two of the guys in the back seat saw something. They reported to MUFON that as we were speeding away from the river, they saw a glowing creature running on all fours, chasing the truck.  Still unsettled by what he had seen, Bledsoe arrived home. After a time, he heard his dogs barking in the backyard, obviously upset by something. ""My dogs went nuts!"" Bledsoe remarked.The Entity in the WoodsOne of his dogs, a Chesapeake Bay Retriever, sped into the forest, with the others following. Bledsoe was right on their trail. After tramping through the woods in search of his dogs for a time, he came upon a sight that was beyond belief. Right before him stood a creature!Bledsoe was frozen in his tracks. The being appeared to be the size of a child, and was only 3-4 ft from him. Bledsoe stated that, had he leaned over, he could have touched it with his hand. The being was only about 3 feet tall, as indicated from his description, and its appearance was ""like it had been dipped in glass."" The being had red eyes.As he stared at the being, Bledsoe felt a sense of ""Here I am, if you want me."" He told MUFON investigators that the being was like ""a child... a little person."" In a moment, the other dogs arrived upon the scene, and the being was nowhere to be seen. Bledsoe said that his Chesapeake\'s hair stood up from the back of his neck to the rear end.Bledsoe\'s SonThe MUFON investigators, International Director James Carrion, along with Rich Lang, Steve McGee, Norman Gagnon, and Tim McHush, were very impressed with Bledsoe\'s account of what he had seen that night. They felt that he was being honest with them, even though his story seemed bizarre. Wanting to corroborate his story, they turned next to his son, Chris Bledsoe Jr.Jr. stated that while he was in the backyard of the Bledsoe house, he saw ""two red orbs"" floating through the woods. He claimed that soon he saw a number of the small beings emerge from the woods near the house.There was a concern by investigators as to how much of what Jr. said was true, and if his devotion to his father had caused him to create his story to validate Sr.\'s story. MUFON would now find Ackerman, Robinson, and McDonald, and take their testimony. The Three FishermenThe Three FishermenThe three fishermen related their stories to investigators, indicating that Bledsoe Sr. had indeed left them, walking down the road for a short distance, had been gone 3 or 4 hours, and returned, excitedly pointing out the three orange objects in the sky. They indicated that two of them had driven down the same road Sr. had walked down, saw him nowhere, and returned to their fishing spot. They each described their sighting of the lights in a very similar fashion, and ruled out the possibility that the objects could have been any kind of conventional object, including flares. They also described their sighting of the strange, oblong shaped object. They all indicated that at the time of the sighting, there was a total silence in the area.The MUFON team was very impressed with Bledsoe Sr. and the fishing companions\' testimony, and felt that the next step in their pursuit of the truth should be to have Bledsoe Sr. undergo regressive hypnosis, which often times can unlock hidden memories. The session took place on July 14, 2008. The regression was led by Dr. Michael O\'Connell, a Harvard graduate, and veteran of some 250 regressions. MUFON taped the session.Bledsoe\'s Psychological ConditionIt is important to note that during his visits with MUFON, Bledsoe Sr. had, on a number of occasions, admitted that he had trouble believing what he had seen himself. Facts that he could not recall had caused him confusion, and extremely bad headaches. He attempted to remember more of his encounter, but was unable to accomplish this by himself. This may have had an effect on a subsequent polygraph examination. He wanted to unlock these lost memories, and was a willing participant of any and all techniques that might be beneficial to this end.At one point during the program, Bledsoe\'s wife of many years, and mother of their four children, Yvonne, discussed what the ordeal had done to their family life. Family members had rejected Bledsoe\'s story initially, thinking it too fantastic to be true. For this very reason, Bledsoe did not reveal details of his encounter to others for quite some time, fearing ridicule. But, in time, he felt that unless he recovered the missing elements of the event, he would lose his mind. A great strain had been put on the Bledsoe marriage, but his wife was sure that they would come through it as a family, and the years they had been together would not be lost.The Regressive Hypnosis During the regression, Bledsoe uncovered a number of pertinent and important facts. He described being taken against his will by four, tall, skinny aliens, at least 7 feet tall. He remembered being in a dark, round room, in which he could see various lights and controls. When asked why he was chosen by the aliens, he stated that they were his ""guardian angels,"" and came to him when he was sad. The small alien beings seen by Bledsoe and his son were children of the taller beings. Bledsoe added that the children were playing in the woods.He also revealed that the aliens had been in his house. During his ordeal, he kept telling his captors he wanted only to go home. MUFON investigators were very pleased with the results of the regression, and felt that they were involved in a case for the ages. Before accepting the case as 100% authentic, however, they wanted to make sure that Bledsoe did not have any psychological problems. To this end, they employed the services of Debbie Gioia, a Psychiatric Social Worker.After interviewing Bledsoe and administering a number of psychological tests, Gioia was convinced that Bledsoe was sound of mind, and had no psychological problems that would have caused him to make up his story, or perpetuate a hoax. The MUFON team was relieved, although they were already convinced that Bledsoe was telling them the truth. Gioia\'s findings only confirmed their beliefs.The Polygraph ExaminationCould this case become a classic alien encounter and abduction? All of the evidence to this point indicated yes. However, there was one more hurdle for Bledsoe Sr. to jump over: the polygraph examination. This should be a no brainer, but to complete the puzzle, Bledsoe was given a polygraph by retired FBI analyst, Bob DrDak. The questions that were asked were simple ones, all relating to parts of the case already covered. The MUFON team was very confident that Bledsoe would come through the test with flying colors. This was not to be.According to DrDak, Bledsoe showed deception on some of his answers. In doing research on polygraphs and their operators, I came across some very interesting details that might shed some light on the use, and credibility of the tests.Because it is considered a controversial procedure, polygraph test results cannot be used in court cases, unless both parties agree to its admission. There are many different views concerning polygraph results, both pro and con. There have even been cases where a failed lie-detector test led to the conviction and imprisonment of a murder suspect, only to have the suspect subsequently found to be innocent, and released. It is mainly the use of the polygraph to convict innocent individuals that cause many people to put little, if any, trust in the polygraph examination.The MUFON team was certainly concerned with the results of Bledsoe\'s results. They decided to go to him, and tell him point blank that the tests implied that he was being deceptive on some of his answers. Bledsoe took the assertions calmly, and stated that irregardless of what the machine said, he had told the investigators the truth. Bledsoe\'s earlier concerns about believing his own eyes could have caused him undo nervousness during the test, and account for his failures.I discussed this very problem with a well read UFO Casebook reader, and I would like to include his thoughts on the failed polygraph:I found the hypnosis vs. polygraph results puzzling too.  But I am struck by how often I have read about ""family"" sightings where there is a reluctance to acknowledge what happened that seems to go beyond embarrassment or fear of ridicule, into an induced ""wall"" of anxiety and pain preventing the subject from being discussed. I recall reading about children who grow up and suddenly remember an event that involved the whole family, and while their parents tacitly confirm it, they refuse adamantly to discuss it, almost as if they feel severe emotional distress when they attempt to.Surely this suggests that sometimes human witnesses (or better - victims?) are psychologically manipulated by UFOs to inhibit them from recounting the incident, at least in a credible, coherent fashion.  And couldn\'t that inhibition conceivably manifest itself as untruthfulness to a polygraph operator who is looking to make a simple truth/lie call? I recall the Fayetteville witness saying on several occasions that he sometimes doubted the truth of what he was saying himself.  He seemed deeply conflicted. It would be easy to assume this was because he had fabricated the whole thing, but then how to explain the other three witnesses?Ray Van DuneLingering QuestionsIn 1975, one of the most celebrated UFO abductions cases took place. It became the subject of the move, ""Fire in the Sky,"" with actor D. B. Sweeny portraying the role of Travis Walton.  Walton\'s story tells us that when he was subjected to his first polygraph, he failed. Yet, since that time, Walton has passed many other polygraphs. It was assumed that Walton\'s test was given too soon, when he was still unsure of what had happened, and was still coming to terms with his abduction. This could also be the case for Bledsoe.If the Bledsoe encounter is deemed a hoax, several important questions must be answered. Why did Bledsoe make up his story? Did he want to gain notoriety? Being a humble, low key individual, the answer would be no. Did he think he could make money from his story? Possibly, but it appeared that he was well set financially. And if we assume that his testimony was false, what about the testimony of his son?It could be possible that Bledsoe Jr. made up his story so that his father would not be seem to be a prankster, but if this is true, what about Bledsoe\'s three fishing buddies, Ackerman, Robinson, and McDonald? Could they have been part of a conspiracy? Possibly, but why?They made no money from their testimony, unless Bledsoe paid them, and if so, why? The fact that the MUFON team had trouble finding them would seem to make a conspiracy highly doubtful. If they were involved in a hoax, they would have been readily available to give testimony.If all of the five men involved made up this fantastic story, what about the regressive hypnosis? Although the process is considered less than accurate by some researchers, is it possible that a person could fake his way through it? Could Dr. O\'Connell, a veteran of some 250 such regressions be fooled that easily? The MUFON team certainly trusted O\'Connell, but they also believed Bledsoe.If the story is a lie, how did Bledsoe get through the psychological testing? Can one fake their way through the tests also? Very unlikely.The team of investigators that earnestly looked at the case wanted so much to believe in Bledsoe, and from all indications, it seems they did. There is no way to know for certain if the case is authentic, and we are left with questions, mainly about the polygraph results. It would seem to me that a second polygraph should be given to Bledsoe after a period of emotional and psychological healing. Considering all of the facts of the case, it seems very likely that after Bledsoe comes to terms with what happened to him, he would pass a second, or even third polygraph, like Travis Walton did. If we could reach that point, we would know for certain that something ""not of this world"" happened on January 7, 2008 in Fayetteville, North Carolina.Credits & Acknowledgementswritten by B J Boothpermanent link: http://www.ufocasebook.com/fayettevillenc.htmlsource & references:Chris Bledsoe Sr.MUFON-www.mufon.comDiscovery Channel-""UFOs over Earth""Additional Comments by Ray Van Dune', '2008 - Cardiff Police Film UFO over South WalesFair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

1990, ,"['The Aegean Sea - 08-15-199008-15-1990USOs or Unidentified Submarine Objects have long been observed in Turkish waters. That is, such crafts are often reported to enter, leave, float or travel under the water of seas, lakes and rivers of Turkey.In this respect, the Aegean Sea, the Marmara Sea and the Mediterranean Sea are very active water regions. Below we would get into some further details of the most interesting USO case of all Turkish UFO literature. Here it is.In August of 1990, a strange underwater UFO was seen beneath the waters of the Aegean Sea which lies between Turkey and Greece. What makes this USO encounter so special is that it includes a colored picture of an alleged Unidentified Submersible Object as a physical evidence.Furthermore, we should add that the eye-witness and the USO are both under the water. Naturally, there are some amazing photographs, motion pictures and video-clips of USOs showing that these mysterious objects are diving into, emerging from, sailing or cruising under the water.However, there was no single evidential picture indicating that the alleged submarine UFO and the photographer were both beneath the sea at some fathoms. As far as we know, this alleged USO photo is therefore the first example of its kind.This spectacular USO case occurred at 14:00 (2 pm.), on 15th of August, 1990. Its exact place was at 57 meters deep of Saros Bay or just around Turkish inland waters of the Aegean Sea.One can easily state that Mr. Erol Erkmen is a very reliable and sincere person who has reported this mysterious underwater object. Mr. Erkmen was engaging in a discovery-dive for an old sunken ship together with his friend, named as Mr. Kemal whose surname has been kept as secret, when he suddenly located the alleged USO there.Mr. Erol Erkmen said that he began to feel very strangely as if they were observed by something. Then he looked ahead and saw a greenish light inside the water. However, this mysterious object disappeared so soon. After a while, Mr. Erkmen again located the green object at his left-hand side. Consequently, he thought that the USO might have been maneuvering around them.He observed it for nearly 3 minutes. Then he decided to take a picture of this strange light using an older underwater Kodak camera. Immediately he did what he had thought.As soon as Mr. Erkmen took a snap-shot of that USO, its light went out. However, they had to come out of the water, since their oxygen was just about to die out. Mr. Erol Erkmen said that when he studied the negative very carefully, he saw nothing.On the other hand, when he looked up the printed photochrome, he located a mysterious greenish light in the picture. For his curiosity, he made this photograph enlarged for 300 times. He then became too embarrassed by seeing that there was a disc-shaped object with some greenish light in the alleged photo.If so, what was that? Was it a conventional submarine or a secret man-made vehicle? Was it a kind of phosphorescent underwater organism? Or was it an advanced submersible craft of alien beings? Who knows? Every alternative view has its own pros and cons.Written by Sefer Murat Aksoy, B.A. & M.S. Independent UFO Researcher of TurkeyTurkey USO Sightings: Sefer Murat Aksoy, 1999-2000).', ""Pitlochry UFO Case - The Missing PhotographsWhile most reports of flying saucers are quickly dismissed by defence chiefs, the previously classified papers show the sighting, which took place near Pitlochry in 1990, was taken extremely seriously.A former MoD official who investigated the case told Scotland on Sunday that despite strenuous efforts they could find no earthly explanation for the craft.Witnesses reported seeing a large, diamond-shaped object hanging in the air next to a RAF Harrier above the A9 at Calvine, north of Pitlochry, on August 4, 1990.The UFO is said to have hovered for about 10 minutes before zooming skywards at high speed and disappearing from view.The apparent close encounter of the Caledonian kind was photographed by members of the public whose images appear to show a blurry, diamond-shaped craft next to a jet.Fearing the pictures would spark significant media interest, the MoD decided to bring it to the attention of the Government.A Whitehall official wrote in a memo: “Such stories are not normally drawn to the attention of ministers. “On this occasion, however, the MoD has been provided with six photographic negatives of an alleged UFO… and has been asked for comments almost certainly for inclusion in a forthcoming story.”The memo suggested the media should be told that “no definite conclusion had been reached regarding the large diamond-shaped object”.It has also emerged the MoD went on to commission a series of line drawings of the object the following year.More info from old UFO Casebook article:The photographs have been misplaced, lost, or hidden, and have never surfaced.The MOD's UFO Project had also been sent a number of intriguing photos and videos of UFOs, and had the means to have the images enhanced and analysed by various technical specialists.Some intriguing images had arrived via the Scottish Daily Record in 1990, and a poster-sized photograph had been produced from one of the negatives and pinned to my (?) office wall by one of my predecessors.The photograph had been taken in daylight and showed a vast, diamond-shaped UFO, metallic silver in colour, apparently hovering low over the Scottish countryside.The photograph was removed in 1994 by the then head of the division, who had convinced himself that the picture showed a secret prototype aircraft codenamed Aurora - a hypersonic replacement for the SR-71 Blackbird that the US Government denied existed.A question was asked in Parliament in 1996 about the location of this photograph, and the matter has subsequently been raised in a Freedom of Information Act request. Unfortunately, the photograph had disappeared, and could not be located."", '1990 - The Place Bonaventure Incident - Montreal, Quebec, CanadaFair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

The adventure of 23-year-old Antonio Villas Boas on 16 October 1957 in Brazil is probably the most famous case of interstellar intercourse. Antonio was ploughing a field on the family farm when the engine of his tractor cut out; at the same time, an object with purple lights descended from the sky. Humanoids in spacesuits emerged from the object and took him into their craft, subjecting him to what seemed like a medical examination. They stripped him, spread a strange liquid over him and took a sample of his blood. He was left alone in a room for what seemed a long time, until a beautiful, fair-haired woman arrived. She was naked and Antonio was instantly attracted to her. Without speaking or kissing, they had sex, during which she growled like a dog. Despite his strange circumstances or perhaps because the alien liquid had Viagra-like properties Antonio was soon ready for a second helping. Interviewed later, he said: ""Before leaving she turned to me, pointed to her belly, and smilingly pointed to the sky."" Before letting him go, his captors gave Antonio a guided tour of the spaceship. Antonio went on to become a successful lawyer and still stood by his story over 30 years later. Equally lurid stories of sexual liaisons with UFO occupants came from the world-famous contactees of the 1950s. Howard Menger, for one, had regular meetings with Marla, a beautiful blonde from space who claimed to be 500 years old. She projected ""warmth, love and physical attraction,"" which he found irresistible. Menger divorced his wife to marry Marla (aka Connie Weber). From July 1952, Truman Bethurum had many meetings with Aura Rhanes, the captain of a flying saucer, whom he found to be ""tops in shapeliness and beauty"". Bethurum\'s wife wasn\'t so impressed with this ""queen of women"" and cited Rhanes in her divorce petition. From the late Forties to the early Sixties, female contactees in contrast to today\'s female abductees are few and far between. This is more than made up for by the astonishing story of Elizabeth Klarer, who in 1956 fell in love with Akon, a scientist who took her to his home planet, Meton. There, he seduced her, saying: ""Only a few are chosen for breeding purposes from beyond this solar system to infuse new blood into our ancient race."" This smooth talk worked; ""I surrendered in ecstacy to the magic of his lovemaking,"" she wrote later. Klarer said their ""magnetic union"" produced a perfect and highly intelligent son named Ayling. She was sent back to South Africa alone and died in 1994; as far as we know her starman and son live on somewhere beyond Alpha Centauri. Rather ordinary tales of \'contact\' are thus transformed into heroic fantasies of youthful virility. Antonio Villas Boas claimed to have done what any healthy young man would have done in the same situation; he and Elizabeth Klarer delivered the goods, helping to save an alien race from extinction. Scientific ufologists, more interested in \'hard\' evidence (like radar traces, photographs and forensic samples) condemn this \'wet\' material as too subjective, relegating claims of sexual assault and abduction to the fields of psychology and folklore (which they likewise distrust). The early contactee literature provides a rich variety of such stories and, whatever their validity, it is a pity they have been largely neglected or ridiculed. When ufologist John Keel visited college communities in Northeast America during the mid-1960s, several young women told him they had been raped by aliens, and young men confessed that aliens had extracted their semen. By the 1970s, the idea of hybrid \'space babies\' was more widely known but taken seriously only by UFO cultists who, said Keel, feared, that ""the flying saucer fiends are engaged in a massive biological experiment creating a hybrid race which will eventually take over the Earth."" A decade later, these notions were part of mainstream ufology. Serious researchers some of them academics, like John E. Mack and David Jacobs openly declared their belief that the \'Greys\' were taking sperm and ova from human abductees. It was common to hear female abductees tell of being impregnated, of the ftus taken from their wombs, and of later being shown their hybrid babies in a nursery on a flying saucer. Historically, pregnancy and abortion have been surrounded by a constellation of myths and old wives\' tales and it is, perhaps, no surprise to find UFO mythology being used to explain unexpected pregnancies, \'mysterious\' discharges and missing or malformed babies. In the 1970s, a 19-year-old Californian girl attributed the birth of a blue-skinned, web-footed baby to being gang raped by six blue-skinned web-footed humanoids who attacked her after she watched their spaceship land on a beach. Similar stories of lusty mermen (the ocean has some affinity with space) can be found in folklore and are usually given as explanation for the birth of deformed babies with reptilian or fish-like characteristics. Some researchers are aware of intriguing similarities between the lore of witches and fairies and modern abduction reports, and nocturnal sexual encounters with supernatural beings of all types can be found in most cultures to the present day. In the past, hundreds of men and women confessed (not always under torture) to sexual intercourse with demons. Some shapeshifting demons were said to lie with a man (as a succubus) to obtain sperm and then (as an incubus) impregnate a woman with it. Ufologists, in particular, have been aware of the structural similarities between accounts of fairy and alien encounters. A recent study by James Pontolillo compared 1517th century accounts of sexual relations with demons to 20th century encounters with aliens and concluded that both traditions expressed a fundamental fear of female sexuality but today the male body and mind are just as likely to be under attack. Communion author Whitley Strieber famously described being sodomised by a narrow, 1ft (0.3m)-long alien probe. He felt that, while inside him, it seemed alive and was surprised, on its removal, to find it was a mechanical device. In my own research I have interviewed \'Martin Bolton\' who had visions of, and telepathic communications with, three young space women. On behalf of these entities, he window-shopped for female attire and watched porn films. They were the \'goodies\'; the \'baddies\' beamed pain to his brain and for a three-year period stretched his penis during the night. On several occasions they afflicted him with phantom pregnancies. Ridley Scott\'s movie Alien (1979) dramatised the nature of the alien sexual assaults; the proof of their inhumanity is that they don\'t always differentiate between the sexes or even between species. Historian David Jacobs who offers accounts, in his book, of abductees compelled to have sex with fellow victims while aliens watched speaks for many who believe that the apparently spontaneous experience of abduction by so many different people implies the phenomenon really exists as an objective threat. Yet Rogerson has demonstrated that most of the elements of the abduction narrative appeared together as early as 1967 in ""The Terror Above Us"" by Malcolm Kent. This science fiction novel anticipated such ufological themes as the \'Oz factor\' (the sensation of being transported to a different reality), the supernatural cold, the doorway amnesia (the informant cannot remember what went on inside a room after entering), the alien in disguise, and impersonal scientists experimenting on humans. For good measure, the story also includes a male protagonist having his genitals examined before sex with an alien female. Another critic of the hybrid-breeding idea is British ufologist Peter Brookesmith, who compared the described activities of the alien \'doctors\' with the procedures used by terrestrial fertility specialists. He found that the alien inseminators singularly fail to take their subjects at the premium time for egg removal, namely within 48 hours of ovulation. And the aliens are just as likely to be confused by \'missing\' fetuses as are humans, given the general difficulty of diagnosing pregnancy within the first eight weeks. For all their cosmic superiority, the alien inseminators can make pretty elementary, and farcical, errors. Aliens inserted a long needle into Betty Andreasson\'s navel. They said their purpose had to do with creation and were puzzled to find \'something\' missing. Andreasson had to explain to them that she\'d had a hysterectomy. Whatever the genesis of such reports, we have to consider that folk have reported sexual contact with all manner of supernatural beings throughout history. Either the aliens have been conducting their beastly experiments for millennia, or such stories meet some deep-seated socio-psychological need. Until any solid medical evidence is provided, the latter hypothesis seems the more likely. This article by NIGEL WATSON can be found in Fortean Times 121. It is printed with a fully anotated reference guide. ', 'The Foo-FightersWW II Document Research  (In search of ""Foo-Fighters"") By Andy Roberts (Originally published in: UFO BRIGANTIA No 66, JULY 1990) Every student of the history of UFOs knows of the phenomenon seen during WWII and known as foo-fighters, kraut fireballs or a variety of other names. Basically they were balls of light which followed and hovered around `planes of all nationalities both in daylight and after dark.Research into this subject has been undertaken by myself on behalf of the Fund for UFO Research. Foo-fighter research shows the genesis of the modern UFO age and during my research I came across the old chestnut of the dreaded government ""cover-ups"". For many ufologists WWII is the time when the cover-up really began and there are intimations in many writers\' books (Keel, Fawcett, Good for example) that both the US and UK governments were involved in separate studies of the foo-fighter phenomenon. These subjects are several articles long in themselves and we won\'t go into them here, but for the record so far there is no documentary evidence of a cover-up of WWII UFO sightings, or even much interest on any government\'s part. No, what we are trying to get to here are the facts surrounding one particular case of a WWII foo-fighter sighting, the cover-up implications and how ufology has dealt with it. So, as the walls melt and voices become fuzzy, let me take you back, back, back ... OK, it\'s October 14th 1943 and you\'re a bomb aimer in a B-17 going in amongst the flak for the final run over the ball-bearing factories at Schweinfurt in Germany, a trouser filling experience which us young folk can\'t even begin to imagine, but for this particular bomber wave they had more than flak to contend with. According to Martin Caidin who wrote Black Thursday(1960) which deals exclusively with the Shweinfurt raid: ""During the bomb run of several groups, starting at about the time the Fortresses approached the Initial Point, there occurred one of the most baffling incidents of World War II, and an enigma that to this day defies all explanation."" ""As the bombers of the 384th Group swung into the final bomb run after passing the Initial Point, the fighter attacks fell off. This point is vital, and pilots were queried extensively, as were other crew members, as to the position at that time of the German fighter planes. Every man interrogated was firm in his statement that ""at the time there were no enemy aircraft above."" ""At this moment the pilots and top turret gunners, as well as several crewmen in the Plexiglas noses of the bombers, reported a cluster of discs in the path of the 384th\'s formation and closing with the bombers. The startled exclamations focused attention on the phenomenon and the crews talked back and forth, discussing and confirming the astonishing sight before them."" ""The discs in the cluster were agreed upon as being silver colored, about one inch thick and three inches in diameter. They were easily seen by the B-17 crewmen, gliding down slowly in a very uniform cluster."" ""And then the `impossible\' happened. B-17 Number 026 closed rapidly with a number of discs; the pilot attempted to evade an imminent collision with the objects, but was unsuccessful in his maneuver. He reported at the intelligence debriefing that his right wing ""went directly through a cluster with absolutely no effect on engines or plane surface."" ""The intelligence officers pressed their questioning, and the pilot stated further that one of the discs was heard to strike the tail assembly of his B-17, but that neither he nor any member of the crew heard or witnessed an explosion."" ""He further explained that about twenty feet from the discs the pilots sighted a mass of black debris of varying sizes of clusters of three by four feet."" ""The SECRET report added: `Also observed two other A/C flying through silver discs with no apparent damage. Observed discs and debris two other times but could not determine where it came from.\'"" ""No further information on this baffling incident has been uncovered, with the exception that such discs were observed by pilots and crew on missions prior to, and after, Mission 115 of October 14, 1943."" Caidin\'s account of the events of 14/10/43 has since been cited, quoted from and faithfully reproduced with not the slightest hint of analysis in over 20 UFO books. Tim Good\'s Above Top Secret uses the case to back up an as yet fictional WWII study of UFOs by one General Massey, and it is used both to support the \'UFOs were around in WWII\' school of thought but more so to hint at the birth of official cover-ups. Why? Well because in Caidin\'s book the account is footnoted ""1 Memorandum of October 24, 1943, from Major E.R.T. Holmes, F.L.O., 1st Bombardment Division, Reference FLO/IBW/REP/126, to M.I.15, War Office, Whitehall, London, SW (copy to Colonel E.W. Thomson, A-2, Pinetree)"", leaving us in no doubt that ""they"" knew all about this UFO sighting and had full documentation (at least two copies, not to mention any subsequent memoranda). But did they really? In fact, did the event ever really happen at all? I\'m not so sure it did. When I first discovered the account I began to see what could be found out about it -- it\'s obviously well-referenced and so should be easy to check out ... A letter to the M.O.D at their Air Historical Branch 5 came to nothing, suggesting that either of the documents may be held at the Public Records Office at Kew, London. A professional researcher was despatched to try to find the document. She searched all relevant Air Force records available (some are still bound by various `rules\' with embargos on viewing of up to 100 years) but could find nothing, despite the help of staff there and noting that ""the reference FLO etc. does not correspond with any references at the record office."" In the USA, Dennis Stacy (MUFON Journal editor) had taken an interest in the case and followed up several leads, aided by the Freedom of Information Act. Firstly the A.F. Historical Research centre at Maxwell AFB searched their 8th A.F. files but could come across no documentary record of the event (interestingly enough I tried the same source and whilst they gave me squadron histories of the 415th Night Fighter squadron and their documented foo-fighter sightings, they could provide nothing on the Schweinfurt raid -- odd if the Schweinfurt events were real). The National Archives (Washington) searched their files but drew a blank. A letter written to French researcher J. M. Bigorne from the National Archives stated ""A search in records of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS), European War, Target Damage File, 11a (2606), Schweinfurt, failed to disclose any documentation or information regarding little flying discs by B-17 pilots."" All this presents us with a quandary. If the Archives are quite free about some foo-fighter info why, if it exists at all, should they be that bothered about concealing the Schweinfurt material? So far three independent researchers over the past ten years have had the same answer -- none of the flight records for that day record the event in Caidin\'s book. As I have seen other pilots\' logs which mention unusual UFO-type sightings during missions it would be inconceivable for at least a few aircrew on that raid to have mentioned it even in passing - especially as in this case it was obviously something of an item at de-briefing. Letters in numerous aircrew magazines (UK & US) requesting info on the raid were placed and despite many replies no-one knew anything. Aviation writers Martin Middlebrook and Chaz Bowyer who have written many highly detailed books about the air war, and have interviewed thousands of aircrew, wrote to say they had never heard of the incident, despite having had foo-fighters mentioned to them in other contexts. If the account wasn\'t a hoax and the government archives (all of them) were either lying or hiding material pertaining to the event the only way of proving it seemed to be getting a fresh first-hand report of the incident. Dennis Stacy contacted the 384th Bombing Group survivors association and with no account of the UFO sighting forthcoming from them (even stranger - perhaps survivors associations are in on the cover-up too), was put onto General Theodore Ross Milton who led the raid that day and went in first with the 91st Group Formation. He wrote; ""I don\'t recall seeing black discs or hearing about any strange phenomena from any of my group,"" was his reply to the questions Stacy posed him. Are we really to believe that the guy who led the raid didn\'t hear anything about the phenomenon? Or is he part of the cover up too? Martin Caidin, originator of the rumour also presents problems. His book Black Thursday was first published in 1960 and yet quotes an alleged SECRET report. How did he get hold of it then and why has it not been seen since? As for Caidin himself, several people have tried to get in touch with him without success. Both myself and MUFON Journal editor Dennis Stacy have tried to track him down via his publishers and a UFO magazine he has written for, but to no avail. He last appeared in the dodgy US magazine UFO Universe where he was featured on the front page as having \'chased bogies at 20,000 feet,\' (an astonishing spectacle no doubt!), but whilst the article gave details of UFOs he\'d seen post-WWII, government film of UFOs, cover-ups, and you name it (along with mucho promotion for his many books, including UFO based novels) the Schweinfurt raid was never mentioned. Funny that, really. So unless and until Caidin himself comes out of the woodwork with the original document to which he refers, or until someone who was on the raid can verify the sighting, or until other evidence about the event comes out, the discs mentioned by Martin Caidin seem to be nothing but a rumour -- a rumour which like so many others has distorted UFO literature for many years. On a more hopeful note, if the sightings did take place the event still has no real place in ufology, especially in the way it has been used. Remember from the original account the objects were only one inch by three inches which is stretching the small alien interpretation somewhat. In an air war context I would suggest that anything which is small and metallic and in clusters is some kind of ""window"" or radar deflecting device, or some other war related artefact. Caidin\'s account also mentions that pilots saw ""a mass of black debris of varying sizes"" in conjunction with the discs, suggesting that they came from some explosive shell casing or damaged airplane. Note also that at least one plane was alleged to have flown through clusters of the discs ""with absolutely no effect,"" suggesting that, like radar deflecting strips and their ilk, there was very little weight or mass to them. All this is pure speculation however. Finally, whilst this case is often included in `foo-fighter\' round-ups it really has no business there, being atypical of the general `foo-fighter\' morphology and behaviour. You may think I\'ve been a bit pedantic here with this case but, it is very significant and the available facts need to be made known. If people are going to talk about sightings then let\'s at least be certain they happened. If `cover-ups\' are to be invoked, let\'s see some non-anecdotal evidence. As with the other foo-fighter cover-up case from Germany (Project Uranus -- a hoax generated by French ufologist Henry Durrant to see how far it would go -- it went all over the place!), the Caidin account has been repeated ad nauseum by UFO writers each trying to use the material for their own ends without looking into the source material -- crap researchers the lot of `em! If the document Caidin alludes to turns up -- fair enough, but until then the case which launched the WWII cover-up idea seems to be on very shaky ground indeed.source and references:http://www.project1947.com/articles/arwwr.htm', 'UFO Sightings over France, 1990Fair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

He shot a photo showing 10 objects in the sky while on a hike near Santa Isabel. The man claims his picture... is the best UFO photo ever taken.It was in the hills above Santa Isabel In July of 1990 that Mike Orrell snapped a photograph that changed his life forever.""The sun was setting to the west, at about 3:30 or 4 in the afternoon,"" he explained.Mike was hiking near the Inaja Memorial Picnic Grounds.""It was on this block that I set my Canon camera -- I put it on maximum zoom lens,"" he said.Mike snapped a single photo of the landscape. When he got the prints back, he noticed something strange.""Soon as I saw the four-by-six picture, I saw the dots.""Ten dots in the sky. But they were so small, it was hard to make them out.""Even at this distance I could not see the objects until the photograph was enlarged,"" Mike said.Mike had the photo blown up -- again and again -- until the small dots were clearly visible. There were nine objects on the left, and one on the right. They looked like they were flying, but they did not appear to have wings.""Unlike birds or planes that would have wings or appendages, these objects were uniform in density and size,"" Mike said.The objects were acorn shaped and triangular, and similar to other UFO photos taken around the world, that Mike has posted on his Web site.""I have labeled this the best UFO photo ever taken, and there are other people who believe it is because the pattern I found in one of the objects is duplicated in three other separate UFO photographs,"" he said.Could it be? Flying saucers over San Diego\'s East County?News 8 took Mike Orrell\'s original negative to the experts at Chrome Photo in Sorrento Mesa, and asked for their opinion.""They\'re irregularly shaped, though, sort of triangular,"" one staff member said.The Chrome Photo staff took a close look at the negative. They were able to rule out dust on the lens damage to the negative, or mechanical defects with the camera.""The negative itself was intact,"" staff member Dennis Reiter said. ""There was no damage, no machine type damage in the process.""Next, they put the negative through a high-resolution scanner, and blew it up on a computer screen. So, are they UFO\'s?""I would agree with him -- they are flying objects and they are unidentified,"" Reiter said.The objects were actually in the sky that day, but the experts could not say for sure what they were.""If you\'re asking me if they\'re alien space craft, there\'s absolutely no indication they are alien space craft,"" he added.If you\'re still skeptical about Mike Orrell and his UFO photo, his story doesn\'t end there.""I had no idea the day I was here, that right behind us is an alien rock face,"" he said.That\'s right. Two weeks after mike took his UFO photo, he returned to the same spot only to find a rock formation in the shape of an alien face 15 feet from the spot where he took his photo. Mike says he knows it\'s a natural rock formation, and not made by aliens. On the other hand... his relationship with that rock is a bit unsettling.Mike says he\'s never seen another UFO since his close encounter 16 years ago. But he\'s still waiting for that day when the UFOs will come again. Orrell also has discovered other rock formations in the shape of human faces. One on El Capitan Mountain near Lakeside, and in La Jolla Cove.']"

Nathan, a notorious UFO sceptic, stated that he could find no evidence of a fake.   Certainly, for many who have examined the three images, the first shot is the most impressive. In it, the orange glowing craft can be seen through the windshield of the car, and light from the object is reflected both off the car's bonnet and off the metal guard rail by the side of the road. These, in particular, are details that experts claim are extremely difficult to fake. VIDEO EVIDENCE Mexican UFOlogist Jaime maussan was so intrigued by Carlos Diaz's account of his experiences that he provided him with a video camera and asked him to see if he could record the UFO on tape when it next appeared. A few weeks later, Diaz awoke at 5 a.m. and grabbed his camera. he walked out and waited. Apparently, within minutes, the craft appeared and hovered over the house, where Diaz filmed it. When Maussan saw the remarkable footage, he asked Diaz if he could get even closer to the craft while filming. Two months later, Diaz was once again able to film the craft, which this time hovered directly above him, without moving. However it is Diaz's third attempt to capture the craft on video that is the most spectacular. In this footage, Diaz having mounted his camera on a tripod, walks to the bottom of a field waving a flash light. Responding to this, the craft suddenly materializes directly above Diaz's head and sends beams of light down towards him. Then, the unidentified object remains motionless for 30 seconds, before blinking out. It is universally recognized that this video contains some of the best UFO footage ever taken. source:This article originally appeared in issue 89 of The X Factor.

The UFO Casebook has a  transcription  of this taped session.                   Betty Cash, one of three people injured in a UFO close encounter                  near Huffman, Texas, on December 29, 1980, died on the 18th                  anniversary of the event, in Birmingham, Alabama. She had been in                  poor health ever since the encounter. At the time of the event, Mrs.                  Cash operated her own businesses near Dayton, Texas.                    Betty Cash, along with Vickie Landrum and grandson Colby                  Landrum, encountered a huge UFO accompanied by military                  helicopters on a dark road in the east Texas Piney Woods. They                  were exposed to radiation from the object, which caused extreme                  medical problems such as burns, eye damage, hair loss, diarrhea, and                  vomiting. Although they and others observed a large number of                  military helicopters along with the UFO, the U.S. Government                  refused to acknowledge the event or assist them in any way.                    After the encounter, Betty Cash was hospitalized and treated for                  burns and the other maladies. The extent of the injuries was so great,                  she was forced to close her businesses and never worked again. He                  life became a series of hospital stays, many of them in intensive care.                  Eventually, she developed cancer, which was successfully treated. In                  November 1998, Mrs. Cash suffered a stroke. On December 29,                  during her recovery, an unusual turn of events claimed her life.                    Mrs. Cash was a hero in the fight against government UFO                  cover-ups and brought hope to other victims of UFO incidents. She                  was devoted to family and friends and never allowed her illness to                  prevent her from helping others to cope with the trauma of UFO                  close encounters.                                Betty Cash will be missed... but never forgotten.                    Peter A. Gersten Director        In 1981 I represented three People in a lawsuit against the United                  States Government for injuries that resulted from their contact with                  an unusual aerial object. Betty Cash, Vicky Landrum and Colby                  Landrum are the only three People to ever sue our government for                  injuries from a UFO. On the eighteenth anniversary of her                  encounter, Betty Cash died.                    Betty Cash was a warrior and heroine.

V. Koepke, First Officer William B. Nash and Second Officer William H. Fortenberry.  The sun had set an hour before though the coastline was still visible, and the night was clear and almost entirely dark. With the aircraft set on automatic pilot, while cruising at 8000 feet over the Chesapeake Bay approaching Norfolk, Virginia, they were due to over fly the VRF radio range station in six minutes and make a position report.  In the mean time, since this was Fortenberry’s first run on this course, Nash, in the left pilot’s seat, was orientating Fortenberry by pointing out landmarks and the distant lights of the cities along the route.  Nash had just pointed out the city of Newport News and Cumberland, ahead and to the right of the plane, when unexpectedly a red-orange brilliance appeared near the ground, beyond and slightly east of Newport News. The brilliance seemed to have appeared all of a sudden and both pilots witnessed the startling appearance at practically the same moment. In the excitement someone blurted out, “What the hell is that?”  Captain Nash later described their initial observations…     “Almost immediately we perceived that it consisted of six bright objects streaking toward us at tremendous speed, and obviously well below us. They had the fiery aspect of hot coals, but of much greater glow, perhaps twenty times more brilliant than any of the scattered ground lights over which they passed or the city lights to the right. Their shape was clearly outlined and evidently circular; the edges were well defined, not phosphorescent or fuzzy in the least and the red-orange color was uniform over the upper surface of each craft.”  “Within the few seconds that it took the six objects to come half the distance from where we had first seen them, we could observe that they were holding a narrow echelon formation, a stepped-up line tilted slightly to our right with the leader at the lowest point, and each following craft slightly higher.  At about the halfway point, the leader appeared to attempt a sudden slowing. We received this impression because the second and third wavered slightly and seemed almost to overrun the leader, so that for a brief moment during the remainder of their approach the positions of these three varied.  It looked very much as if an element of ""human"" or ""intelligence"" error had been introduced, in so far as the following two did not react soon enough when the leader began to slow down and so almost overran him.” What occurred next utterly astonished the pilots. The procession shot forward like a stream of tracer bullets, out over the Chesapeake Bay to within a half-mile of the plane. Realizing that the line was going to pass under the nose of the plane and to the right of the copilot, Nash quickly unfastened his seat belt so that he could move to the window on that side. During this interval, Nash briefly lost sight of the objects, though Fortenberry kept them in view below the plane and both would later recollect…        “All together, they flipped on edge, the sides to the left going up and the glowing surface facing right. Though the bottom surfaces did not become clearly visible, we had the impression that they were unlighted. The exposed edges, also unlighted, appeared to be about 15 feet thick, and the top surface, at least, seemed flat.  In shape and proportion, they were much like coins. While all were in the edgewise position, the last five slid over and past the leader so that the echelon was now tail-foremost, so to speak, the top or last craft now being nearest to our position.” This shift had taken only a brief second and was completed by the time Nash reached the window.  Both pilots then observed the discs flip back from on-edge to the flat position and the entire line dart off to the West in a direction that formed a sharp angle with their initial course, holding the new formation.  The pilots had noticed that the objects seemed to dim slightly just prior to the abrupt angular turn and had brightened considerably after making it. Attempting to describe the objects extreme actions, Nash proposed, “The only descriptive comparison we can offer is a ball ricocheting off a wall.”  An instant later, two more identical objects darted out past the right wing, from behind and under the airplane at the same altitude as the others and quickly fell in behind the receding procession. They observed that these two seemed to glow considerably brighter than the others, as though applying power to catch up.  As they stared after them dumbfounded, suddenly the lights of all of the objects blinked out, only to reappear a moment later, maintaining low altitude out across the blackness of the bay, until about 10 miles beyond Newport News when they began climbing in a graceful arc that carried them well above the plane’s altitude. Sweeping upward they randomly blinked out and finally vanished in the dark night sky. Describing the disappearance of the objects some years later, Nash wrote,        “As they climbed, they oscillated up and down behind one another in a irregular fashion, as though they were extremely sensitive to control. In doing this, they went vertically past one another, bobbing up and down, (just as the front three went horizontally past one another, as the initial six approached us. This appeared to be an intelligence error, ‘lousing up the formation’)—they disappeared by blinking out in a mixed-up fashion, in no particular order.”  Their bewildered initial reaction is best affirmed in the words of Nash…      “We stared after them, dumbfounded and probably open-mouthed. We looked around at the sky, half expecting something else to appear, though nothing did. There were flying saucers, and we had seen them. What we had witnessed was so stunning and incredible that we could readily believe that if either of us had seen it alone, he would have hesitated to report it. But here we were, face to face. We couldn\'t both be mistaken about such a striking spectacle.”     At ""A"", during approach, six UFOs held a stepped-up echelon formation. Flipping on edge at ""B"", folloers overrode the leader until, in reverse order at the V-point, they flipped flat again and the echelon darted in a new direction, appearing aligned from the the observers\' point of view. At ""C"", after a brief blink-out, the six were joined by two from behind the airliner. The time was 8:12 Eastern Standard Time. As the reality of their experience dawned on them the first question which came to mind was whether anybody else onboard had seen the spectacle. Fortenberry went through the small forward passenger compartment, where the captain was intent on paper work. In the main cabin a cautious inquiry whether anyone had seen anything unusual produced no results.   Back in the cockpit, the pilots radioed Norfolk and gave their position according to schedule, and upon receiving confirmation added a second message to be forwarded to the military: ""Two pilots of this flight observed eight unidentified objects vicinity Langley Field; estimate speed in excess of 1,000 mph; altitude estimated 2,000 feet."" At this point, Captain Koepke came forward and took over control of the DC-4 while Nash and Fortenberry went to work reconstructing the sighting.  With a Dalton Mark 7 computer they determined the objects\' angle of approach and the same for the angle of departure. The difference between the two was about 30 degrees; therefore, the objects had made a 150-degree change of course almost instantaneously.  They were able to accurately determine their position visually and by reference to their position to the VHF range at Norfolk.  The objects first appeared beyond and to the east of Newport News and came toward the DC-4 in a straight line, changed direction beneath the plane and departed in a straight line to the West once again passing a suburban edge of Newport News and seemed to travel out over a dark area before they began to climb steeply into the night sky.  They determined that Newport News was 25 miles away and added the additional 10 and 30 miles that they estimated the objects had traveled in each direction, arriving at a total distance of 90 miles. To be conservative they decided to use 50 miles, since they had seen them travel at least that distance.  Determining the time duration of the sighting was not so straightforward.  Wanting to be accurate, they reenacted the exact sequence of events seven times, and using the panel stopwatch clocks determined that the time period did not exceed 12 seconds each time. Again, to be conservative they adopted 15 seconds in the final computation, which meant that the objects were flying at the rate of 200 miles per minute, or 12,000 miles per hour!  They estimated that the objects were slightly more than a mile below the plane, or about 2000 feet above ground level, and by mentally comparing their appearance with the wingspread of a DC-3 at that distance, judged the size to be approximately 100 feet diameter and 15 feet thick.   Determinations of distance, size and speed are always open to question by the fact that the objects observed were unidentified phenomena. However, this particular incident was especially unique in the sense that the pilots observed the objects between the ground and the plane.   Most sightings occur against an empty sky without any standard of comparison to known objects or distance, but in this case the planes altitude of 8000 feet established a finite distance for reference. Nash later qualified his ability to estimate the altitude of the objects in a letter to astrophysicist, Dr. Donald H. Menzel.        “We both had flown many thousands of hours at either 7000 or 8000 feet, because these altitudes were high enough to avoid most turbulence but not so high as to starve us for oxygen. Hence, a sort-of “instinct-judgment” about the height of objects gradually developed.  If after 10,000 hours of flying at the same altitude a pilot cannot judge if something (even an unfamiliar something) is halfway between his plane and the ground, and split that in half again, he best quit. Our judgment, after seeing these things travel nearly a hundred miles, and observing them both from a distance and almost directly beneath us, was that they were holding 2000 feet for most of the observed time.” Further, both Nash and Fortenberry had served in the Navy during the war in which Nash flew patrol bombers for the Naval Air Transport Service patrolling between the African and South American coastlines in search of German submarines. Fortenberry served in the U.S. Navy Air experimental wing for two years and was well aware of aeronautical developments for the time. In naval training, both pilots had received intensive instruction in aircraft identification and had learned to identify every ship in the German Navy.  While Nash and Fortenberry were still discussing the matter, the lights of a northbound airliner came into view on a course about 1,000 feet above. Ordinarily the head-on approach of two airliners at 500 mph seems fairly rapid. But in this instance, compared to the streaking speed of the discs, the oncoming plane seemed to be standing still. If any normal happening could have increased the effect of the night\'s experience, it was just such a commonplace event.  They landed at Miami International Airport shortly after midnight. Upon entering the operations office, they found a copy of the message they had transmitted to the military through Norfolk, with an addition: ""Advise crew five jets were in area at the time."" This didn\'t exactly apply since the things they had seen were eight in number, and they were dead sure they were not jets.  At 7 A.M. Air Force investigators telephoned and an appointment was set for an interview later that morning. USAF Wing Intelligence officer Major John H. Sharpe and four officers from the 7th District Office of Special Investigations met Nash and Fortenberry at the airport. In separate rooms, the pilots were questioned for one hour and forty-five minutes and following that, for a half-hour together.  The pilots were duly impressed by the skill and thoroughness of their interrogators. Questions had been prepared in advance and posed individually to the two pilots in order to evaluate their recall. Map overlays were compared and they had a complete weather report for the area, which coincided with the previous night’s flight plan.  It stated; 3/8 Cirrus clouds about 20,000 feet. No inversion and a sharply clear night, probably unstable air. Visibility was unusually good. Following the interview, the investigators advised the pilots that they had already received seven additional reports from persons who had witnessed similar incidents within 30 minutes, in the same area.  The best was from a Lt. Commander and his wife who described a formation of red discs traveling at high-speed and making immediate directional changes without a turning radius. Being told that their particular experience was by no means unique surprised the pilots.  None of these reports appear in the official Blue Book files, though three reports requested by ATIC in August describe multiple objects cavorting over Washington D.C. at 9:00 A.M., the morning of the sighting. Fortunately, NICAP retained copies of some of the confirmatory reports for the evening of July 14, which were published in the Norfolk newspapers.  Although none of the reported sightings appear to describe the identical maneuvers that the pilots witnessed, a couple are sufficiently similar to be taken as reasonable substantiations. For example, one witness stated that,        “She and a friend were sitting on a bench in Stockley Gardens when they saw what appeared to be flying saucers ‘circling overhead and then going north.’ She said they saw seven or eight altogether ‘the first three white and the others were yellow and red.’” In a letter to the editor of the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot, the naval officer from the cruiser Roanoke, apparently mentioned to Nash and Fortenberry during the OSI investigation, reported that he had sighted eight red lights in the direction of Point Comfort that proceeded in a straight line and then disappeared. He saw the objects at about 8:55 P.M. Eastern Daylight-Saving Time, approximately 15 minutes before the pilot’s sighting, as he was driving towards the Naval base for a 9:00 P.M. appointment.  Especially interesting is that as a result of the press coverage of the Pan American pilots sighting the following day, Paul R. Hill, an aerodynamicist at the NASA-Langley facility, decided to watch the sky for UFOs on the evening of July 16. Expecting “conformance to pattern” he parked at the waterfront a little before 8:00 P.M. and soon observed two amber-colored objects approach from the South and turn West taking them directly overhead.  At this point, the objects curiously appeared to be alternatively jumping forward of each other slightly.  Then after passing zenith, they made an astounding maneuver. They began to revolve around a common center, and after a few revolutions, switched to the vertical plane! Within a few more seconds two more similar objects joined the first two before all four headed south. Hill later wrote,        “Up to that point I had been just a fascinated spectator. Now they had convinced me. At that moment, I realized that here were visitors from another world. There is a lot of truth in the old saying, ‘It’s different when it happens to you.’ It was within my line of business to know that no Earthcraft could remotely approach those maneuvers.” This sighting prompted Paul Hill to a life-long study collecting and analyzing sightings’ reports for physical properties and propulsion possibilities in an attempt to make technological sense of the unconventional objects. The study was eventually published posthumously, under the title, Unconventional Flying Objects: A Scientific Analysis (Hampton Roads, 1995), in which Hill presents his thesis that UFOs “obey, not defy, the laws of physics.”  At the time of these sightings flying saucers had been big news for many weeks and the staff of nine at Project Blue Book were swamped with sighting reports, far more than they could properly deal with. By mid-July they were getting about twenty reports a day and frantic calls from intelligence officers at every Air Force base in the U.S.  The reports they were getting were good ones and could not be easily explained. In fact, the unexplained sightings were running at about 40 percent. All this was leading inexorably to the following weekend when UFOs were picked up by radar at Washington National Airport in restricted air space over the nation’s capitol, and would become one of the most highly publicized sightings of UFO history.  For those reasons, the Nash/Fortenberry sighting received a less than adequate investigation.  Project Blue Book quickly determined that the five jets flying out of Langley, AFB could not have possibly been responsible for the sighting, and the case was dropped and filed as an “Unknown.”  It was not until 1962 that the case would be reexamined by the Director of the Harvard College Observatory, astrophysicist Donald H. Menzel, and published in his book, The World of Flying Saucers: A Scientific Examination of a Major Myth of the Space Age (Doubleday, 1963).    At the time, Professor Charles A. Maney, a physicist at Defiance College, had been engaged in a rather lengthy correspondence with Menzel, and when the Nash/Fortenberry sighting came up, Maney forwarded copies of the correspondence to Nash, then an advisor to NICAP.  This led to a series of lengthy correspondences over a six-month period between Nash and Menzel providing considerable insight into the process by which Menzel arrived at his eventual solution to the inexplicable sighting.  Based on the meager data contained in the official report, Menzel assumed that the sighting could be reasonably explained as a reflection in the cockpit windows, especially considering the nearly instantaneous reversal, which seems to defy the laws of physics pertaining to inertia. In support of this explanation he underscored the apparent failure of the crew and Air Force investigators to make any tests for possible reflections, and generally called into question the credibility of the pilots. In a fairly scathing letter, Nash remonstrated Menzel on this critical point:   “Dr. Menzel, regardless of your figures the western horizon was not quite bright, and regarding your “reflection theory,” in the first place the objects were between us and the West. In the second place, they would have had to be damned persistent, consistent and impossible reflections to have manifested in three cockpit windows in exactly the same way. We first observed them through the front window. As they approached and I moved across the cockpit, I kept my eyes on the objects and saw them through the curved window of the windshield, and we both finished our observations looking through the right side window. That is why there is no evidence (as you complain to Dr. Maney) that the pilots considered that what they saw was a reflection; and you state that we were too excited by what we saw to make the most elementary scientific tests. Again, Doctor, pilots do not excite easily or they would not be airline pilots—please—a little respect for us?” Dr. Menzel’s next line of inquiry concerned whether the reflection could have been caused by an illumination within the cockpit, or possibly a “hostess taking a drag of a cigarette.” Dr. Maney’s rather sardonic response to this possibility was, “Quite a long drag, wouldn’t you say?” But, nevertheless, the pilots weren’t smoking, the cockpit door was closed, there were no hostesses on the flight and the pilot’s observed the object’s reversal out of the right window below the plane.  This pretty well convinced Menzel that an internal reflection was unlikely to explain the phenomenon and what Captain Nash had seen was something outside the plane.  Still, Menzel concluded that Nash’s observations “… are completely consistent with the theory that the discs were immaterial images made of light.”  Therefore, to explain the sighting he theorized that,     “…a temperature inversion can lead to a sharp concentration of haze, ice crystals, smoke or other particles in a relatively thin layer.  The layer is often invisible until the plane actually goes through it, when it appears as a thin, bright, hazy line that disappears a moment later when the plane breaks through it. Multiple layers of such haze are not unknown, stacked one on top of the other. Now, a sharply focused searchlight, shining at night through a series of such hazy layers, will show up as a series of discs. As the searchlight moves, the discs will appear to spread out, exhibit perspective, and, as the searchlight turns around, the discs will appear to ricochet.” The soundness of his theory depended on the prevailing weather conditions. Since the official weather reports for that evening indicated that there were no temperature inversions present, Dr. Menzel carefully constructed a scenario in which inversions (albeit in meteorological parlance, a sub refractive condition) could have been present though undetectable by the weather service.      “In the summer of 1952 all the eastern states were suffering from a intense heat wave and drought, and the ground cooled rapidly after sunset, because of the lack of cloud cover during the day. In a period of heat and drought, the nightly cooling produces marked inversions favorable to extreme refraction and reflection. Small in extent, existing only briefly in one place, constantly changing location, such inversions may not be detectable by radiosonde observations.” Dr. Menzel admitted that his solution does not identify the particular beacon or searchlight responsible for the sightings, though he suggests that, “A light on the Virginia coast, shining northeast toward the plane, could easily have been spread out into a series of images like those observed.” Apparently, the location of the light is assumed to be at the point of the pilot’s initial sighting of the red-glow, beyond and to the East of Newport News.  This begs the question why experienced pilots could not identify an apparently fixed high-intensity (red!) light source if it were emanating from a position 25 miles in front and below and directed toward their aircraft. Since the discs were organized in a stepped-up echelon, with the leading disc at the lowest point, one would deduce that the source of the light must have been from behind the aircraft. Had the light source been in front of the aircraft, as Dr. Menzel postulates, the leading disc would have appeared in the highest position in the echelon. Further, a searchlight reflecting off a horizontal cloud layer at an oblique angle to the observer would produce a gradual elongation of the disc as it moves relative to the observer. Nor does the theory account for the two discs that darted out from under the plane and conjoined the original six before disappearing into the night sky. Or the mechanism that would need to be in effect to make the discs appear to flip vertically on edge, reverse position in formation while maintaining relative distances, and then flip back to the horizontal plane (while executing a 150-degree course change at, well, in the words of investigating officer, Major John Sharpe, “…a speed fantastic to contemplate.” Incidentally, 90 miles in 12 seconds equals 27,000 mph!)  In his book, Dr. Menzel asserts that his solution offers, “a highly probable explanation that is consistent with all observations and does not depend on the presence of an extraterrestrial spacecraft.” I have to agree with the later part of the statement, but have no doubt that readers will find further inconsistencies in Dr. Menzel’s impracticable solution.  Some years later, in early 1957, Bill Fortenberry was lost in a Boeing B-377 Stratocruiser crash in the Pacific Ocean, with all onboard. In the early sixties, Captain Nash transferred to Germany, and for the next 15 years flew the Berlin corridors before retiring from Pan American. In a recent interview for the Sign Oral History Project, a still vivacious Captain Nash provided their concluding supposition…   “Looking at the thing shook us up. We stared at each other, and all of a sudden there was this realization that our world is not alone in the universe. Because, nothing could have advanced to that degree of scientific progress without some of the intermediate steps having become public knowledge, or, at least known to the people who were flying. Bill had just come out of the Navy and was fully acquainted with their latest developments. We just knew that they were not from this planet. I know to this day, that it was nothing from this planet.” written by: Tom Tulien References:  Nash, William B. and Fortenberry, William H. “We Flew Above Flying Saucers.” True Magazine, October 1952: p. 65, 110-112.

A Sci-fi movie scenario? well, not really. The following account still stands as one of the best ""physical trace"" cases in UFO lore. The United States Air Force certainly took it seriously, and so should we. Scoutmaster, D.S. “Sonny” DesVergers of West Palm Beach, Florida was driving three scouts home on the night in question. He turned off the coastal highway and down an inland blacktop to go where one of the boys lived. After traveling about ten miles inland he noticed a bright light in the palmetto thickets. At first he passed by it, but then stopped down the road and turned the car around to go back. He hesitated in doing this, but could not help feeling that the light might have been a fire, perhaps indicating a crashed airplane. DesVergers stopped the car, and got out to proceed to the scene of the bright lights. The scouts objected, afraid to be alone in the darkness, but the Scoutmaster headed toward the thick brush not far from the road. Nearby were the swamps, full of snakes, alligators, and who knows what other deadly creatures. About 50 yards or so from the road, Des Verges disappeared into the waist-high thicket. As he did, the first thing he noticed was a terrible odor.Using his machete to clear his way with one hand, his other held his flashlight to show the way through the darkness. He carried a second flashlight on his person. The boys, waiting in the car, could clearly see the beam of their Scoutmaster\'s flashlight through the brush. Knowing he was being tracked by his flashlight, he shined it up into the canopy of some of the trees as he proceeded toward the unknown source of the lights that had caused him to stop on the road. As he reached an opening in the brush, he paused momentarily to signal back to the waiting boys. As he did, he was suddenly overcome by an intensely humid heat. He glanced up into the clear night sky to get his bearings, but to his surprise, the many stars he had seen only a few moments ago were gone directly above him. Something else was blocking the view. It took a moment for his eyes to adjust to a large, oval object which was hovering about 30 feet above him. As he slowly moved away from the frightening sight, he shined his flashlight toward the object. He could now make out the concave bottom of a smooth, round craft with a dome on top. He continued to slowly move back from the object until he heard a sound which froze him in his tracks. The sound he heard was a large metal door closing. He now found himself surrounded by a red mist. He then lost consciousness.The three boys, Bobby Ruffing, Chuck Stevens, and David Rowan could see their role model surround by what they could best describe as a ""big red ball of fire."" Frightened, they left the car, and ran as fast as they could down the road to a house. Finding a farmer, they told him what they had seen. The farmer quickly called the State Police who soon arrived at the scene. Deputy sheriff Mott Partin picked the boys up and drove back to the car. As they arrived, they saw DesVergers racing from the wooded area. Partin said that DesVergers was more scared than anyone he had ever seen. The other officers who accompanied Partin ran into the area vacated by the frightened Scoutmaster, finding one of his flashlights still burning. They also noticed that the grass was flattened near the flashlight. The master\'s second flashlight would never be found.  Arriving at Police headquarters, the officers noticed that DesVergers\' hands, arms, face, and cap were all burned. Although the officers were doubtful of the red mist account, they believed the rest of the Scoutmaster\'s account enough to call the Air Force.Edward J Ruppelt was heading the Air Force\'s Project Bluebook at the time, and was impressed enough to take an investigative group to Florida to question DesVerges. He was accompanied by Second Lietenant Robert M. Olsson, and two captains, Hoey and Davis. Ruppelt would interview DesVergers several times, and remarked that the Scoutmaster remembered details very well, and did not respond in a rehearsed manner. He felt that DesVergers was telling the truth.An Air Force surgeon did an examination on DesVergers and determined that his wounds were indicative of mild sunburn. There were singed hairs, burns on his face and arms, and also his nostrils showed signs of being burned by a ""flash heat source.""At the scene of the event, Ruppelt could find nothing to invalidate the Scoutmaster\'s account. Although there were no apparent signs of scorched earth or grass, later it was revealed after tests at Dayton, Ohio that the roots of the samples of grass taken at the scene were charred. Also, DesVergers\' cap showed signs of being damaged by ""sparks of some kind.""The three boys confirmed that the cap had not been burned earlier in the day.

A Sci-fi movie scenario? well, not really. The following account still stands as one of the best ""physical trace"" cases in UFO lore. The United States Air Force certainly took it seriously, and so should we. Scoutmaster, D.S. “Sonny” DesVergers of West Palm Beach, Florida was driving three scouts home on the night in question. He turned off the coastal highway and down an inland blacktop to go where one of the boys lived. After traveling about ten miles inland he noticed a bright light in the palmetto thickets. At first he passed by it, but then stopped down the road and turned the car around to go back. He hesitated in doing this, but could not help feeling that the light might have been a fire, perhaps indicating a crashed airplane. DesVergers stopped the car, and got out to proceed to the scene of the bright lights. The scouts objected, afraid to be alone in the darkness, but the Scoutmaster headed toward the thick brush not far from the road. Nearby were the swamps, full of snakes, alligators, and who knows what other deadly creatures. About 50 yards or so from the road, Des Verges disappeared into the waist-high thicket. As he did, the first thing he noticed was a terrible odor.Using his machete to clear his way with one hand, his other held his flashlight to show the way through the darkness. He carried a second flashlight on his person. The boys, waiting in the car, could clearly see the beam of their Scoutmaster\'s flashlight through the brush. Knowing he was being tracked by his flashlight, he shined it up into the canopy of some of the trees as he proceeded toward the unknown source of the lights that had caused him to stop on the road. As he reached an opening in the brush, he paused momentarily to signal back to the waiting boys. As he did, he was suddenly overcome by an intensely humid heat. He glanced up into the clear night sky to get his bearings, but to his surprise, the many stars he had seen only a few moments ago were gone directly above him. Something else was blocking the view. It took a moment for his eyes to adjust to a large, oval object which was hovering about 30 feet above him. As he slowly moved away from the frightening sight, he shined his flashlight toward the object. He could now make out the concave bottom of a smooth, round craft with a dome on top. He continued to slowly move back from the object until he heard a sound which froze him in his tracks. The sound he heard was a large metal door closing. He now found himself surrounded by a red mist. He then lost consciousness.The three boys, Bobby Ruffing, Chuck Stevens, and David Rowan could see their role model surround by what they could best describe as a ""big red ball of fire."" Frightened, they left the car, and ran as fast as they could down the road to a house. Finding a farmer, they told him what they had seen. The farmer quickly called the State Police who soon arrived at the scene. Deputy sheriff Mott Partin picked the boys up and drove back to the car. As they arrived, they saw DesVergers racing from the wooded area. Partin said that DesVergers was more scared than anyone he had ever seen. The other officers who accompanied Partin ran into the area vacated by the frightened Scoutmaster, finding one of his flashlights still burning. They also noticed that the grass was flattened near the flashlight. The master\'s second flashlight would never be found.  Arriving at Police headquarters, the officers noticed that DesVergers\' hands, arms, face, and cap were all burned. Although the officers were doubtful of the red mist account, they believed the rest of the Scoutmaster\'s account enough to call the Air Force.Edward J Ruppelt was heading the Air Force\'s Project Bluebook at the time, and was impressed enough to take an investigative group to Florida to question DesVerges. He was accompanied by Second Lietenant Robert M. Olsson, and two captains, Hoey and Davis. Ruppelt would interview DesVergers several times, and remarked that the Scoutmaster remembered details very well, and did not respond in a rehearsed manner. He felt that DesVergers was telling the truth.An Air Force surgeon did an examination on DesVergers and determined that his wounds were indicative of mild sunburn. There were singed hairs, burns on his face and arms, and also his nostrils showed signs of being burned by a ""flash heat source.""At the scene of the event, Ruppelt could find nothing to invalidate the Scoutmaster\'s account. Although there were no apparent signs of scorched earth or grass, later it was revealed after tests at Dayton, Ohio that the roots of the samples of grass taken at the scene were charred. Also, DesVergers\' cap showed signs of being damaged by ""sparks of some kind.""The three boys confirmed that the cap had not been burned earlier in the day.

DesVergers\' story stands today as a documented physical trace account of a UFO encounter.B J Booth', '1952 Washington D.C. SightingsDuring the dawn of Ufology in the United States, unidentified flying objects made themselves known to the leaders of the free world in 1952, buzzing over the White House, the Capitol building, and the Pentagon. Seemingly the unknown objects were defying the very governmental agencies sworn to protect the United States from foreign powers. Washington National Airport and Andrews Air Force Base picked up a number of UFOs on their radar screens on July 19, 1952, beginning a wave of sightings still unexplained to this day. These blips were objects traveling at about 100 M.P.H. but with the ability to accelerate to the unbelievable speed of 7,200 M.P.H. The Washington National sighting was confirmed by other local radar, and then Andrews Air Force Base was contacted. Washington Tower:Andrews Tower, do you read? Did you have an airplane in sight west-northwest or east of your airport moving east-bound? Andrews: No, but we just got a call from the center. We\'re looking for it. Washington: We\'ve got a big target showing up on our scope. He\'s just coming in on the west edge of your airport-the northwest edge of it eastbound. He\'ll be passing right through the northern portion of your field on an east heading. He\'s about a quarter of a mile from the northwest runway-right over the edge of your northwest runway now. Andrews: What happened to your target now? Washington: He\'s still eastbound. He went directly over Andrews Fields and is now five miles east. Andrews: Where did he come from? Washington: We picked him up ourselves at about seven miles east, slightly southeast, and we have been tracking him ever since then. The Center has been tracking him farther than that. Andrews: Was he waving his course? Washington: Holding steady course, due east heading. Andrews: This is Andrews. Our radar tracking says he\'s got a big fat target out here northeast of Andrews. He says he\'s got two more south of the field. Washington: Yes, well the center has about four or five around the Andrews Range station. The Center is working a National Airlines - the center is working him and vectoring him around his target. He went around Andrews. He saw one of them - looks like a meteor. (Garbled)… Went by him… or something. He said he\'s got one about three miles off his right wing right now. There are so many targets around here it is hard to tell as they are not moving very fast. Andrews: What about his altitude? Washington: Well, must be over 8,000 feet as we don\'t have him in radar any more. Andrews Air Force Base notified the U.S. Air Force Air Defense Command. A couple of F-94 night fighters were ordered to the skies, but runway repairs held their mission up for several hours. By the time they were airborne, the mysterious objects were gone. The fighters returned home, but soon the objects again showed up on the radar screens. For the next several hours, the fighters chased the illusive targets, but to no avail. They were able to sight the UFOs, but lights of the unknown objects would darken as they were approached. Constant communication was kept with ground radar, and as the pilots lost sight of the UFOs, they also disappeared from ground radar. The UFOs were also separately witnessed by the crew of a B-29, and other commercial flights. After a quiet week, the objects reappeared on July 26. After multiple radar operators confirmed the objects, the F-94s again began their search for the enigmatic lights over Washington. The results of their pursuit were identical to the week before. They could see the lights, but when they drew near, the lights would blackout. After their fruitless journey, the planes returned home, only to hear that the objects again were being tracked by radar. One of the pilots stated his fear and frustration by air to ground radio. ""They\'ve surrounded my plane, what should I do?"" The phenomenal sights would bring about an Air Force press conference on July 29, with Major General John A. Samford in charge. The official explanation was ""temperature inversions,"" which supposedly caused ground lights to bounce off of clouds, giving the appearance of lighted craft in the skies. The naive and trusting press accepted this explanation at first, in lieu of any other ""reasonable"" one. This explanation was scoffed at, however, by Ufologists, knowing that it just did not explain what was seen by pilots and radar operators. Even Project Bluebook would also dismiss the ""temperature inversion"" explanation, as it later labeled the Washington sightings as ""unknown."" The radar operators offered their own reason for the rejecting the Air Force explanation. Radar controller Barnes would state, ""Inversion blips are always recognized by experts, we are familiar with what weather conditions, flying birds, and [other] such things can cause on radar. Temperature inversions on radar are typically weak returns and move at a slow ground speed. These blips were distinctly clear, reported as a very good return, solid and often traveled at unbelievable speeds.""The Washington D. C. sightings are a solid case of UFO activity. Literally hundreds of eyewitnesses saw the objects, and photographed them. Many of these were Air Force personnel, considered as reliable. Many of them made comment of the sightings, one was a Sergeant Harrison: ""I saw the ... light moving from the Northeast toward the range station. These lights did not have the characteristics of shooting stars. There were no trails and seemed to go out rather than disappear, and traveled faster than any shooting star I have ever seen."" The sightings continued throughout the month of July. (B J Booth)See transcript of article belowJuly 28, 1952 ""Saucer"" outran jet, pilot revealsInvestigation on in secret after chase over capital Radar spot blips like aircraft for nearly six hours - only 1,700 feet upBy Paul Sampson, Post Reporter Military secrecy veils an investigation of the mysterious, glowing aerial objects that showed up on radar screens in the Washington area Saturday night for the second consecutive week. A jet pilot sent up by the Air Defense Command to investigate the objects reported he was unable to overtake the glowing lights moving near Andrews Air Force Base. The CAA reported the objects traveled at ""predominantly lower levels"" - about 1700 feet. July 19. Air Force spokesmen said yesterday only that an investigation was being made into the sighting of the objects on the radar screen in the CAA Air Route Traffic Control Center at Washington National Airport, and on two other radar screens . Methods of the investigations were classified as secret, a spoken said. ""We have no evidence they are flying saucers; conversely we have no evidence they are not flying saucers. We don\'t know what they are,"" a spokesman added. The same source reported an expert from the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton Ohio, was here last week investigating the objects sighted July 19. The expert has been identified as Capt. E. J. Ruppelt. Reached by telephone at his home in Dayton yesterday, Ruppelt said he could make no comment on his activity in Washington. Capt. Ruppelt confirmed he was in Washington last week but said he had not come here to investigate the mysterious objects. He recalled he did make an investigation after hearing of the objects, but could not say what he investigated. Another Air Force spokesman said here yesterday the Air Force is taking all steps necessary to evaluate the sightings. ""The intelligence people,"" this spokesman explained, ""sent someone over to the control center at the time of the sightings and did whatever necessary to make the proper evaluation. Asked whether the radar equipment might have been malfunctioning, the spokesman said, ""radar, like the compass is not a perfect instrument and is subject to error."" He thought, however, the investigation would be made by persons acquainted with the problems of radar. Two other radar screens in the area picked up the objects. An employee of the National Airport control tower said the radar scope there picked up very weak ""blips"" of the objects. The tower radar\'s for ""short range"" and is not as powerful as that at the center. Radar at Andrews Air Force Base also registered the objects from about seven miles south of the base. A traffic control center spokesman said the nature of the signals on the radar screen ruled out any possibility they were from clouds or any other ""weather"" disturbance. ""The returns we received from the unidentified objects were similar and analogous to targets representing aircraft in flight,"" he said. The objects, ""flying saucer or what have you, appeared on the radar scope at the airport center at 9:08 PM. Varying from 4 to 12 in number, the objects appeared on the screen until 3:00 AM., when they disappeared. At 11:25 PM., two F-94 jet fighters from Air Defense Command squadron, at New Castle Delaware, capable of 600 hundred mph speeds, took off to investigate the objects. Airline, civil and military pilots described the objects as looking like the lit end of a cigarette or a cluster of orange and red lights. One jet pilot observed 4 lights in the vicinity of Andrews Air Force Base, but was not able to over-take them, and they disappeared in about two minutes. The same pilot observed a steady white light in the vicinity of Mt Vernon at 11:49 PM. The light, about 5 miles from him, faded in a minute. The lights were also observed in the Beltsville, MD., vicinity. At 1:40 AM two-other F-94 jet fighters took off and scanned the area until 2:20 AM., but did not make any sightings. Visible two daysAlthough ""unidentified objects"" have been picked up on radar before, the incidents of the last two Saturdays are believed to be the first time the objects have been picked up on radar-while visible to the human eye. Besides the pilots, who last Saturday saw the lights, a woman living on Mississippi Ave., told the Post she saw a very ""bright light streaking across the sky towards Andrews Air Force Base about 11:45 PM. Then a second object with a tail like a comet whizzed by, and a few seconds later, a third passed in a different direction toward Suntland, she said. Radar operators plotted the speed of ""Saturday night\'s visitors"" at from 38 to 90 mph, but one jet pilot reported faster speeds for the light he saw. The jet pilot reported he had no apparent ""closing speed"" when he attempted to reach the lights he saw near Andrews Air Force Base. That means the lights were moving at least as fast as his top speed-a maximum of 600 mph. One person who saw the lights when they first appeared in this area did not see them last night. He is E.W. Chambers, an engineer at Radio Station WRC, who spotted the lights while working early the morning of July 20 at station\'s Hyattsville tower.Chambers said he was sorry he had seen the lights because he had been skeptical about ""flying saucers"" before. Now he said, he sort of ""wonders"" and worries about the whole thing. Leon Davidson, 804 South Irving St. Arlington, a chemical engineer who made an exhaustive study of ""flying saucers"" as a hobby, said yesterday reports of saucers in the East, have been relatively rare. Davidson has studied the official report on the saucers, including some of the secret portions never made public, and analyzed all the data in the report. Davidson, whose study of saucers is impressively detailed and scientific, said he believes the lights are American ""aviation products"" - probably ""circular flying wings,"" using new type jet engines that permit rapid acceleration and relatively low speeds. He believes they are either ""new fighter,"" guided missiles or piloted guided missiles. He cited some of the recent jet fighters, including the Navy\'s new ""F-4-D, which has a radical ""bat-wing,"" as examples of what the objects might resemble. Davidson thinks the fact that the lights have been seen in this area indicates the authorities may be ready to disclose the ""new aircraft"" in the near future. Previously, most of the ""verified saucers"" have been seen over sparsely inhabited areas, Davidson explained, and now, when they appear here, it may indicate that ""secrecy"" is not so important any more.', '1952 Washington D.C.

The fighters returned home, but soon the objects again showed up on the radar screens. For the next several hours, the fighters chased the illusive targets, but to no avail. They were able to sight the UFOs, but lights of the unknown objects would darken as they were approached. Constant communication was kept with ground radar, and as the pilots lost sight of the UFOs, they also disappeared from ground radar. The UFOs were also separately witnessed by the crew of a B-29, and other commercial flights. After a quiet week, the objects reappeared on July 26. After multiple radar operators confirmed the objects, the F-94s again began their search for the enigmatic lights over Washington. The results of their pursuit were identical to the week before. They could see the lights, but when they drew near, the lights would blackout. After their fruitless journey, the planes returned home, only to hear that the objects again were being tracked by radar. One of the pilots stated his fear and frustration by air to ground radio. ""They\'ve surrounded my plane, what should I do?"" The phenomenal sights would bring about an Air Force press conference on July 29, with Major General John A. Samford in charge. The official explanation was ""temperature inversions,"" which supposedly caused ground lights to bounce off of clouds, giving the appearance of lighted craft in the skies. The naive and trusting press accepted this explanation at first, in lieu of any other ""reasonable"" one. This explanation was scoffed at, however, by Ufologists, knowing that it just did not explain what was seen by pilots and radar operators. Even Project Bluebook would also dismiss the ""temperature inversion"" explanation, as it later labeled the Washington sightings as ""unknown."" The radar operators offered their own reason for the rejecting the Air Force explanation. Radar controller Barnes would state, ""Inversion blips are always recognized by experts, we are familiar with what weather conditions, flying birds, and [other] such things can cause on radar. Temperature inversions on radar are typically weak returns and move at a slow ground speed. These blips were distinctly clear, reported as a very good return, solid and often traveled at unbelievable speeds.""The Washington D. C. sightings are a solid case of UFO activity. Literally hundreds of eyewitnesses saw the objects, and photographed them. Many of these were Air Force personnel, considered as reliable. Many of them made comment of the sightings, one was a Sergeant Harrison: ""I saw the ... light moving from the Northeast toward the range station. These lights did not have the characteristics of shooting stars. There were no trails and seemed to go out rather than disappear, and traveled faster than any shooting star I have ever seen."" The sightings continued throughout the month of July. (B J Booth)See transcript of article belowJuly 28, 1952 ""Saucer"" outran jet, pilot revealsInvestigation on in secret after chase over capital Radar spot blips like aircraft for nearly six hours - only 1,700 feet upBy Paul Sampson, Post Reporter Military secrecy veils an investigation of the mysterious, glowing aerial objects that showed up on radar screens in the Washington area Saturday night for the second consecutive week. A jet pilot sent up by the Air Defense Command to investigate the objects reported he was unable to overtake the glowing lights moving near Andrews Air Force Base. The CAA reported the objects traveled at ""predominantly lower levels"" - about 1700 feet. July 19. Air Force spokesmen said yesterday only that an investigation was being made into the sighting of the objects on the radar screen in the CAA Air Route Traffic Control Center at Washington National Airport, and on two other radar screens . Methods of the investigations were classified as secret, a spoken said. ""We have no evidence they are flying saucers; conversely we have no evidence they are not flying saucers. We don\'t know what they are,"" a spokesman added. The same source reported an expert from the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton Ohio, was here last week investigating the objects sighted July 19. The expert has been identified as Capt. E. J. Ruppelt. Reached by telephone at his home in Dayton yesterday, Ruppelt said he could make no comment on his activity in Washington. Capt. Ruppelt confirmed he was in Washington last week but said he had not come here to investigate the mysterious objects. He recalled he did make an investigation after hearing of the objects, but could not say what he investigated. Another Air Force spokesman said here yesterday the Air Force is taking all steps necessary to evaluate the sightings. ""The intelligence people,"" this spokesman explained, ""sent someone over to the control center at the time of the sightings and did whatever necessary to make the proper evaluation. Asked whether the radar equipment might have been malfunctioning, the spokesman said, ""radar, like the compass is not a perfect instrument and is subject to error."" He thought, however, the investigation would be made by persons acquainted with the problems of radar. Two other radar screens in the area picked up the objects. An employee of the National Airport control tower said the radar scope there picked up very weak ""blips"" of the objects. The tower radar\'s for ""short range"" and is not as powerful as that at the center. Radar at Andrews Air Force Base also registered the objects from about seven miles south of the base. A traffic control center spokesman said the nature of the signals on the radar screen ruled out any possibility they were from clouds or any other ""weather"" disturbance. ""The returns we received from the unidentified objects were similar and analogous to targets representing aircraft in flight,"" he said. The objects, ""flying saucer or what have you, appeared on the radar scope at the airport center at 9:08 PM. Varying from 4 to 12 in number, the objects appeared on the screen until 3:00 AM., when they disappeared. At 11:25 PM., two F-94 jet fighters from Air Defense Command squadron, at New Castle Delaware, capable of 600 hundred mph speeds, took off to investigate the objects. Airline, civil and military pilots described the objects as looking like the lit end of a cigarette or a cluster of orange and red lights. One jet pilot observed 4 lights in the vicinity of Andrews Air Force Base, but was not able to over-take them, and they disappeared in about two minutes. The same pilot observed a steady white light in the vicinity of Mt Vernon at 11:49 PM. The light, about 5 miles from him, faded in a minute. The lights were also observed in the Beltsville, MD., vicinity. At 1:40 AM two-other F-94 jet fighters took off and scanned the area until 2:20 AM., but did not make any sightings. Visible two daysAlthough ""unidentified objects"" have been picked up on radar before, the incidents of the last two Saturdays are believed to be the first time the objects have been picked up on radar-while visible to the human eye. Besides the pilots, who last Saturday saw the lights, a woman living on Mississippi Ave., told the Post she saw a very ""bright light streaking across the sky towards Andrews Air Force Base about 11:45 PM. Then a second object with a tail like a comet whizzed by, and a few seconds later, a third passed in a different direction toward Suntland, she said. Radar operators plotted the speed of ""Saturday night\'s visitors"" at from 38 to 90 mph, but one jet pilot reported faster speeds for the light he saw. The jet pilot reported he had no apparent ""closing speed"" when he attempted to reach the lights he saw near Andrews Air Force Base. That means the lights were moving at least as fast as his top speed-a maximum of 600 mph. One person who saw the lights when they first appeared in this area did not see them last night. He is E.W. Chambers, an engineer at Radio Station WRC, who spotted the lights while working early the morning of July 20 at station\'s Hyattsville tower.Chambers said he was sorry he had seen the lights because he had been skeptical about ""flying saucers"" before. Now he said, he sort of ""wonders"" and worries about the whole thing. Leon Davidson, 804 South Irving St. Arlington, a chemical engineer who made an exhaustive study of ""flying saucers"" as a hobby, said yesterday reports of saucers in the East, have been relatively rare. Davidson has studied the official report on the saucers, including some of the secret portions never made public, and analyzed all the data in the report. Davidson, whose study of saucers is impressively detailed and scientific, said he believes the lights are American ""aviation products"" - probably ""circular flying wings,"" using new type jet engines that permit rapid acceleration and relatively low speeds. He believes they are either ""new fighter,"" guided missiles or piloted guided missiles. He cited some of the recent jet fighters, including the Navy\'s new ""F-4-D, which has a radical ""bat-wing,"" as examples of what the objects might resemble. Davidson thinks the fact that the lights have been seen in this area indicates the authorities may be ready to disclose the ""new aircraft"" in the near future. Previously, most of the ""verified saucers"" have been seen over sparsely inhabited areas, Davidson explained, and now, when they appear here, it may indicate that ""secrecy"" is not so important any more.', ' 1952, San Jose, California-Two Scientists Reports Sighting DiscsApril 25, 1952. Dr. W (biochemist) and Dr. Y (bacteriologist), both employed by a private company, about 11:00 a.m. were driving to their office when Y saw something odd overhead that seemed to be moving against the wind. They entered the company parking lot and got out of the car to look. Directly over a building across the street was a small, metallic-looking disc, tilted at about a 20 degree angle and rotating around a vertical axis, wobbling ""like the motion of a disc in a water meter"". The distance was estimated to be about 50 ft, and the disc appeared to be 4-5 feet in diameter The wobble allowed them to judge the thickness as about 1.5 feet as the disc proceeded directly over their heads, continuing to rotate and wobble. No sound or exhaust emission of any sort was detected. It moved in an arc about 40-50 feet overhead very slowly, perhaps 8-10 m.p.h. When it neared some railroad yards, the disc curved around and made a fairly distinct turn, heading back toward them. At this point Dr. Y suddenly saw something else overhead, which Dr. W also then saw: a black object at high altitude hovering motionless under an overcast (later determined to be about 10,000 ft). It was round, and apparently much larger than the silvery disc, perhaps 100 ft in diameter As they watched, two identical objects came into position as if they had dropped out of the cloud overcast, and the three objects jittered around like boats in a stream"". About this time the small disc had neared again, still moving slowly. Suddenly it stopped spinning, hung motionless for a moment, then rapidly climbed towards the NNE in the general direction of Mt. Hamilton. At the same time that the small disc began its climb, one of the three black objects left the formation and headed in the same general direction. The black object and the climbing disc seemed to be on a converging course, when suddenly both seemed to disappear into the overcast. The remaining two black objects maintained their original position for another minute or so, then one of them headed off to the north and out of sight, while the other went directly up into the clouds and disappeared, terminating the incident at about 11:15 a.m. The two scientists immediately went into their offices and dictated accounts of the sighting for a permanent record. Dr. W felt obliged to make an official report and placed a call to Moffett Field. While waiting on the line for someone to be found to take his account, he had second thoughts about exposing himself to personal ridicule and hung up, so no report was made to the Air Force or other agencies. Special significance: In addition to the observation by scientifically trained witnesses, and loss of an official report due to the ridicule factor, the scientists\' reaction is instructive. They had found it ""a most disturbing experience:\' They had been forced to the conclusion that they had seen some objects of such unusual propulsion characteristics that it was difficult to think of it as anything other than extraterrestrial. As Dr. W said, ""...it utilized some propulsion method not in the physics books."" He had been ""worried ever since,"" mentioning historical evidence that inferior civilizations tend to go under when contacted by more advanced technologies.

', '1952-Air Force Bomber Encounter with DiscsDavis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Arizona, May 1, 1952 THE EVENT:Early in the 1952 UFO sighting wave two discs approached and paced a B-36 bomber in the vicinity of Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Arizona. On May 1, 1952, Major Rudy Pestalozzi, a base intelligence officer, along with an airman, looked up as a B-36 flew overhead and saw two shiny discs overtake the bomber, slow to its speed and position themselves alongside. The bomber crew, startled by the experience, made an unscheduled landing at the base and were interrogated at length by Major Pestalozzi, who happened to be the base UFO officer. Members of the flight crew had crowded into the starboard blister aft of the wing and looked down at a slight angle to see the closest disc, which was lens- or double-disc-shaped and about 20-25 feet in diameter. After about 20 seconds, the objects peeled off at an angle of 70-80 degrees from the flight path of the B-36 and sped away. Major Pestalozzi sent a comprehensive report of the incident to Project Blue Book. Within the next two months the summer 1952 UFO sighting wave reached a crescendo, generating national headlines and stirring up major Government interest, as radar repeatedly detected UFOs, and jet interceptors engaged in cat-and-mouse pursuits. www.nicap.orgsource:J.

Stafford, USNavy (Retired)   Half a century ago, three Navy aviators saw something high above their Greenland base that baffled them.   It was August 1952. I was officer in charge of a detachment of three Navy patrol planes operating out of the new US air base at Thule, in northwest Greenland, some 80 miles from the North Pole. The primary mission assigned our four engine, World War II Privateers was ""ice reconnaissance."" That meant flying out over the Kennedy Channel, Smith Sound, Baffin Bay, and the Davis Strait and plotting the location of the pack ice and large bergs.    That data was relayed to the ships that each summer re-supplied the chain of arctic radar stations known as the DEW (distant early warning) line.   Our secondary job, not to interfere with ice reconnaissance, was to support a group of scientists conducting cosmic ray research. About once a week, when weather conditions were right, they sent up a huge, translucent ""Skyhook"" balloon with a package of sensative photographic plates sus- pended under it.    The balloons would drift downwind at an altitude of 90,000-100,000 feet, where the atmosphere (spun thinner near the poles by the rotation of the earth) was sufficiently attenuated to permit the cosmic rays to make their telltale traces on the photographic plates.    When the plates had been exposed for a few hours, the scientists would send a radio signal to the balloon, exploding a small charge, cutting the plates loose, and returning them to earth under a large, bright red parachute.   Our job was to fly above any overcast, keep the high balloons in sight, and report the landing location of the parachuted plates for recovery by helicopter.    The high-flying gas bags were equipped by low power, low frequency radio transmitters to which we would tune our radio compasses so their needles always pointed toward the balloons.   These were easy flights, always in good weather and always at an altitude safely above the tall, cloud-shrouded bergs and coastel rocks we often had to dodge on ice patrol.    Each of us had two or three of those ""milk runs"" while deployed to Thule, and we rather enjoyed the change of tactics and routine, as well as the virtuous feeling that we were helping to advance the cause of science.   This is why I was surprised to find one of the other plane commanders as tense and pale on return from a balloon chase as though it had been a hairy combat mission or a close encounter with a berg or a mountaintop.    Lt. John Callahan was a salty, steady professional pilot, so I knew when I saw him walking in from his plane that something serious had happened on that flight.   ""What the hell\'s the matter John?"" I asked him. ""You look as if you\'d just survived a midair!"" ""Ed, you\'re not going to be-lieve it. I\'m not even sure I do... and I SAW it. And so did O\'Flaherty and Merchant. At least most of it. And I don\'t think they believe it either.""   I followed John into the line shack where he wrote up some minor gripes on his airplane, then into our little ready room where we poured ourselves coffees and sat down. John was not acting at all like the Callahan I knew.    Although he was an experienced and highly competent naval aviator, John Callahan\'s normal manner was outgoing and cheerful, even jovial, with lots of smiles and laughter and banter... even after a low-level hurricane penetration or a long patrol in instru- ment weather. Not this day.    Now he was deadly serious and obviously shaken. The last time I had seen a man like this was in wartime.   Here is John Callahan\'s story:   He was flying at 10,000 feet in the clear with the balloon in sight high above and the radio compass needle locked on to the balloon\'s transmitter. Through the one set of binoculars carried in each aircraft, he and his copilot, Lt. (jg) Bill O\'Flaherty, occasionally inspected the balloon and its instrument package, trailing beneath like the tail of a kite. Everything looked normal for most of the flight.    Then, on a routine check with the binoculars, John found something very abnormal about the balloon and its payload. He looked for a long time and then passed the glasses to O\'Flaherty.   ""Take a look at our target,"" he told the young officer, ""and tell me what you see."" O\'Flaherty looked, lowered the glasses and glanced sharply at John, then looked again. ""Well?"" ""Jesus Christ, John there are three bright silver discs attached to that instrument pod! They weren\'t there the last time I looked. Where the hell did they come from?""   Callahan took the glasses back and looked again. They were still there exactly as the copilot had described, three shining, saucer-shaped metallic objects clustered on the hanging trail of the balloon just above the black dot of the science package.   On the intercom Callahan called the plane captain to the cock-pit and handed him the binoculars. ""Take a look Merchant. What do you think?""    The captain\'s reacton was the same as the copilot\'s. ""What the hell are they? Where did they come from?""   Callahan took the glasses back and studied the strange objects for several minutes while O\'Flaherty maneuvered the Privateer to keep the target in sight. Suddenly Callahan sucked in his breath and held it.    What he was seeing could not be happen- ing. The three objects had detached themselves from the tail of the balloon and formed up into a compact vee.    As Callahan watched incredulously, they executed what looked at that dis tance like a vertical bank to the left and accelerated to a blinding speed that took them out of sight, climbing in about three seconds.   Callahan handed the glasses back to O\'Flaherty. ""They\'re gone,"" he said slowly, ""CLIMBING from 90,000 feet. Never saw anything turn so tight or move so fast.""   Back in the ready room after the instrument pod had landed and its position had be reported, this was the aspect of the phenomenon that most affected Callahan. ""Jesus, Ed,"" he told me, ""from the angle of the sky those things passed through in the three seconds they were in sight, at that distance, they must have been going tens of thousands of miles an hour. They must have pulled a hundred Gs in that turn. And what the hell climbs out, ACCELERATING from 90,000 feet?"" John sat down that day, while it was still clear in his head, and wrote a full report of the incident. It went through the chain of command to the Office of Naval Intelligence. A report was also made to the Air Force authorities at Thule.  There never has been an explanation, nor even an acknowledgment of the report. The phenomenon exists today only in the memory of John C. Callahan, his copilot, his plane captain, and I, to whom it was told so vividly when it was fresh.

Certain features are strikingly similar to  Mrs. Suzanne E. Knight\'s sighting  in Maryland, at about the same time. The witness\' report follows: About 5:30 a.m., August 25, 1952, while Squyres was driving to work from his home in Frontenac, Kansas, he saw a low-hovering object with clearly-defined windows in a heavily wooded area about seven miles northeast of Pittsburg.  ""My hair rose straight up on the back of my head,"" he said when reporting the incident later. He described the object as resembling two turtle shells, or two oval meat platters, placed edge to edge. Along the rim where the two halves joined he noticed a series of small propellers six to twelve inches in diameter projecting outward at close intervals all the way around the object. These propellers were revolving at high speed.  Squyres said the object was about 75 feet long, 45 feet wide and 25 feet high, and was rocking slightly back and forth as it hovered over a field near the highway. The body was of a dull aluminum color and across the top and extending down to the rim of the object were several rectangular windows, through which Squyres could see a bluish light fluctuating from dark to light.  He observed considerable activity behind these windows but it was obscured ""like a window shade pulled down. I could see figures behind it."" Forward of these windows was another rectangular window which was clear and through it the witness could plainly see the head and shoulders of a single man, sitting motionless, and facing the forward edge of the object.  ""I definitely saw a human being through the window,"" the witness asserted. He turned off the motor of his car and got out. He could hear a steady throbbing sound and as he approached on foot to within a hundred feet, the object suddenly rose straight up into the air and out of sight, making a sound like a ""covey of a hundred quail taking off."" The vegetation beneath the object was blown about as the object rose up.  Squyres was convinced that the object was ""piloted by humans, and not some men from Mars."" The witness returned to the scene later with officials from the radio station, who verified the fact that the vegetation appeared disturbed, ""like the backwash of where the thing took off."" A later investigation by Air Force officials confirmed these findings, and the reliability of the witness was termed ""good"" in the official report (see Project Blue Book Special Report #14). source:http://www.nicap.org/newlook/section_VII.htm', 'The Tremonton, Utah UFO Color Film1952 - Warrant Officer D.C.

The object continued flying over the field to their right and hovered over a house about 100 yards away, where it quivered “like a jelly.”  It appeared as wide as the house.The drawing of the object shows a dark bowl-shaped bottom, with a clear dome on top. The dome was divided into vertical thirds, one third showing white light, one third, amber light, and the final third, green light.In the lit dome area, several humanoid figures were seen moving, sometimes appearing to bend down as though looking at something below the rim (see sketch).The object began moving in a jerky manner, its light become much more intense and Mr. Milakovic felt his eyes burning.

Traveling at 18,000 feet, Captain Robert F. Reilman, Flight Officer A. J. Farmer and Safety Officer Rick Morrison first noticed ""a red flashing light"" at their altitude. In his report to NICAP, the pilot said the light was at their 11:30 position about halfway between Jacksonville and Orlando, Florida. ""Who\'s this at our 11:30 position?"" Capt. Reilman asked a nearby control center. The center replied that they had been in communication with a plane 15 miles away. ""Well, this guy isn\'t 15 miles away,"" the pilot replied. ""He\'s at 11:30, has one flashing red light and three - now four red lights strung out - one red light turned to green."" At this point, Capt. Reilman ""prepared to take evasive action."" The center radioed back that they had spotted no targets on their radar scope. ""Come on,"" Reilman responded, ""he\'s going right by us at our 9:00 position."" The center still replied that they had no targets and that no balloons were in the vicinity. ""I dropped the subject and proceeded to Miami,"" the Captain concluded. Pacings of ground vehicles have often badly frightened the witnesses, showing that official debunking and denials have not abated fears of UFOs.

Studying it through binoculars, she saw that it was hemispherical in shape (dome-like) with four protrusions like legs on the underside.

Buff Ledge Camp in Vermont would be the site of a visitation by four UFOs which would appear, make revolutionary aerial maneuvers, and alter the lives of at least two young people. Buff Ledge was a girls camp located north of Burlington on Lake Champlain. During their tenure as summer camp employees, Michael Lapp, a sixteen year old maintenance man, and 19 year old water ski instructor Janet Cornell were relaxing at a boat dock on a slack day. On this particular August afternoon, the swim team had a made a trip to Burlington to compete in a meet, and the camp was virtually deserted. Late in the afternoon, the two friends were enjoying the view of the sun setting  over the water, when a bright light appeared in the darkening sky. At first, Michael thought  they were being treated to a beautiful, close up view of the planet Venus. All of a sudden, the glowing light began to move downward, and ever closer to Michael and Janet. The object, at first a round glow, now began to flatten out as it came even closer. Michael shouted, ""Wow! Venus is falling."" As the two steadfastly watched the light, three smaller lights seemed to drop from the larger one, which quickly moved up and disappeared from sight. The three smaller objects began to move over the lake. They were obviously under intelligent control. The objects put on a show for Michael and Janet, doing zigzag maneuvers, loops, and then descended like falling leaves. The three objects now moved even closer to the two baffled teenagers. After forming a triangle, two of the objects pulled back. Michael would later recall a sound ""like a thousand tuning forks"" when the two left the third craft alone.The one remaining UFO passed over Michael and Janet, then shot upward and momentarily disappeared. It very soon reappeared, tilted to one side, and dropped into the lake. A couple of minutes seemed to pass before the object reemerged from the water, and began gliding straight toward them! The object was now close enough to see a transparent dome occupied by two childlike creatures. Michael would describe the beings as having elongated necks, big heads, and no hair. Their eyes were also large, and extended around the side of their heads. Michael began to sense a kind of mental communication with the two beings. Watching them intently, Michael slapped his knee, and to his surprise, one of the occupants mimicked his movement. The craft now moved directly overhead, and shot a beam at Michael and Janet. Grabbing Janet\'s shoulder, Michael pulled both of them on their backs on the dock. Suddenly, Michael was overcome with the fear of being kidnapped. He remembers screaming, ""We don\'t want to go!""  The light from the beam was so bright that Michael recalls being able to see the bones in his hand, like an X-ray.  The two teenagers both later related that the beam had a ""liquid"" feeling to it, and gave them the sense of free floating.Their next conscious thoughts would be that of staring at the object again from the dock. The sky was now totally black, and Michael wondered how long he had been in this one spot. Looking at Janet, he could see that she was in a trancelike state; drowsy and disoriented. They now heard the welcome sounds of the swim team returning from their meet in Burlington. The UFO now moved upward into the black sky, flashed its light beam repeatedly, and then vanished from sight.  Strangely, Michael and Janet did not discuss what had happened to them, not now, and not for the next couple of weeks, when camp season ended. Maybe the strange things they had seen over the lake this evening were just optical illusions. Maybe they weren\'t. After their summer camp jobs were over, Michael and Janet went their separate ways. During the next five years, Michael rarely thought about that night. But in time, he began to have disturbing dreams...dreams about being kidnapped; abducted...against his will. The dreams would come... like they did... then the dreams would vanish...like they did. It would be ten years after his harrowing experience that Michael made a decision to contact the Center for UFO Studies, and search for answers. Investigator Walter Webb was assigned to the case, and after hearing Michael\'s story, suggested regressive hypnosis to help rid him of his emotional strife and the frightening dreams. During Michael\'s hypnosis, he vividly recalled his experiences on that night in August 1968. He remembered how the beam of light lifted him into the crafts interior; how he entered a bigger craft,  and how he saw Janet lying on a table being examined. The small beings shined a light into her eyes, scraped her skin, and took fluids from her body. ""The aliens all looked alike, Michael recalled, and had those large eyes, a mouth without lips, no ears, and two small openings for a nose."" Michael also described the beings as having three pointed, web-like digits for fingers, and their bodies felt ""damp and clammy."" The aliens related to Michael that their mission was to ""make life like ours... other places.""Janet also underwent the regression, and her descriptions only went to verify Michael\'s. She recalled feeling ""cold"" on the examining table, with something ""pulling her hair and pinching her neck."" The abduction of Michael Lapp and Janet Cornell certainly falls within the general pattern of abductions reported by many others. To confirm the facts of their fantastic story, Webb located several other members of the camp who had witnessed the strange lights over Lake Champlain the very night of the abduction! Two other employees reported a similar experience which had occurred earlier that same summer, when they observed unidentified flying objects hovering over the lake for about twenty minutes. Although Michael and Janet\'s experience was not reported for ten years after the fact, it is still a well documented case of alien abduction.author, B. J.

Some lights in the field back of the house, apparently about 200 feet away, attracted their attention and they went to the window to see what was going on. To their astonishment, they saw a dome-shaped object hovering about 10 feet off the ground. The underside of the object was illuminated, and the light covered an area about 20 feet in diameter on the ground. Since they were in a fairly isolated area with no telephone (they had just moved into the house), the couple became frightened. They could hear a buzzing sound, like a transformer, coming from the object. The time was about 2:30 a.m. Mr. and Mrs. John Meloney of the New Hampshire NICAP Subcommittee investigated the report in close cooperation with the Claremont police. In their interview with the couple, they learned that the UFO had remained over the field until about 4:30 a.m. Then the humming became very loud, the light grew to high intensity and the UFO moved away at a low angle upward to the west and disappeared. In the garage, the family dog whined loudly as the UFO departed. Two separate groups of witnesses have been located by the Subcommittee. The reports seem to indicate beyond a reasonable doubt that something unexplained was in the area. source:http://www.nicap.org/newlook/section_VI.htm"", '1968, Claremont, New Hampshire-Dome-Shaped Object Hovers 10 ft above GroundLake Erie, USA 1988:Events from the Lake Erie, March 4, 1988 in the USA.Sheila and Henry Baker were driving home with their three children about 8:35 p.m., after going out to dinner. As they neared the waterfront, Sheila noticed something hovering over the lake and they drove down to the beach to investigate and got out of the car. The moon was bright and there was ice on the lake; Sheila could hear it cracking like claps of thunder. Plainly visible was a huge, gunmetal gray football-shaped object that was rocking back and forth, blinding white light emanating from both ends, but it was silent. Then the object began moving, swinging one end toward the shore and descending. The Bakers became frightened, ran back to their car and fled. When they got home, the object was still visible from a window that faced the lake. The object moved out over the ice and continued to descend, with red and blue lights now flashing in sequence along its lower edge. Sheila then called the Eastlake police to report a UFO, and was finally referred to the Coast Guard. Suddenly 5 or 6 bright yellow triangular objects shot out of the center of the large object and began darting around independently. Once they stopped and hovered, point up, around the parent object, then sped away to the north, turned east, then inland toward the Perry nuclear power plant. At this point Sheila called the Coast Guard, which sent a team to their house to investigate. Seaman James Power and Petty Officer John Knaub arrived towing a Boston Whaler, a seaworthy boat. When Sheila pointed to the main craft and some of the triangular objects still zipping around it, the men drove closer to the lake to investigate, accompanied by the Bakers. At the lakefront they could hear the ice rumbling and roaring. In their incident report later sent by teletype to the Coast Guard headquarters in Detroit, Michigan, the men were quoted as saying that ""the ice was cracking and moving abnormal amounts as the object came closer to it."" Power and Knaub gave a running report to their base via the two-way radio in their Chevy Suburban on what they were seeing. The window was down, and the Bakers overheard them saying words to the effect, ""Be advised the object appears to be landing on the lake... There are other objects moving around it. Be advised these smaller objects are going at high rates of speed. There are no engine noises and they are very, very low."" One of the triangles zoomed straight toward the Coast Guard vehicle, a blur of light, then veered east, straight up, and came down beside the parent object. Two witnesses in separate locations also reported seeing the triangles. Suddenly the triangles returned and one by one entered the side of the parent object as it seemed to land on the ice. The ellipse flashed a series of red, blue, and yellow lights, the light emanating from the end of the object turned from white to red, and the triangles re-emerged and hovered above it. The noise from the ice abruptly ceased, and the lights and triangles disappeared.

At 0358, the pilot then requested an instrument guided approach, and received instructions. The pilot called, and then the transmitter went dead, but they could hear instructions from the ground.

We can\'t see anything visually.  JAG 31, request you have someone report to base ops after you land.  What we have, then, was a group of sightings made by men on the ground, at the missile sites scattered around the base. There was radar sightings from ground and weather\'s radar. There were visual sightings from the crew of the B-52, and an airborne radar sighting where the target traveled at 3,000 miles per hour.  Scope photographs were taken. There were sightings made by S.Sgt. Bond the FSC at Nov. Flight, S.Sgt. Smith at Oscar-1, Julelt, and Mike Flight Team and a number of men in widely scattered locations.  The object landed at location AA-43 and the entire observation lasted for 45 minutes. Fourteen other people in separate locations also reported the UFO. Security alarm were activated for both the outer and inner ring at the missile sites. When the guards arrived at the outer door it was open and the combination lock on the inner door had been moved.  Editors Note: The case in my estimation was never investigated properly. Project Blue Book personnel never sent a representative and the case was essentially written off despite the interest of several Strategic Air Command generals including 15th Air Force\'s Major General Nichols.  The sighting was officially explained by on November 13, by Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla who wrote, ""The following conclusions have been reached after a thorough study of the data submitted to Foreign Technology Division. The ground visual sightings appear to be of the star Sirius and the B-52, which was flying in the area.  The B-52 radar contact and the temporary loss of the UHF transmission could be attributed to a plasma similar to ball lightning. The air visual from the B-52 could be the star Vega, which was on the horizon at the time, or it could be a light on the ground, or possibly a plasma. No further investigation by the Foreign Technology Division is contemplated.  This is a classic Blue Book case where dozens of Air Force personnel who see B-52s and stars nightly have their testimony doubted. They know when they\'ve seen a UFO. In this case the scientists doing the Condon report agreed that this was a real UFO.  The apparent damage to the missile site and disruption of B-52 radio transmissions was in my opinion a threat to primary nuclear offensive systems and should not have been trivialized. The records speak for themselves. This article was taken from Scientific Ufology written by Captain Kevin D. Randle USAFR.  I consider this his finest book and recommend its reading. This case like thousands of others are explained away with any simple mundane explanation that can be found. Yet many cases involve the tampering of key government weapon systems.  It appears Quintanilla either did not care or had instructions to write off most of the sightings with any available excuse. I wonder why the reports were white washed, while the Air Force\'s scientific advisor Alan Hynek was coming to the opposite conclusion that, UFOs were real? source:Captain Kevin Randle book ""Scientific Ufology"" ', 'Salisbury, Massachusetts-Spring, 1968-Trees Damaged by UFOI got a case from a phone call. They seemed to be frightened by a loud noise about 3 AM in April of 1968. When they went out after the noise they noticed that 2 trees had been stripped downward of all its branches and the tree was scarred of all its bark on the inside. All the other trees were ok. I asked them if they touched anything, the answer was ""NO"".  So I put on my  leather gloves and put the pieces of bark and strips of wood in a cloth bag and sealed it. I took pictures of the area and the trees and the surrounding area. Some of the branches that did not break were hanging downward. Four trees were involved. They formed a diamond shaped area much like a baseball field bases,  or 2 Vs facing each other. The branches that were on the ground were scarred from heat and looked burnt although none had a burnt smell to them. They smelled a lot like sulfur!I took the samples and put them in a box and sent them to APRO.  Along with the samples, pictures, and the statements from the people about the noise and time of hearing the damage (3 AM)  The funny thing was and is to this day in my mind, How did it disappear?  APRO got the samples and thanked me for the event report. One thing APRO asked me, the people whose back yard tees were destroyed from ABOVE and down and I still wonder to this day. Where and how did the object go?There was nothing indicating ANYTHING WENT UP! There was no rocks, no hard substance or any hard object that could cause ALL FOUR TREES to lose its branches upward or downward!!!! Yet the ground and the tree branches smelled like sulfur! From what APRO told me at the time there was every indication  that the branches from all four trees were hit with the same object and at a downward angle. When they received the package,  the grass, the fauna and the branches had a strong sulfur smell to them. The source of the trees being affected ""UNIDENTIFIED.""  The ground area, dropped and flora of the ground was burnt with the same object and smell was consistent with the branches from the trees and the leaves and grasses and ferns on the ground...The pictures confirmed the object came down ward and then disappeared when it hit the ground,  yet no holes or residue from the object that caused a lot of damage.

1987, ,"[' Abduction on North Canol Road, Northern Canada  1987 Kevin\'s Account written, Feb 2001 posted March 21, 2004) In August or September 1987 (later determined to be Wednesday September 2, 1987), I left Ross River (where I lived) and headed up the North Canol Road by myself on my motor bike for moose (hunting). I was planning on spending 3 days in the area between Sheldon Lake and Macpass. A guy I worked with and a friend of his were to leave a day later and I was to meet them for some fishing. We were all to stay at a trailer at Dewhurst Creek. I left Ross River early in the morning and the temperature started to drop. Then it started to rain very hard and very cold. When I got to Gravel Creek, I stopped at Art John\'s Cabin and put on extra clothes while standing under the edge of his roof. I knew the rain would not stop, so I got back on my bike and headed off. I arrived at the trailer ½ hour before dark, very cold and very tired. I lit up a fire, cooked supper and went straight to bed looking forward to the morning hunt. Over night the rain had stopped. At daybreak (September 3, 1987) I put my gear and my gun on my bike and headed towards Macpass. A couple of miles down the road, I was putting along at about 10 mph looking into the trees and watching the hillsides. I decided to stop for a restroom break. I stopped where I could see some mountainsides and some valleys. I parked on the right side of the road. The sun was shining; the air was perfectly still and a bit cool. I was standing just in front of my bike watching the mountains to the south, when I noticed to the left out of the corner of my eye, what I first thought was an airplane. It was 400 to 500 yards away and about the size of a DC-3 plane or a full-size school bus. It was travelling north to south, at about 40 yards above ground and moving maybe 30 km/h. Right away I thought ""boy is he low"". I blinked my eyes because I couldn\'t make out any tail fin or wings. It had what looked like portholes all along the side of it. It was cigar shaped with a grey strip down the middle and a dark green on top and bottom. I thought to myself, ""something\'s wrong with this picture"", then I realised there was no sound! If it was an airplane, the roar would have filled the valley. As I watched, it seemed to partially dematerialize and then return to solid form, it did this as it was moving, a couple of times. Then it dawned on me, oh, oh, I don\'t think I should be seeing this; it\'s a UFO and probably doesn\'t want to be seen! I crouched down on the road, hiding behind the roadside grass. I then watched it go behind a cone-shaped hill and not come out. I stood up looking for it and feeling very excited and happy about what I saw and thinking they didn\'t even know they were being watched. I was standing beside my bike when I heard a loud metallic clunk behind me around the corner. Right away I thought, somebody must be here and I\'ve got to tell them what I saw. The noise I heard sounded like a heavy trunk lid on a car slamming shut. I quickly walked along the edge of the road to the corner to see who was there. I came face to face (about 20 yards) with 2 grey creatures in blue jump suits, about 5 ft. tall with big insect looking heads, pointy faces, big eyes, thin arms, body and legs. I immediately thought ""they\'re not little green men*, they\'re grasshopper people"". At that same instant, the one on the left raised his left hand to his waist, which held some type of flashlight device and I saw a bright flash of light come from it. I instantly felt paralyzed and was convinced time had stopped, everything was black, no sound. I tried to yell ""No!"" but all that came out was a distorted grunt. Next thing I knew I was standing on the side of the road scared, shaking and confused. Within seconds I remembered all of this that had just taken place and I thought, ""I\'m getting out of here before they get me again."" I turned around to get my bike and for some reason it was not there, then I noticed it was on the other side of the road. I said to myself, ""what the hell is this? I didn\'t put it there"". Still panicking I rushed over and got on it and realized the keys were gone. I always left the keys in it, that way I could not lose them while sneaking around in the bush. I immediately started looking down the road and suddenly saw them in my hand. I started my bike and raced back to the trailer. I was feeling scared and amazed at the same time and then noticed that all the shadows of the trees were pointing in a different direction than that of the morning sun. About 15 minutes later I was at the trailer. Half an hour later it was dark. I thought ""no way, I only left here an hour ago, what\'s going on?"" I was really confused then, I said to myself, ""I\'m not telling anybody about this, I\'ll just forget the whole thing"". I put on a pot of coffee and could then hear a soft humming sound above the trailer. I could also feel a soft vibration in everything (trailer, air, etc.). After about 10 minutes it had all stopped. I had a very strong feeling that they were outside. I did not look out the windows. Later that night I still couldn\'t sleep and while having my coffee I began to have flashbacks of the past events. I remember being in a dream-like state watching scenery flash by underneath as if I was flying. I watched mountains and rivers and forests go by at a very high rate of speed. I then became aware of other sounds and seemed to wake up. I opened my eyes and could see nothing but black, very deep and inky black. As I was looking at this, the blackness pulled back, revealing a face, I had been looking into the eyes of a grey type creature. I could hear in my mind a voice saying ""there is nothing to worry about"". I could hear him talking in my mind. There were 3 or 4 of these types walking around, but only one talked to me. The two I saw earlier on the road, I never saw again. (Note: the aliens that he saw at this point were of the typical ""grey type"" while the ones at the edge of the road were more insectoid.) I then sat up and had an idea of what might be going on and I asked, ""Are you going to do experiments on me?"" and the one said, ""They\'ve already been done."" I felt really good then because, except for a strange sensation in my hands everything felt normal. I kept rubbing my hands together but did not look at them, as there was a totally strange environment to look at instead. I experienced no discomfort. The being nearest me asked if I would like to see my home planet and I said sure. I then walked over to the window, where there was a machine that looked like a big copy machine. He asked me not to touch it, I replied ""Don\'t worry, I\'m not touching anything in here"". He then said, that bright white star is your home. I didn\'t know anything about astronomy at the time, but I always thought earth was blue, so right away I thought he\'s lying. He also explained to me about space and stars etc. but I can\'t remember any of it now. I was also asked if I would like to go on a trip. I replied ""Not yet"", I felt very honoured to be asked and I did want to go, but felt that the time was not right. Then I was told I would have to forget all of this. I was disappointed at hearing this. The first part of the experience was very scary, but once I was with them, I found them to be friendly, helpful and their looks didn\'t bother me. They actually seemed like old friends. They gave me a clear glass, ¾ full with a yellow liquid and said to drink it up, it would make me forget everything. I told them, I did not want to forget an experience like this. It should be remembered! I was told it was for my own good that I forget. So I took 3 little sips and put the glass down. Next thing I know, I\'m on the road by my bike, scared to death and wanting to get out of there. The next day I met up with the other two guys and never said anything to them.', '1987 - Alaska - Two UFO/Plane EncountersPublished: 4:12 PM 4/5/2010Alaska - Two UFO/Plane EncountersOn January 30, 1987, a US Air Force KC-135 was flying from Elmendorf AFB in Anchorage, Alaska, to Eielson AFB near Fairbanks.The crew of the KC-135 reported a large, silent, disc-shaped UFO at about 20,000 feet altitude. At this time, Anchorage radar control showed nothing unusual.In a moment, radar control asked the pilot of the plane if they still had the unknown object in sight. The frightened pilot replied yes, and added that the UFO was only 40 feet from the plane.The cockpit recording referenced the JAL - 1628 incident,  which had occurred only a month earlier.About 1/2 hour later, Anchorage Control Tower relayed a message from the FAA, informing the pilot to contact them upon landing. The FAA wanted a full report on the UFO seen by the crew.The very next day, on January 31, another similar sighting would occur over Alaskan skies. Alaska Airline\'s Flight 53 reported enormous, disc-like objects.These UFOs, according to the pilot\'s report, were ""tracking"" Flight 53. The Control Tower operator related to the pilot that they did not show anything unusual on their radar.The pilot of Flight 53 was very concerned, stating that the UFO was moving at a mile/per/second, which would be about 3,600 m/p/h.The pilot also stated that the UFO had almost immediately disappeared after flying under Flight 53.Neither of the two encounters were adequately explained by any conventional flying objects, or atmospheric anomalies, and remain a mystery.', ' Corydon, Indiana Video Film, August 23, 1987COMMENTS, INTERROGATING FI An official at Evansville-Regional Airport Control Tower was contacted on 24 August 1987. He was unable to shed any light on the object\'s cause or source. To his knowledge there is no known navigation light such as the orange lights being observed. However, an orange light could be produced by headlights at a distance as a result of air pollution, provided the object/headlights are approaching the witnesses. The absence of a green forward position light is suspect and the red position light should have been on the craft\'s ""left wing"". When the object was heading East, the steady red light was in the lead, which is not consistent with FAA regulations. There was an absence of a steady rear white position light. There is a possibility that the red light was not attached, but it ""appears"" to fly in a fixed position. That position changed several times, however, indicating some rotation.I personally observed this object from the very beginning. Its color, intensity and movements made it very suspect as a ""normal source"". Immediately eliminating any ""natural source"" I also find it difficult to place in a ""manmade source"" category, unless proper FAA lighting was not adhered to. This activity was observed near an airport and a moderately-sized city (Louisville, KY) where position lights and a see-and-be-seen situation is more of a life & death situation than other areas. There were no flashing red or white beacons or anti-collision lights at all, no belly strobes, and no steady white rear position light. There was no red light in a left wing position. If the ""aircraft"" were heading toward us and gliding to our left at the same time, the red should have been on the right or west side of the object. If going away from us, the red to the left would have been OK, except that the headlight (if that\'s what the orange light was} would have been pointing away from us. This was not a refueling operation. Not only do these not take place in areas close to airports, they are conducted at high-altitude, and the lights used are brilliant white. This was probably not any kind of helicopter for the same reasons mentioned previously. Mandatory position and anti -collision lights were absent. Position lights should be easy to see and the red one was very dim in comparison. If the object was further than we thought (the red light being so small that it could be seen only with binoculars), then the bright orange light was not only a dangerous distraction but much larger than it appeared. The actual ""apparent diameter"" of the orange verses the red appears to be about 6-to-1 on the observed video segment. However, the ratio could be much higher. The volume or intensity was about 200-to-l. The image on the videotape appears to be flatter than just. a ball of light. Because of the resolution of the camera it also does not show any color, but merely looks whitish. The red light appears duller, but the red does not appear. This resolution problem is not unusual for such a small target. MUFON Form 8, Photographic Evidence, was completed and submitted by the camcorder operator and State-Section Director/FIT Scott Wilkerson. Preliminary data provided indicates the object was ""filmed"" at 6x magnification on the zoom mode. We believe that the normal mode would have not resolved the red object. It is our opinion that the object is unidentified. NATURAL SOURCES have been completely ruled out. Of the MANMADE SOURCES, Balloons, Fixed Structures, Hoax, Missiles, Satellites were immediately ruled out. This leaves the remote possibility of aircraft, of course, but as witnesses (8 MUFON people, 5 qualified observers) and for reasons specified in the report, we are not convinced that this was any type of aircraft. Absent was the damning anomalistic motion or the over flight with total absence of sound. If the aircraft and the unidentified object were at approximately the same distance, the object would have been traveling at about half the speed of the aircraft, which may have been under stall speed.FINAL REPORT BY FI/STATE DIRECTORAugust 13, 1990The long-awaited computer analysis recently conducted by our new scientist/member David Cook, was received on August 4th, 1990, and is now part of this report. The object is considered unidentified, borderline significance. source:Francis Ridge, State Director, Field Investigator, MUFON Indianahttp://www.nicap.org/870823dir.htm', 'The Ilkley Moor Alien 1987One of the most unique accounts of alien abduction comes to us from the Ilkley Moor in Yorkshire, England. The witness and subject of this case is a former policeman named Philip Spencer. Spencer claims that in the early morning of December 1, 1987, he was taken aboard an unidentified flying craft, and after his release managed to snap a picture of one of the alien beings.The Ilkley Moor is very much as you would picture it. Reminiscent of the setting of the moors of Baskerville Hall in Conan Doyle\'s ""Hound of the Baskervilles,"" it is an eerie place. It has been said that ""The Ilkley Moor can scare you to death during daylight, and at night it\'s even worse.""It is a place of mystery. There is the Swastika stone; boulders etched with strange markings; the Badger Stone; and the Twelve Apostles stone circle.Many times the only living creatures on the moor are the sheep. Ilkley has other legends too, like the hovering lights at night, which bring occasional reports of UFOs. There are strange, swirling lights that are filtered through the fog and seem to have a mind of their own. Possibly some of the mysterious sights can be attributed to the not too distant Menwith Hill Military Base, or the nearby Leeds Bradford Airport.The activities of these two facilities will not, however, explain what happened to Spencer. There were also stories of strange creatures that roam across the moor at times.After four years of being a policeman in another city, Spencer had moved his wife and child to the Yorkshire area to be closer to her family. He was walking across the moor on this December morning heading for his father-in-law\'s house and on the way was hoping to get some photographs of the strange light tricks of the moor. To be able to get the images he desired he was using a high ASA rated film to compensate for the poor light in the area.Unfortunately, the picture that he took was somewhat blurred, but there is no doubt that the creature in the photo is a one of a kind being which basically resembled the small grays.Along with his camera, Spencer also took a compass to navigate through the fog before sufficient daylight shone through the moor. As he was searching for some photo angles, suddenly he caught the sight of a strange looking being in the slopes ahead of him. He aimed and snapped a picture of the creature which seemed to be gesturing for him to stay away.It then ran away. Spencer gathered his wits and took off in pursuit of the being. Today he says he doesn\'t know why. It was just an impulse reaction. He arrived just in time to get a glimpse of a flying craft with a domed top rise up from the moor and disappear into the sky. Atop the dome was a whitish square. He was not able to get a photograph of the object.Ilkley Moor Original Photo There was silence now. When he saw nothing else of the being or its craft, he began to walk to the nearest village. This walk took about 30 minutes, and during this time, a couple of things became apparent to him. First of all, his compass now pointed south instead of north, and secondly, the village clock showed the time an hour ahead of his...Spencer was confused now. Did he see what he thought he saw?To answer this burning question, he headed by bus to the nearest town with instant film development. Sure enough, he had a picture of the creature! It looked to be about 4 foot tall, and had a blue-green tint to its skin. He knew he had something of importance, or at least, he thought he did. He found the proper channels to contact UFO investigator Peter Hough.Hough knew what he was hearing was a ""too good to be true"" case, and it worried him, but after meeting Spencer, he was convinced that he was a man of integrity and was not seeking fame or fortune for his picture. There was no reason to not believe what Spencer had told him. Hough began a thorough investigation. The film with the alien picture would be the first thing to undergo professional scrutiny.The alien picture was first looked at by a wildlife photography expert. The object in the image was not an animal of any known kind. It could not be determined either way if the figure was animate or static. A reconstruction of the original site did establish the alien\'s height at or near 4 and one half feet.The photograph was next sent to Kodak laboratories in Hemel, Hempstead. An analysis showed that the object was indeed part of the original photo, and not superimposed. This conclusion did not, of course, determine what the creature was.Next, the picture was sent to the United States for computer enhancement and analysis. Dr. Bruce Maccabee, optical physicist with the United States Navy rendered his expert opinion;He stated that the slow film speed used for the low light conditions made the film too grainy for proper testing. ""I had great hopes that this case would prove definitive. Sadly circumstances prevent it from being so,"" Maccabee stated.Something strange was noticed in the picture. Appearing on the hill at exactly the spot where Spencer says the UFO was is a white square. Could it be that he had gotten a part of the UFO in the shot unknowingly? He was not sure.The final outcome of the investigation of the alien picture? There is not a way to prove hoax. There is also no way to prove that the strange creature on the moor is alien. I must state here that opinion on the authenticity of the picture is pretty much split among interested parties. Some UFO enthusiasts are hopeful that more evidence will emerge to substantiate the claims of Philip Spencer. There are those who do not believe that the figure is alien. Why?... since there is not definitive proof either way.? Because they don\'t want to.The picture taken of the creature was in color, and what is mostly available on the net is a cropped, black and white photo. We have a scanned copy of the large color photo and a large version of the black and white film. See them both HERE.Hough\'s next step in his investigation was to look at Spencer\'s compass. There was no doubt that it would have had to be subjected to a strong magnetic field to alter its direction from north to south. Hough discovered that a magnetic resonance scanner would duplicate the effect.There was also the fact that there was no way to prove that the reversed polarity of the compass was accomplished at the alleged scene of the event.To perpetuate a hoax, Spencer may have affected the magnetic change before going into the moor. Hough was not done yet. He utilized a University to do radiation tests at the scene. No radiation was found. He also had Spencer tested by a psychologist. In his opinion, Spencer was telling the truth, as he knew it.Spencer had begun to have strange dreams of starry skies, and was still puzzled by the missing time he experienced, so the final test would be subjecting him to regressive hypnosis. The session was conducted by Dr. Jim Singleton, at Arthur Tomlinson\'s home, on March 16, 1988. Also there were Peter Hough, and Mathew Hill, a journalist friend of Hough who was to operate the three tape recorders.Here is a transcript of the session:JS- I want you to cast your mind back to the 1st December last year when you set off across the moor. I want you to clear your mind back to that and I want you to re-experience that. I want you to tell me what you experienced.Spencer- I\'m walking along the moor, oh! its quite windy. There is a lot of clouds. Walking up towards some trees. I see this little something, can\'t tell, but he\'s green it\'s moving up towards me. (We later found out that Jon had took the photo after his abduction and the creature was waving goodbye) Oh! I\'m stuck I can\'t move and the creature still coming towards me. I\'m stuck and everything gone fuzzy. I\'m, I\'m floating along in the air I want to get down! (He later told us he was levitated 2 feet off the ground and the creature was in front of him like a child pulling a balloon on a string). I still can\'t get down and I don\'t like it. I\'m going round this corner and this green thing is in front of me. Oh God! I want to get down! (long pause) (breathing faster) There\'s a there is a big silver saucer thing there\'s a door in it. And I don\'t want to go in there. (worried sound in his voice) (sigh) Everything gone black now. (pause).JS- you say everything gone black?Spencer- Mmm! I can\'t see anything like I\'m asleep, can\'t hear anything. (short pause) There\'s a bright light now. Can\'t see where it\'s coming from? I\'m in a funny sort of room I can hear this voice saying don\'t be afraid. I don\'t feel afraid anymore. I can still see this green thing but I\'m not afraid anymore of it. I\'m being put on a table. I can move now if I want to, but I don\'t feel frightened any more and there\'s a beam like a pole it\'s above me it\'s moving up toward me. It\'s got a light in it like a fluorescent tube. It\'s coming up from my feet I can hear that voice again saying ""we don\'t mean to harm you and don\'t be afraid."" Makes me feel warm as it moves up me it\'s coming up over my stomach towards my head. Close my eyes I don\'t want to look at it in case it hurts my eyes. It\'s gone! (pause) there is something my nose feels funny (shows movement of nose) that\'s gone as well, I\'m standing up now I don\'t know how I got stood up? I can see a door there is one of these green creatures motioning for me to come with him. Don\'t really want to go with him. I\'d rather stay here I don\'t feel afraid in here (pause).JS- Can you tell me what\'s happening now?Spencer- I\'m walking towards a door there is still a bright light there is light all around want to know where its coming from its just bright all around. Walking down a corridor there is a window. Oh! God!(sounds shocked)is that real? (deep sigh) (pause) (sounds afraid) don\'t want to be up here want to be down there? I can hear that voice again saying you\'ve got nothing to fear. Its pretty though didn\'t realize it looked so pretty. (What Jon was looking at through the window was the earth seen from high in space just like the Apollo astronauts saw. Iv gone past the window now I\'m walking down a corridor. (long pause)JS- What\'s happening now?Spencer- Come to the end of the corridor. There\'s a hole opened in it so I can walk through. I\'m in a big room-a big round room, I\'m on a raised platform against the wall. My camera and compass are trying to get away from me. Going towards the ball. It\'s difficult to pull them back down again, and this balls moved round with strange its got some blocks on it he says we cant stay in here to long he wants us to go out again the holes closed in the wall its gone strange he says I\'ve got nothing to fear but Id still like to go home (pause) its got such big hands.JS- What\'s happening now?Spencer- Going down a corridor again. its very bright still I wish I knew where the light was coming from. And there is another door, going through a door it\'s an empty room two of those green creatures have come with me. there\'s a picture ,it\'s starting to move on the wall wonder how they get the pictures?JS- Can you tell me what\'s happening at this point?Spencer- I\'m looking at the pictures on the wall. (long pause)JS- Pictures on the wall?Spencer- Mmmm. Creatures seem concerned at the damage that its doing. Picture changing now there\'s another picture, another film he\'s asking me a question he says do you understand? I said yes. It\'s time to go. Everything gone black. I\'m walking up the moor again, I\'m walking near some trees. Some movement - I can see something. A green creature. I\'ve shouted to it. It\'s turned round. I don\'t know what it is. I\'ll photograph it it\'s turned around now. It\'s moving quick want to know what it is. I\'m running after it, it\'s gone round a corner, I can\'t see it now. There\'s ... There is a saucer (laughingly), big silver saucer! It\'s disappeared? I\'m walking on down gone past the trees.JS- What\'s happening now?Spencer- I\'m going home. It\'s ten o\'clock on the town hall clock. Can\'t really understand it was only eight o\'clock.JS- You mentioned some green creatures. Would you try to describe them to me?Spencer- It\'s quite small. He\'s got big pointed ears, it\'s got big eyes. They\'re quite dark, he hasn\'t got a nose he\'s only got a little mouth. And his hands are enormous. And his arms are long. He\'s got funny feet.JS- Funny feet?Spencer- They\'re like a V shape like two big toes. Must be difficult to walk like that. He shuffles rather than walks. I don\'t feel afraid of him although he looks odd.JS- You mentioned big hands? Can you say anymore about the hands?Spencer- It\'s got three big fingers, like sausages. Big sausages. They\'re just very big. Bigger than my hands.JS- About how tall would you say these creatures are?Spencer- It\'s about four foot. Comes to the lump on my stomach. He\'s about as high as - just a bit bigger than my stomach is.JS- Okay. Now I wonder if I can ask you another question? you mentioned a film?Spencer- There were two films.JS- Two films?Spencer- One was lots of scenes of destruction like on the news. Can see lots of waste going into the river, and people like Ethiopians who are starving. It\'s not very good, it\'s not very nice.JS- Want to say anything more about that film?Spencer- It\'s much of the same thing, only different.JS- What about the other film then? Do you want to tell me about it?Spencer- I\'m not supposed to.JS- I\'ll leave that up to you entirely, do you want to say anything about that?Spencer- I\'m not supposed to tell anyone about the other film, it\'s not for them to know.JS- Is there any thing more?Spencer- No.As Spencer regained his missing memories, he gave us a fascinating tale of alien abduction. He was taken aboard the craft that he had seen lifting up from the Ilkley Moor. He was given medical-type examinations before being released. He could now remember that it was after his release from the UFO that he took the picture. This one fact would be extremely important:Hough had dealt with a lingering problem with the picture, the time element. Climatic information gathered about the conditions of December 1, 1987, made it almost impossible for Spencer to have taken his picture at the time he had stated. However, and this is extremely important, if the regressive memories are accurate, the conditions would be right to duplicate the lighting conditions of the photograph, which was taken at least an hour after Spencer thought.The witness of a UFO/alien event is as important as the report itself. The case of Ilkley Moor rides high on the character of Spencer. Through the years, Spencer and Hough became good friends, and still see each other from time to time. There has been no change in Spencer\'s account of what he saw that day.He has sought no money from the case, and signed over all copyright privileges to Hough in early 1988. Spencer desires no fame from his account. Is the picture of the Ilkley Moor alien real? There is no way to say. It could be some type of mannequin or doll staged for the photograph, or it could be the picture of the century. Time will be the judge. Until that time, the search for more information continues.author: B. J. Booth', ""1987: Abduction of Jason AndrewsOn A hot, sticky July afternoon in 1987 Jason Andrews is celebrating his fourth birthday at his family's cottage near Slade,  Green in Kent when the heavens open. As the thunder crashes all around, there is a single flash of lightning. Suddenly; a stream of numbers starts pouring out of Jason's mouth: fantastic numbers, complex mathematical equations, even algebra - all from a boy who struggles to count to ten. Seconds later the windows and doors begin to shake violently and the four-year-old announces to his mother, father and elder brother: 'They're waiting for me. I have to go.' Jason's father; Paul, grabs his son and stops him from walking out into the downpour, but the boy struggles violently, and as he does so the house shakes to its very foundations -until, finally, he seems to wake from a trance and the shaking stops. It is the first sign that Jason Andrews is no ordinary little boy and, in the eight years that follow, that is dramatically confirmed. 'It wasn't until 1995, when he was almost 12, that Jason told his astonished parents exactly what had been happening to him - aliens had been abducting him from his bed at night. 'It's always the light that comes first,' he confessed to his mother; Ann. 'Then I see the tall one rise up at the foot of the bed. 'Suddenly there's lots of little ones everywhere. They're fuzzy and indistinct, and they move very fast. I can't move or speak, but I'm awake and I can see and hear and feel. I want to scream and run, but the sound doesn't come out and my body doesn't move. 'I hate them. I hate them,' the boy sobbed. 'I have to go with them. 'They take me to an operating theatre, like at the hospital. It's all white and shiny. Sometimes it's a circular room with a metal floor. It's always cold. 'They're there. The big one touches me but I don't feel it, like as if I've had an anaesthetic.' Then he added poignantly: 'But you don't believe me, you just think I'm making it all up.' In fact, Ann did believe him, and went on to explore the phenomena affecting her son's life in a book, Abducted. This decent, uncomplicated wife and mother came to the conclusion that we may not be alone.Source & References:http://www.fortunecity.com/emachines/e11/86/ufo.html""]"
1953, ,"[' UFO Crash in Arizona, 1953 Though considered a hoax by some UFO investigators, there is an interesting account of a UFO crash that comes to us from Arizona. The facts are certainly worth a look. Famed researcher Raymond Fowler first broke the details of this event of May 20, 1953 in 1973, although it was known to UFO investigator Richard Hall as early as 1964. Fowler stated that his information came from engineer ""Fritz Werner,"" later identified as Arthur G. Stancil. Stancil graduated from Ohio University in 1949 and was first employed by Air Material Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio as a mechanical engineer on testing Air Force aircraft engines. Dr. Eric Wang,  who was suspected of leading a reverse engineering team on alien craft,  headed the Installations Division within the Office of Special Studies where Arthur worked.Stancil signed a legal affidavit vouching to the honesty of his testimony, which was released by Ray Fowler in UFO Magazine, April 1976. He was working for a company that had a government contract at a nuclear site in Nevada. He was summoned by his boss on 5-21-53, and sent on a ""secret"" assignment. After being flown to Phoenix, Arizona, he was placed on a bus with blacked out windows, and taken to a point some four hours drive northwest of the city of Phoenix proper. The location was supposedly near the city of Kingman, Arizona.The bus was full of passengers, none of whom Stancil knew, and would not know, as they were told not to communicate with each other. Arriving at their secret destination, two military light-alls illuminated a surreal scene in the late night, pre-dawn skies of the desert. The engineer was amazed to see a disc-shaped craft embedded into the sand.  Stancil estimated its diameter to be about 30 feet. Military personnel surrounded the aluminum-like craft, which was brought down by either an internal explosion, or was hit by military rockets, Stancil surmised. The wound was easily seen, a gaping hole in its side.Stancil\'s duty was to calculate the speed of the craft, a task he quickly discharged. Afterwards, the tense atmosphere of the group of investigators began to loosen some, and he began to glean details from some of the other personnel assigned to this ""off the record"" mission. He was told of a small cabin inside the craft, and very small chairs. He did not get to look into the unknown craft himself. He was taken back when he peeked into a nearby medical tent. Inside was the small body of a ""creature,"" about 4 foot tall. He asserts that the alien was wearing a type of skull cap, and a silver suit. The suit seemed to be seamless. Soon the investigation was called to a halt, and the members summoned to leave the area. Back on the bus, all of the members of the assignment were ordered to sign the ""official secrets"" act, and were warned not to discuss what they had seen with anyone. Before bringing the crash story to other UFO groups, Fowler did a thorough background check on Stancil, and was satisfied to his authenticity, and personal integrity.Fowler also was persuaded beyond doubt as to the ability of Stancil to do his job, as he came forward with great knowledge of his field and occupation. There was additional confirmation to the validity of the Arizona crash. Personnel at Wright Patterson AFB claimed to have been witness to the delivery from a ""crash site"" in Arizona. These witnesses claimed to have seen ""three small bodies packed in dry ice."" The beings were reported as being about 4 foot tall, with large heads, and brownish skin color. The time of the delivery perfectly coincided with the events put forth by Stancil. Unfortunately, the military personnel could not make their names public. Fowler maintains that several other witnesses have come forward in the years following the incident, but the lack of other facts, and other testimony leave the case lacking somewhat. Possibly one day more evidence will be revealed on this alleged UFO crash in the desert of Arizona.B J BoothSources:Situation RED, by Leo StringfieldUFO Crash at Roswell, by Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt, p.250-251, Avon Books, 1991, ISBN: 0-380-76196-3 UFO: Crash Retrievals, by Jenny Randles, 1995. www.chez.com', 'Early UFO Triangle Report, 1953Fair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

He was in charge of designing the U-2 spy plane for the CIA.On December 16, 1953, a Lockhead WV2 aircraft was being flown by one of Johnson\'s test crews over Long Beach California, at the same time that Johnson and his wife were on the ground in Agoura, California.Johnson, his wife, and the flight crew all spotted a UFO at almost the same time. Because the plane and Johnson\'s location were both known, the location of the unknown object could be triangulated exactly.The object spotted by the observers was a 200 foot long, black craft, similar to the military\'s ""Flying Wing."" The UFO was seen for 6-7 minutes as it hovered over the Santa Barbara Channel.The W-2B decided to get a closer look, and proceeded toward the UFO, which was about 15,000 feet altitude. All the while, Johnson was observing the UFO with his binoculars.He, along with the crew in flight, saw the UFO take off at a great speed. It headed out over the Pacific. It reached 90 miles altitude as it disappeared from view.Later, in Johnson\'s official report, he stated: ""I am now more convinced than ever, that such devices exist, and I have some highly technical converts in this belief.""After looking over the case, the US Air Force concluded that Johnson, his wife, and the airplane crew had seen a lenticular cloud.Although the government thought that Johnson could not tell the difference between a cloud and a structured, flying object, they continued to employ him for many years to come, designing some of the most secretive, cutting-edge planes of his era.']"

1992, ,"['EAST TO WEST UFO SOCIETY - SCOTLANDS LARGEST UFO GROUP 1992THE A70 ABDUCTION CASEThe A70 has been the site of the East 2 West Ufo Society Skywatches for many years now and has a strange mystique all of its own. Below is the complete article by Brian Allan of this famous Scottish incident.The A70 Abduction RevisitedAn P-E-G Case Report© Brian Allan 2000ForwardMy special and unreserved thanks goes to my friend, colleague, and paranormal researcher Malcolm Robinson for supplying invaluable original research material used in this article, particularly a transcript of Colin Wrights original hypnotic regression session.I also wish to express my thanks to Garry Woods for his willingness to be interviewed, recorded and once again relive this remarkable series of events.This particular incident unlike so many others is in some way ‘different’. There is an indefinable sense of ‘rightness’ about it, a feeling that something utterly bizarre and unearthly actually did happen.This case like no other was a catalyst for many people, particularly for those who chose to sit on the fence refusing commitment to the idea of beings from other worlds visiting ours. That the purpose of these visits is totally altruistic is highly debatable, indeed, that the beings are from another world even more so.In this article I will attempt - based on new research into particle physics coupled with a highly controversial psychic experiment - to show that rather than being extraterrestrial, these humanoid creature are extradimensional and exploit this ability at will.Not only that, but governments the world over are aware of this and are attempting to simultaneously co-operate with them and develop our own version of their technology.While I am convinced that this incident did happen, I have written this article primarily in the hope of stimulating debate in the minds of the general public. My research indicates that there other, less well charted regions of human consciousness and by presenting these alternative explanations for what occurred, perhaps I can cast some light into areas that we have previously regarded as magic.The A70 Case RevisitedIn 1992, at around 8pm on a quiet country road on the outskirts of Edinburgh, two ordinary men experienced an extraordinary event that has become enshrined in the annals of Scottish and world UFO mythology. The event, known as the A70 case, was the alleged abduction of the two men by extraterrestrials.Neither of the two men, Garry Wood and Colin Wright, expected anything out of the ordinary to occur when they set out on the fateful night of the 27th of August 1992. Their journey was from the south of Edinburgh on the A70 to the village of Tarbrax in East Lothian, a drive of some 15 miles.The journey, which normally takes around 30 minutes, was in connection with a domestic appliance repair. At around 10 pm they drove through the clear summer’s night at about 40 mph chatting about family and other general issues. Rounding a blind corner, in the vicinity of the Harperrig Reservoir, Colin abruptly leaned forward exclaiming, “What the hell’s that?”Garry peered through the windscreen, there ahead of the car; floating about 20ft above the road was a two-tiered disc-shaped object. He remembers it being about 30 ft wide, wider than the road, smooth, black and shiny with no windows or illumination.Garry, a motor mechanic by trade, is familiar with mechanical devices and a range of metal finishes, found the appearance and finish of the object unusual.Wanting to get away as quickly as possible, he floored the accelerator urging their vehicle up to almost 70 mph. In Colin’s words, Garry was “Driving like a bloody madman.” As they passed below the hovering craft a shimmering curtain of light descended on the car, Garry describes it as like looking at a detuned TV set, just flickering lights. Instantly they were enveloped in total, complete darkness.Later under hypnosis Garry recalled standing (presumably) outside the car, it was still totally and utterly dark, not a hint of light, he could not even see the car; briefly he thought they had crashed and he was dead.He blacked out for what subjectively felt like a few seconds, then abruptly he was awake and the car was veering all over the road. Garry could hear Colin shouting at him to watch out then thankfully, he was able to bring the car to a stop. They looked at each other in disbelief, what had happened?The cool night air was a relief as they gathered their wits. Setting off again, they arrived at their destination still discussing their bizarre encounter.Arriving at Tarbrax they pulled over at their friend’s house, Garry slipped his hand down to free the seat belt: it was already undone.He was briefly puzzled but thought no more of it at that moment. Assuming the time to be around 10.40pm they unloaded the items from the car and carried them to the door of their friends house. They knocked on the door, several minutes went by, then they heard an upstairs window open and their friend’s head emerged. He enquired none to politely just what they were doing and informed them that it was quarter to one in the morning. Naturally they thought he was pulling their legs, but no, he was not, they had ‘lost’ two hours.The men had made the journey to Tarbrax several times and knew it normally took around thirty minutes. Entering the house in a state of some agitation, the men attempted to describe what they had seen; even sketching the craft they had witnessed hovering above the deserted stretch of road.It was well into the small hours when Garry and Colin left for Gilmerton on the outskirts of Edinburgh; not surprisingly they did not return by the same rout and neither man recalls much about the journey.When Malcolm Robinson originally interviewed the householders a few days after the event, they both agreed that Garry and Colin were both clearly agitated and from past experience knew neither man was prone to either lying or dramatics.The following day Garry felt utterly drained of energy, more than just the result of his late night, he felt really worn out. The following few days did not help matters, he was not sleeping at all well, he experienced vivid, disturbing dreams and his sleeping patterns changed for the worse.Eventually consulting his doctor because of severe headaches, he was advised to have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan, this proved negative.As an additional precaution in addition he underwent the uncomfortable procedure of a spinal tap but once again nothing untoward was diagnosed. Fearing ridicule, neither Garry nor Colin reported the incident to the police or media, they did however inform BUFORA (the British UFO Research Association).As a result of the event, Garry became engrossed in UFOlogy in an attempt at understanding what he had experienced. Eventually, heard of SPI and contacted them to arrange a meeting.This was arranged and after two preliminary meetings, Malcolm, SPI’s founder, suggested using the controversial technique of hypnotic regression to access what had occurred during this ‘missing time’. Although Garry and Colin had some misgivings, an initial session was arranged using Scottish hypnotherapist and psychic Helen Walters.During the first session, Garry became very emotional and burst into tears, there was nothing specific, only vague images and impressions, later regression sessions were to prove much more revealing. In later sessions both men remembered sitting in the car, which was stopped in the middle of the road, small humanoid creatures, three to each side, opened both front doors.Colin recalls Garry being placed on a type of stretcher or carrier: none of the entities were supporting it; the ‘stretcher’ was free floating. Garry although he remembers none of this, does recall creatures approaching the car then a searing pain in his abdomen, as if his stomach muscles were being torn apart, as he says, “You know if you’ve been electrocuted, your muscles all cramp up and it’s really painful, you can’t let go, it was like that.”For his part, Colin recalls walking up a ramp into the craft, which was lit by a dazzling white light. He remembers being in a circular corridor being led by one of the creatures. Although some of his recollections are hazy and seem to jump from scene to scene like a series of snapshots he distinctly recalls a room leading from the corridor.The room was utterly featureless except for an unusual chair; it was curiously curved, almost organic in shape. He was stripped naked and placed unresisting in the chair and subjected to some form of non-intrusive physical examination. He also remembers lying back in the chair looking at the ceiling, it was corrugated, translucent, there was soft, diffused lighting filtering through.This memory segued seamlessly into being naked in a transparent container made from a material rather like glass or Perspex; straps at the feet and ankles secured him.Outside the container he could clearly see other men and women, all naked and all in transparent containers like his. Blowing around outside the container was a mist rather like the ‘fog’ created by dry ice for stage and film visual effects. He also saw a number of tall, humanoid creatures, one was standing framed in a doorway opposite him, and another three were approaching the container in which he was imprisoned.Abruptly the transparent material of his container began to frost up, he became alarmed and began to weep, no sooner had he done this than the frosting began to retreat, almost like film sequence running in reverse, until the material was once again perfectly clear. Colin nervously watched as an angular device rose from the floor. It was long and thin, like a rod with a small triangular head; two glowing red lights were set into one of the sides.There was a peculiar appendage about half way along the length of the device and the base was jointed at the floor. The entire machine moved up and down continuously and the appendage swung from left to right; although there was no pain, Colin thought it might be scanning him.After Garry’s initial session his recall improved dramatically. Like Colin he described being in a featureless circular room lying on a flat table, he was unable to move although he does not recall being physically strapped down. He was aware of a black, lens shaped device in the centre of the room, the device was twisting and turning almost as if it were folding in on itself. It reminded Garry of a mobius strip. Although he had no idea of its function he heard it make a ‘whooshing’ noise as if air was being displaced.He had a further impression that the device was ‘tuning’ or stabilising itself. Prior to the steady whooshing sound he had the distinct feeling that the sound emitted by the device was ‘wrong’ and lopsided, almost as if it was in some way out of balance or synchronisation. The even whooshing noise indicated that it was now functioning normally. As he watched the device in fascination he suddenly became aware of a long, thin translucent arm extending over his chest towards his head, the arm abruptly dropped onto his chest near to his shoulder.This particular trauma affected Garry quite powerfully and he jerked out of the hypnotic trance his body convulsing. On another occasion, he remembers a hole forming in the floor; it was filled with a viscous liquid of some kind, like a gel. While he watched this, a small column rose from the floor, Garry described it as resembling a tin can. It continued to rise until it was around three feet above the floor; the device gave out a noise rather like an electric motor and began to rotate slowly. Part of the cylinder rose from the main body and extended towards him until it was level with his eyes.The tip of he extension had two red, glowing dots, at this point Garry noticed the pool of liquid start to vibrate. From the liquid a tall, incredibly thin frail looking creature slowly, almost painfully, emerged. Although bearing a marked similarity to a traditional ‘grey’ it appeared emaciated, like a skeleton covered in skin. He remembers that the skin over its ribs looked discoloured and bruised.He later discovered that all the creatures had difficulty with the gravity and atmospheric pressure on, particularly the tall, thin translucent creatures that frequently tended to fall over. It was his impression that due to the bruised appearance of the creatures, the pool of gel was some form of therapeutic agent designed to treat the damage caused by their frequent falls. Bizarrely, he also recalled a small man apparently quite human dressed in a neat black suit complete with collar and tie who was watching the proceedings. He was standing among the entities all of which seemed quite deferential towards him.alien depictionIn all, Wood remembers there being around 20 or 30 creatures present, the majority tall, a pallid grey colour and frail looking. One notable variation from this was a smaller, rather bizarre looking being with an odd heart shaped face. On its face were some strangely familiar markings, these comprised coloured facial stripes, three, diagonally on each cheek.These were reminiscent of the tribal markings normally associated with members of the Native American tribes. He looked at the creatures and mentally ‘asked’, “Why are you doing this”.The answer that appeared in his mind was surprising and not a little disturbing, one word: “Sanctuary”. While he was in telepathic communication with the creature he was able to ‘see’ fragments of its existence as if the process was a two way street, the creature found this amusing but could not prevent it.In a further mental communication the being ‘said,’ “In many was you are more advanced than us but you have been ‘capped’. Our existence is much like your own, we also have concerns and needs”.Just what ‘capped’ means is open to question, but it is quite given what had already been communicated that the inference was, our development either psychological, physical or both, has been deliberately slowed down. Were we likely to present a threat to someone or were we perhaps too immature to deal with the responsibility that our development would bring? Rather like handing a child a loaded gun…perhaps.Garry is certain that at one point they were taken underground; from the table where he lay, he could see tunnels leading off from a huge, central chamber hewn form solid rock, there was also an enormous machine close to him, possibly it was another flying machine like the one he had witnessed above the road Perhaps Gary’s most worrying memory was seeing a young woman seated naked on the floor, facing the wall; one of the tall creatures was standing beside her.As Gary looked at her she turned her head towards him; her hair was in a loose shaggy perm with blond highlights. She was sitting shivering with her knees drawn up to her chin, her arms were wrapped around her knees cradling herself, she had been crying and was clearly in the same predicament as him. He is convinced that should they meet again he would recognise her instantly.It should be stressed that Gary is totally sincere in his belief and his sincerity shows, he certainly does not give the impression that he concocted the whole thing.Following the alleged abduction and subsequent regressions, Gary and Colin dealt with their ordeal in different ways; Gary became deeply involved in the study of UFO’s and the paranormal to the extent of setting up his own research group.On occasions he has collaborated with another Scottish researcher, Ron Halliday. Colin on the other hand went in the other direction entirely and has effectively rejected the event and refuses to discuss the matter, but given the trauma associated with the incident this reaction is not totally unexpected.The Hypnotic RegressionWhat follows is a transcript of a session in an A70 related typical hypnotic regression supervised and conducted by Helen Walters:Helen: “I want you to relive that night Colin, see it, feel it where are you?”Colin: “Nowhere”.Helen: “Where is nowhere”. Colin: “Just nowhere, complete blackness”.Helen: “What are you looking at, what are you trying to see?”Colin: “I feel I’m going up”.Helen: “Going up?”Colin: “Uh huh”.Helen: “See it, feel it, can you hear anything”?Colin: “Nothing” Helen: “See it Colin, nothing can harm you at this moment, listen to the sound of my voice”, Colin’s body jerked suddenly.Colin: “ Creatures, I’m telling them to get lost”.Helen: “Where are you”?Colin: “I’m in a Bright room”.Helen: “What are they doing”?Colin: “They’re trying to undress me”.Helen: “Tell me what’s happening Colin”.Colin: “I’m sitting with no clothes on”.Helen: “Where are you sitting”?Colin: “A metal chair, it’s smooth and cold”.Helen: “How do you feel”?Colin: “Just cold”.Helen: “Tell me what is happening Colin”?Colin: “Something’s in my right eye”.Helen: “What’s in your right eye”?Colin: “I don’t know, it’s uncomfortable, like a red hot poker in the centre of my eye, it’s really sore”.Helen: “Who is putting this hot poker I to your eye”?Colin: “I can’t see anything”.Helen: “Is your left eye open”?Colin: “Uh huh”Helen: “Why are you shaking your head”? At this point Colin was moving his head from side to side.Colin: “I’m trying to get a good look at the thing, the thing that’s doing this to me to me”. Helen: “What’s Happening now”?Colin: “Just took it out of my eye, my right eye’s really burning, my eye’s really watering, it’s gushing”.Helen; “What kind of material was it, what did it feel like”?Colin; “It felt like there was something clamped on it, that there was something going into my eye”.Helen: “How did you get there Colin, how did you get there? I want you to relive your journey”Colin: “The car is in a big, bright, metallic room”.Helen: “How did it get there”?Colin: “It was lifted”.Helen: “How was it lifted”?Colin: “I don’t know, I just feel it juddering and being lifted”.Helen: “OK, go back to the beginning of your journey”.Colin: “Just passing the reservoir on the left hand side, just passing the farmhouse on the right. Doesn’t make sense, there’s no road, nothing; the car is definitely off it. There seems to be some kind of force, there is nothing physical that I can see. I’m cold; I’m getting carried along at some rate”. Colin’s body gave a powerful twitch. “I’m in that chair again…something’s looking at me back in the corridor, it’s…it was…ahhh…it’s ugly”.Helen: “Describe it Colin, describe the ugly thing”.Colin: “It’s ugly and it’s lurking in that corridor, it comes and goes, it seems ancient to me. Ugly…it’s really badly deformed, I’m not scared of it any more”. Colin began to laugh. “It seems that this thing has been in a fight and it’s the loser. I think it’s trying to manipulate me”.Helen: “In what way”?Colin: “I don’t know, ii think I’m pissing it off because I’m not scared any more. I’m laughing at it, it’s weird it’s away”. Colin’s head turned to the right. “ I can hear a noise behind me, I can’t think of a word to describe it”. His body convulsed briefly. “I’m staring at a wee one”.Helen: “A wee what”?Colin: “ A wee creature, it’s not very happy with me, I don’t think I was supposed to look behind my chair for some reason. It’s looking at me with those black eyes but I’ll not give in”. Helen: “You won’t give in to what”?Colin: “It’s trying to outstare me. It’s away; I don’t think it was very pleased with me. It just doesn’t want me to see what is behind me for some reason. If I try to do anything they’ll come round the corner and stop me”.Helen: “What do you have on Colin”?Colin: “Nothing, the chair is freezing, I keep wanting to get out of the chair but I bet it will be a big mistake”.Helen: “Did they speak to you”?Colin: “No, but I could tell it was pissed off. I’m looking at something, it looks like some sort of surgery tool, I think that’s what went into my eye”.Helen: “Can you describe it”?Colin: “It sort of comes down and bends to the left and then bends down again, it’s hard to describe. I’ve never see anything like it, it separates into four and there’s all just things hanging from it”.Helen: “Move on from there Colin”. He convulsed again. “What’s happening Colin”?Colin: “Two of them have got me by the feet and are dragging me toward a small archway”.Helen “How did you get out of the chair”? Colin: “They grabbed me by the feet, I think I pushed them off”.Helen: “What’s happening now”?Colin: “They’re dragging me back to the car, they’re not fussy about hurting me”. More convulsionsHelen: “Where are you now”?Colin: “Back in the car, back in the seat”.Helen: “Do you have your clothes on”?Colin: “Yes”.Helen: “Go back to when you put your clothes on, what’s happening”?Colin: “Putting my clothes on”.Helen: “Who”?Colin: “The wee aliens”.Helen: “How many are there”?Colin: “Four”. Again more convulsions. “There is a big alien in front of me doing something, my head is pounding. I don’t know if it’s giving me something or taking something out of my head. My mind goes black, then lighter, my head feels numb, it feels massive, it feels as if I’ve got a big forehead”. Colin’s hand came up and he rubbed forehead vigorously”Helen: “What’s happening”?Colin: “Shooting pain, I don’t know what they have done but it’s weird, my brain feels like it’s swollen and pushing my head out like it’s going to burst. I can’t handle this, it’s stopped, it’s weird”.Helen: “Can you move on, where are you now”?Colin: “Back on the road”.Helen: “How did you get there”?Colin: “Big bang then a thud”.Helen: “Anyone in the car with you”?Colin: “Gary’s looking at m, he’s bewildered, Garry’s asking me, did you see what I saw”?Helen: “ Did you see Garry on your travels”?Colin: “No, just now”.UFO As part of a recent BBC TV programme, Garry agreed to undergo a polygraph (lie detector) test supervised by Bud Hopkins an American UFO abduction guru and Professor Susan Greenwood a lecturer in psychology and presenter of ‘Brain Story’, a BBC series dealing with perception. While he was attached to the machine Prof. Greenwood asked Garry a series of leading question: he passed the test.Although this does not mean that he was actually abducted by alien beings, is does indicate that he believes something highly unusual occurred. It must be stressed that the use of polygraphs is a controversial issue, almost as much as hypnotic regression.It is claimed that the machine can be duped into accepting a response to a question as the truth when it is not. In the A70 incident this is entirely justified because there is one overall flaw in the evidence presented: the hypnotic regressions.A period of almost six months elapsed between the incident and the regressions, six months in which both men, because they were not conversant with the subject of UFO’s and UFOlogy, read all they could about the subject and the mythology surrounding the it, particularly Garry.This alone must render the disclosures as presented under regression unreliable, add to this the predisposition for the typical hypnotic subject to please the questioner by saying what is expected of them and the evidence begins to fall apart. Without these crucial statements what is left is the undeniable conviction of both men that a real event took place, an event that they cannot otherwise explain.The machines currently in use today by various agencies are variations on a design devised in 1945 by John Edward Reid an American criminologist. All the devices rely on involuntary responses (emotional stress) generated by the body in response to direct questions, i.e. when telling a lie, in a normal person, breathing and blood pressure alter as does the galvanic response of the skin.Before the session begins the operator asks questions designed to act as a base line response and calibrates the machine accordingly, in other words he or she asks the subject to deliberately tell a lie. The machine however is not foolproof and various physiological elements can render the findings at best doubtful and at worst totally invalid. Examples of this are nervousness and mental disorders; likewise if the subject is a pathological liar then they will generate no change whatsoever in stress patterns when lying.Although widely used as an adjunct to criminal investigations, due to possible variations in response, evidence gathered from polygraph tests are not legally admissible as evidence. This is in no way intended to detract from Gary’s evidence or insinuate in any way that he fooled the machine, but merely to illustrate that polygraph derived testimony is not infallible.The AlternativesThese then are the bare bones of the account, at the time no serious attempt was made to present the events in terms other than an extraterrestrial encounter. There are other equally valid explanations for what did or did not occur and none of them directly employ the ETH (Extraterrestrial Hypothesis) theory.The bottom line is: ‘something’ happened! Something so traumatic that both men unconsciously rationalised their experience in the only way that made sense to them, an alien abduction. The list of possibilities therefore include,The events are a total fabrication or,This was an actual alien abduction, or,A MILAB, (Military Abduction) or,An encounter with a powerful EM (electromagnetic) anomaly, orA ‘time or dimension slip’, in other words a rip in the fabric of space / time.The first of the possibilities, a fabrication, is very unlikely, neither man wanted or needed the notoriety such a claim would bring both to themselves and indirectly their families. Neither was there a likelihood of any financial reward, the obvious sincerity of the men, the subsequent hypnotic regressions and recent polygraph test also serves to rule out a deliberate and premeditated lie as a possibility.The second, extraterrestrial intervention while possible is in the light of the other options less likely than it was previously. Certainly the incident bears all the hallmarks of many classic abduction cases and in common with these it contains a wealth of detail, the electrical malfunction of the car, the incongruous mist, humanoid ‘greys’ and other creatures, the medical examinations, the (possible) implants etc. etc.To be really effective though, one must first embrace the ETH as a reality to the exclusion of all the other possible explanations. While there are tens of thousands of people can and do accept this as a premise, there are equally tens of thousands more who do not.The next alternative to alien abduction is a ‘MILAB’; this hypothesis while still remarkable is considerably more likely than the purely alien alternative. It is in many ways equally worrying, not least because the protagonists are not necessarily operating with the consent or authority of the British Government and are almost certainly working to their own, quite separate agenda, the potential for a political and military disaster is enormous.The likelihood of governments to target their own people for experimentation is far from unique; there are several instances where certain covert agencies in the United States, the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) and the NSA (National Security Agency) are typical examples, have perpetrated disgraceful covert experiments on specific ‘target’ groups of the American people.This was particularly true of experiments relating to experimental nerve agents designed for biological warfare, the prolonged effects of exposure to microwave radiation and cynical attempts to influence how people think using ‘psychotronic’ devices developed under ‘black’ projects ranging from Project Artichoke (originally sanctioned by former CIA chief Allen Dulles) to project MK-ULTRA which was officially terminated in the early 1970’s. Not surprisingly, this official termination did not end the project, for from it. This along with other covert enterprises, most notably the ill conceived ‘star wars’ project went ‘black’ and disappeared completely into the shadowy maze of the government / military /industrial complex.The manipulation of the ETH for government / military ends is both practical and logical, it is also likely that governments can and do set up ‘extraterrestrial’ close encounter incidents for their own ends, they have the funding, resources and technology to do so.This is of course, only a smokescreen to disguise possible inadvertent sightings during tests of their own experiments involving cutting edge, experimental military hardware. Perhaps to demonstrate some feigned interest, the police and media sidetrack and pay lip service to any reports made by the general public then quickly forget about it.What happened to Gary and Colin could easily fall under the heading of a classic MILAB scenario. In Scotland (and elsewhere) there are persistent rumours and sightings of large, totally silent triangular aircraft that have the uncanny ability to hover noiselessly one second then instantaneously accelerate away at remarkable velocities the next making no sound except a rush of air to mark their departure.There are also leaked stories of microwave inspired devices and machines designed to paralyse the human nervous system and render the affected person unconscious. These devices are used in covert mind control projects pioneered under the previously mentioned ‘MK-ULTRA’ using ‘psychotronic transmitters’.Psychotronics were developed by intelligence agencies in both of the superpowers based on earlier, less reliable methods. The US originally attempted mind control using ‘narcohypnosis’, a technique employing certain hallucinogenic drugs, hypnosis and altered states of consciousness. Early forms of mind control employed by the former Soviet Union are less clearly defined due to the obsessive secrecy employed by the communist regime in power at the time.This policy was obviously re-enforced by the minimal civil rights implemented by the then Russian totalitarian state. Nonetheless, the former USSR did have programmes designed to investigate and develop possible methods of mind control, there can be little doubt that in many ways they emulated American techniques. For both powers, testing these methods in-house on ‘volunteers’ from the armed forces is one thing, but for various reasons, probably psychological, tests on selected unsuspecting members of the general public, the abductees, may be more valid due to the trauma experienced.The means and will to perpetrate MILABS are in place and the desire to use them as a research tool is likewise present. The techniques employed to convince the unfortunate abductees rely on conscious altering techniques, chemicals, well-understood processes within the human brain and probably bio-electronic implants.Everyone’s brain is ‘hard wired’ in a similar fashion and if a given input is applied, the brain will respond in a fairly predictable manner and produce the desired images, memories and impressions.It is quite possible that repeat abductees are monitored on a regular basis to assess how well the experiment /implant /programming is progressing, and as a result experience abductions regularly.Another factor tying this to the A70 case is the appearance of a human being, the man wearing a black suit, this is common in many reported a MILAB’s. Not necessarily a man wearing a suit, but the presence of human beings interspersed with the aliens, humans who appear to be either in control of the proceedings or immune from them. It should be borne in mind that this incident and the regressions occurred years before the SF film ‘Men In Black’ was made.The shared mythology of grim faced, rather threatening Men in Black and UFO’s has been linked to sightings in various countries around the world. According to all reports, they always appear unannounced at the home of people who have had a UFO experience, particularly if the person involved managed to get a really good view of one of the objects and /or its occupants.Once they arrive, they make it abundantly clear through either thinly veiled threats or appeals to the person’s sense of national loyalty, usually both, that the person should forget the incident, or their (the MIB’s) appearance ever took place. MIB’s are also recorded as a facet of UFO sightings, but normally they appear to threaten /cajole after the incident, it is most unusual for them to be observed during the actual abduction.The third option, an encounter with an EM field, is much more complex and subtle, not least due to the subjective impressions of the experiencers. In the A70 incident there are a number of factors to be taken into account. First, the source of natural EM fields, the area of the abduction is close to a natural geological fault in the Pentland Hills, which is an excellent source of EM radiation.If the tectonic plates flex or twist as a result of a micro-tremor a powerful discharge is created and pulsed to the surface. Next, the proximity of the Harperrig Reservoir; due to their ionising properties reservoirs and other stretches of water are another major factor in EM induced hallucinations. This gives rise to two possible scenarios, both based on the premise that the men and their vehicle had passed through such an EM field on the road to Tarbrax.The least likely of these two scenarios would involve both of the men being rendered unconscious, the car electrics malfunctioning and the vehicle stopping. Some time elapses and the men regain consciousness, the car engine restarts and they proceed and discover they have ‘lost’ two hours. For various reasons, not least the presence of other traffic, this is impractical, although the fact that the engine spontaneously restarts introduces another factor into the equation and it is a puzzle that is worth examining.If the engine restarts because the ignition key is turned by one of the car’s occupants, then this at least makes sense, but if it just abruptly begins running without the aid of a starter, then this is something quite different. In fact, as we shall see, when we consider the possibilities opened up by quantum physics, this introduces factors involving time and the ability to halt it, because if the engine was somehow halted in mid cycle then this would go some way to explaining other phenomena reported by abductees.The second and much more conventional explanation is; when they entered the magnetic field they suffered a paroxysm or epileptoform seizure, these could well be subclinical (i.e. not requiring medical treatment), temporal micro-seizures but in effect caused the men to perform and function as if on autopilot. These micro-seizures interfere with the consolidation of incoming information to the brain.‘The condition causes electrical spikes and transients in the brain, leading to sudden tingling in digits, fingers and nose, flashes of light – hallucinations - coloured balls of light etc. Hearing sounds, ringing, buzzing, hearing ones name being called. Strange intense smells, pleasant and unpleasant and dizziness with no obvious cause’. [J Gilroy - Basic Neurology - Pergammon Press 1973]. In this scenario they could drive around for some time totally unaware of their surroundings, or conversely, Gary may have parked the vehicle and they just sat there. When the effects wore off, Gary restarted the car and resumed the journey coming fully awake seconds after setting off and causing the car to swerve violently, although seemingly unlikely this scenario is not unique and is medically possible.The same or similar experiences have also been reported by persons suffering for the onset of migraines or migraines at (once again) sub-clinical levels (Gary’s severe headache), the effects of this include:Noises, ‘hisses and rumbling, intense smells’, [extracted from ‘Migraine’ by Oliver Sacks pub. Picador 1973] Enhancement of Visual Threshold i.e.’ bright lights and increased illumination’Sonic Enhancement; ‘faint sounds are unusually enhanced and thus misinterpreted’, Mosaic Vision; normal images become progressively degraded from normal through crystalline and iridescent, to grainy and almost cubist,Still Vision; a rapid flicker of still images like a film run very slowly, at 6–12Hz. Or ‘no life’ all is still and dead, time is ‘fractured’, this is known as ‘Cinematic Vision’ to neurologists.Lilliputian Hallucinations; e.g. a male 38 years old reported seeing small grey humanoids crowding into his room. He was not afraid because they ignored him. Such hallucinations are typically followed by feelings of curiosity or amusement. Elementary Hallucinations include; blobs of light, stars and complex geometrical shapes. The electrical malfunctions lodge in the lower cortex, and visual and tactile regions of the sensory cortex, the condition can last for half an hour. Another effect created by this condition is of a blinding light, which moves outward across the visual field and can last for 20 minutes’.The effects of EM fields on areas of the brain and particularly with people who are EH (Electrically Hypersensitive) can and does cause all manner of unusual and undesirable neurological and physiological symptoms including, ‘visions, hallucinations, fear, anxiety, being OOB (out of body), unconsciousness, feelings of being touched and watched etc’.This therefore demonstrates how external EM stimuli can and does affect the normal operation of the human brain by interfering with inherent bioelectrical processes within specific areas of the brain cortex.The fourth and last possibility, that of experiencing a dimensional slip, although at first sight a complete outsider, is, when examined closely and current research into ‘string theory’ is taken into account suddenly becomes a distinct possibility, even a probability. Although theoretically possible in terms of quantum mechanics it was not until a recent unconnected series of amateur experiments revealed the distinct possibility of such contact.The theory is based on parallel universes and dimensions existing alongside our own, normally invisible and inaccessible, but during specific sets of circumstances the two interface with one another and a point of contact is established allowing transfer between the two realities.‘Our universe seems to have four dimensions: three of space (up-down, left-right, forward-backward) and one of time. Although we can barely imagine extra dimensions, mathematicians and physicists have long analysed the properties of theoretical spaces that hare any number of dimensions’ [Graham P Collins, staff writer on ‘The Universes Unseen Dimension’, ‘Scientific American’ Aug 2000].‘Amazingly, in the past two years physicists have begun seriously examining the idea: that everything we can see in our universe is confined to a three dimensional ‘membrane’ that lies within a higher dimensional realm. The physicists may soon be able to detect and verify the existence of reality’s extra dimensions, which could extend over distances as large as a millimetre. Experiments are already looking for the extra dimensions effect on gravity.If the theory is correct, up-coming high-energy experiments in Europe could see unusual processes involving quantum gravity, such as the creation of transitory minute ‘black holes’. The theory is based on some of the most recent developments in string theory and would solve some long-standing puzzles of particle physics and cosmology’. [Nima Arkani-Hamed, Savas Dimopoulos and George Dvali, The Universes Unseen Dimensions, Scientific American Aug 2000].The exotic concept of ‘string theory’ and multidimensions actually arise from attempts to understand the most familiar of forces: gravity. More than three centuries after Sir Isaac Newton proposed his law of gravitation, physics still does not explain why gravity is so much weaker than all the other forces’.The ‘strings’ and ‘superstrings’ mentioned in these quotes are at the heart of this revolutionary concept. In particle physics, at the very core of the atom, along with the neutrons, protons, leptons and quarks etc there are ‘strings’, sometimes called ‘superstrings’.During experiments using particle accelerators, physicists noticed that one particular class of sub-atomic particle, the quark, never appear singly, but invariably in groups of two and three. Sometimes they are in a row and on other occasions turn in on themselves to form loops. These loops and rows vibrate at different frequencies. To give an idea of the scale: a string is to an atom as an atom is to the universe.‘They are the basis of all matter, but the mathematics of superstrings gives nonsense answers unless space contains some extra dimensions beyond the usual three, or four including time. These extra dimensions were believed to be too tiny to worry about, smaller than a virus to the same degree as an ant is smaller than the universe.Any motion in an extra dimension would return to its staring point in too short a time to be measured. Experiments designed to detect such tiny dimensions would require energy far exceeding that available in the most powerful currently available atom smashers.In 1996, Dr Joseph Lykken of the Fermi National Accelerator in Batavia, Illinois, USA suggested that superstrings might have affects detectable at much lower energies. If so, other physicists calculated last year (1998), the hidden superstring dimensions could be bigger than originally thought. In fact hidden dimensions could be as much as the size of a small ant – about 1mm across.Hardly huge you will agree, and there is a universe in there. But the visible universe is huge only in the familiar three dimensions of space. In additional dimensions the universe would be thin, the way a sheet of paper is thick in two dimensions and thin in another.In the hidden dimensions the visible universe’s thickness would measure on the order of one ten millionth of a billionth of a millimetre.So countless such universes could fit in the extra dimensions. According to Dr Lykken, “The specific laws of physics would be different in each of these universes or ‘branes’ (membranes), Their law of gravity would be the same as ours, but everything else would be different… but maybe they could form galaxies stars galaxies and planets” such parallel 3-D universes, or three-branes might contain unusual forms of matter, possibly forming stars, planets and strange people – all less than a millimetre from the home brane of the sun There’s no danger of bumping into alien universes however.Nobody can reach out and touch, or see, or send laser beams carrying messages to parallel braneworlds because light and matter are confined to each brane. “We are built of particles that cannot fall off and probe the extra dimensions,” said physicist, professor Dr Nemanja Kaloper of Stanford University’. [Tom Sigfried, (science writer) Dallas Morning Post, 5th July 1999]The really bizarre thing about them is their properties. In other words, sometimes they are there and sometimes not, so, where do they go? Physicists have calculated that they enter a different state of existence in effect another dimension.Thus far, using string theory equations they have located the existence nine possible dimensions but can only rationalise five of them.Another explanation for parallel universes is based on the concept of ‘dark matter’ ‘Another example is the mystery in cosmology of what constitutes ‘dark matter’ the invisible gravitating substance than seems to make up 90% of the mass of the universe. This dark matter may reside in parallel universes.Such matter would affect our universe through gravity and is necessarily ‘dark’ because out species of is stuck to our membrane, so photons cannon travel across the void from the parallel matter to our eyes’ [Nima Arkani-Hamed, Savas Dimopoulos and George Dvali, The Universes Unseen Dimensions, Scientific American Aug 2000].In other words, the parallel universes and dimensions may coexist with our own but are invisible to us by nature of a) their structure and b) the frequency at which they function. This leads to the theory that ‘extraterrestrials’ are in fact ‘extradimensionals’, perhaps even reflections of us existing in a separate dimension. They glimpses we occasionally have of them are distorted by probable temporal difference between the two realities.In this scenario the EM field may have created the portal and Gary and Colin either ‘fell through’, or the entities used or created a weakness in space /time to travel from their dimension. In this instance time would have no meaning at all, in effect the two men were in limbo until either rejected by the other dimensions, a reflex action as instinctive and involuntary as the human body rejects a virus, or, deliberately sent back into this time frame.Whether the visions both men recalled under hypnosis were memories of the beings inhabiting these alternate dimensions or fantasies culled from their subconscious is at the very core of this debate.It has been suggested by various groups of researchers that the entities described by both men during the regressions are in fact denizens of these alternate dimensions.This falls into line with the train of thought that UFOs and their occupants are a trans-dimensional phenomena rather than an extraterrestrial one. These concepts are based on how some UFO’s act and perform when observed, i.e. instantaneous movement, vanishing and re-appearing in the blink of an eye etc. In fact both of these explanations may contain part of the answer; it has been claimed recently by an amateur research body, ‘The Scole Group’ that under certain circumstances it is possible to forge a link between the two (or more) dimensions.During their five-year project, the Scole Group using mediums and psychics claim to achieve contact with discarnate intelligences from the ‘other side’, the ‘spirit world’ or for this propose, another dimension. Whether one accepts the reality and conclusions of these findings, some of the results do deserve close attention particularly in relation to the appearance of one of these entities.Once the mystical trappings are swept away, what one of their experiments using video cameras and a device called a ‘double psychomanteum’, revealed the image of a being the group decided to call ‘Blue’. (A ‘psychomanteum’ is an arrangement of mirrors or other reflective polished surfaces e.g. copper or brass).Those attempting to either communicate with the dead or consult oracles have used this system for centuries, the user sits gazing into the mirror and according to the theory, the image of the spirit /oracle appears. Because of the mirrors, they dubbed this experiment ‘Project Alice’. ‘Gradually the line turned sideways and the square screen came into view, now seen from the front.The amazing thing was that as the screen rotated it had an image on it. This was a very clear view of an ‘animated interdimensional friend’ whose features, to say the least were not exactly our own. This friend has been named ‘Blue’. We leave you to decode whether the image is thought provoking. The group has no doubts.For them this was a fantastic result, which has been achieved, in fully lighted conditions’ [‘The Scole Experiment’, pp138 Grant and Jane Solomon pub Piatkus 2000].‘Further experiments did produce an array of images. There were things that looked like shrimps, an orange and yellow flower unfolding, a comet, eyes, lips even a beak. Another image resembled a rotating doorway’ Whether one accepts the validity of this type of phenomenon is entirely subjective, however, in this instance a video camera was mounted to replace the human being and allowed to record any images that appeared in the mirror.On this occasion ‘Blue’ appeared, during other sessions recorded a few days later, pinkish images of what may be planets suspended in space and pyramid shaped objects were captured on tape.All very good except for one item: ‘Blue’. The entity which the group rather ingenuously named ‘Blue’ is to all intents and purposes a ‘Grey’, the ubiquitous occupant /pilot of UFO’s. The similarity is quite obvious, the elongated face, large, black, slanted eyes no discernable mouth or nose, the likeness is unmistakable. What then did the Scole Group record, the inhabitant of another reality/galaxy/dimension or an extraterrestrial?If they did achieve an astonishing breakthrough then perhaps this is proof that other dimensions actually exist alongside our own and are accessible. The basis for their experiments was the intention to demonstrate scientific proof of an afterlife, it would be foolish to dismiss the project out of hand as superstitious nonsense, this is akin to ‘throwing the baby out with the bathwater’. Irrespective of their motives, if the video images captured by the group are of an interdimensional entity then it is feasible that Garry and Colin actually did find themselves, briefly, literally ‘out of this world’ in circumstances generated by the deliberate manipulation of space /time.This concept also throws the standard idea of interstellar and intergalactic travel by means of ‘nuts and bolts’ vehicles into disarray and leads to other questions, i.e. are all genuine anomalous sightings recorded in the skies and on the surface of planet Earth the result of interdimensional visitations, or does the method of ‘travel’ involve dipping into an alternate universe.One of the theoretical methods of transport involves literally taking two points in space and drawing then together, actually folding space and passing directly across between the two folded sections. In effect what was described in Frank Herbert’s classic book ‘Dune’ as “The art of travelling without moving”.Or in line with contemporary theorising are controlled miniature black holes being used to punch holes in the very fabric of reality as we comprehend it and permit interdimensional travel?It is therefore quite possible that in physical terms, the ‘UFO’ (if that is what it was) never actually moved from the spot where Garry and Colin were abducted, instead it merely ‘phased’ itself out from our point in relative space/time into one of its own choosing. Correspondingly, their return, along with that of their car, was achieved by ‘phasing’ back into our continuum and releasing them, truly, the art of travelling without moving.FootnoteWhat follows is a verbatim account from a recorded interview made on the Sunday the 25th of October 2000 between Garry Woods, my colleague Bill Devlin and myself. NB This interview was not conducted under hypnosis.Assuming the results of the Scole experiments to be genuine, and the findings of particle physicists based in solid foundations, then the practise of spiritualism takes on a fresh and quite unexpected look. The prayers used in traditional spiritualism date from the 1950’s when, in order to deflect charges of witchcraft and sequent prosecution under arcane legislation, prayers were incorporated into services.The actual prayers are unnecessary as are invocations of God’s blessing; the real miracle lies in the talents of the mediums who produce the effects. Whether they believe that their talent comes from above is neither here nor there, all that matters is that it works. It is therefore possible that to produce these effects, mediums are capable of retuning or realigning their minds to a different frequency and cutting between the dimensions to make contact with… something, acting as conduits for two-way communication. There is no reason that, once the mechanics of this are understood, devices could not be developed to facilitate this communication and even permit transportation.The car driven by Garry on the night of the event car, the silent witness in this affair also was adversely affected by what transpired, I asked him about this and other matters raised in the interview.BA: “ I know you must be pissed off with the constant questions over the years, them and the same answers, but if possible could you try to forget it and pretend it’s the first time you’ve discussed this with anyone, will you try this”?Garry: “Aye ok”.BA: “How did you deal with the after effects of the incident”?Garry: “After what happened, Colin and I went back looking in the area and found stuff that had been in the car, dusters, rags and bits and pieces, as if someone had been raking around in the car. After this my car started growing a white ‘foost’, [a vernacular expression for fungus or dust] all over it. (The car was an almost new Vauxhall Astra).You know the kind of thing that develops on battery terminals, like crystallisation, but all over the car. I was always at the car removing this growth, rubbing down the paintwork and repainting it. I couldn’t understand it. I know cars, it’s my job, I’m an ambulance mechanic. I thought maybe it’s a bad earth, so I changed the earths but it made no difference. I tried everything but it made no difference, inside the boot, it was everywhere, this white crystallisation”.Garry also mentioned a dream experienced by both men,Garry: “I spoke with Colin at great length, talking even before we talked to Malcolm (Robinson), the only thing we had in common was, like, we both sort of had a dream, I don’t know, like we were away for ten years, and we came back and our family had all changed and everything like that. I know this sounds a bit…daft, but that’s kind of like the way that he thought and I thought”.BA: “Did you actually dream this while actually asleep or was it a general feeling”?Garry: “ No, it was just a feeling, really odd, a feeling”.BA: “How did Colin deal with the situation”?Garry: “Well, Colin at first was interested in it, talked to a few neighbours and so on, then he said he didn’t want to carry on with it, he knew what he saw and now he wanted to get on with his life. I tried to give him books on it but he said he didn’t want to go into it any more, but if I found out anything to let him know. He still come and sees me, we’re still mates”.BA: “Do you think Colin be prepared to talk about it”?Garry: “Yes, probably, I could ask him for you if you want”.BA: “Fine that would be fine, Garry, about the girl you saw in the craft, what about her, what became of her, did you see her again”.Garry: “I don’t know how this must sound, but all I could think of was getting out of there. I wasn’t interested in her, I didn’t care what happened to her, all I could think about was me, I wasn’t thinking how could I help her, all I was bothering about was me. I would have murdered, killed, anything to get away from there, I just wanted away”BA: “The hypnosis sessions, did the information come directly from the hypnosis or immediately after”?Garry: “Yeah, aye, ahha, Colin would talk under hypnosis, I wasn’t as good a subject, I seemed to find it more difficult”.BA: “The actual experiences of being underground, OK, obviously I wasn’t privy to the original sessions, why do you think you were underground”?Garry: “The things I saw underground, I saw a big craft in a big, huge open space under the ground.BA: “: Was it the same as the craft you’d seen”?Garry: “Ummm, it’s very vague in my mind and it was just like tunnels, dark tunnels”.BA: “It’s possible that this underground situation might not necessarily be on earth…it could have been anywhere…off this planet…could have been somewhere entirely different”Garry, “Well, the creatures I saw…I saw different things, the thing I remember is a being, right in my face. It said to me, I’ve got a life, a life like yours but different, things happen to us, but what’s got to be done’s got to be done”.BA: “Did they ever tell you why they were doing what they were doing”?Garry: Well, ah, it asked me for something and I was crying, I said, I can’t help you I’ve got a wife and children and this and that, and what it said it wanted was sanctuary”.BA: That was in some of the stuff I got from Malcolm, yes, sanctuary. When they asked for sanctuary did they think that you…that we could supply this sanctuary”?Garry: “I don’t know…ummm, it’s all…it said, your not living like you should be living, that’s what it told me, you’re not living like you should be living”’BA: “Did it elaborate on that”?Garry: “It said we were more advanced than them, it what way I don’t know, it said something about we were all capped, in what way I don’t know”.BA: “Capped, as in stopped from developing”?Garry: “Capped, I don’t know. They had a lot of trouble with the pressure because the big ones kept falling over but the wee ones weren’t”.BA: “Like the gravity was too intense for them”?Garry: “Like heavy pressure on them, they couldn’t handle it”.BA: “Yes, ok”.Garry: “Like pressure, I was two objects going away from my chest, just two objects going away…up in the…”.BA: “You were lying down at this time”?Garry: “ Aye, I was lying down and I saw two objects getting lifted away, physical objects lifted away. They turned me round, moved me, they were interested in my left leg. What it was, it sounds daft but these things were happy to see me, it was like they were glad, I don’t know but that’s what it seemed like”BA: “Did they hurt you, do you think they went out of their way to hurt you or it was just incidental to what they were doing”?Garry: “Between me and you I wasn’t terrible worried, I used to run out of my bed screaming at night, you can ask my wife.BA: “ Was this prior to this or after”?Garry: “After, it happened, I would get out of bed screaming at night, I would run out of the house, I would hug the covers. Kim [Garry’s wife] would say “You idiot, get back into bed”. What helped me; it’s why I’m in the nick [condition] I am today and have a better quality of life, is through Helen Walters and the hypnosis. If it wasn’t for that I’d still be scared.BA: “So she helped you get it out, externalise it”?Garry: “Whatever she did made me realise that whatever was done, whatever took place isn’t going to hurt me, that’s what I realise now and that’s why I’m not so scared now”.BA: “The procedures they [the abductors] carried out on you, were they invasive”?Garry: “It’s hard to…it’s…something took up the full width of my ear, it was buzzing, like interference, it was the full width of my mind and it was buzzing. There was this thing on the other side like a flap and there were two eyes on it. In this place there was like an object up on the wall and it was watching me and it was something horrible, I didn’t know what it was”.BA: “Malcolm mentioned a lens type thing in the room with you”.Garry: “Aye, yes, the black lens thing, about seven feet wide and it was the shape of a black eye and there were four packs, one there and there”. [Using his hands, Garry indicated the general shape of an eye with equidistant four objects framing it] “They were like, you know how you get a box of chocolates and some have lines on then the packs, they were like that? They were making this object fold in on itself like a black liquid and it would start spinning round and making a perfect ‘whooshing noise’. I’m used to listening to engines running and this was a perfect noise, a perfect like, whooshing noise”.BA: “Whooshing, a whooshing noise,… like air being moved”?Garry: “Aye, well like something, like it was all off balance then spot on like it was running perfect. They turned me round again and there was like a circular hole in the floor and there was a gel like substance like wallpaper paste, a clear gel and I saw something moving in it and one of these creatures climbed out of the gel. At this point I jumped out of the hypnosis. Now, some of these creatures looked like…they were bruised and had to be in this gel stuff, you know if you’re in water, it’s a good shock absorber say you were in a liquid it was in a vacuum. In a liquid you could move in dimensional arcs without being splattered, you know? I think this gel stuff was something to do with that”BA: “You mean you thought it was something to do with protecting against ‘G’ force”?Garry: “Yes like that, but it was connected with healing as well”.BA: “What else do you remember”?Garry: “I was taken to this place and I saw these things”. [Garry sketched out odd, almost sperm shaped objects]. “I saw these things like they were really, really thin and they had a funny shaped head and there were lots of them and they kept coming towards me, bending on themselves and going away.Now, this place I was in, it was like a red mist and these things were swimming in the red mist and all these things kept coming, big ones and wee ones and they were all looking at me and then they were like, you know, an eel would do and they were all coming up looking. They would fold back on themselves and head away. I think these things; you know how you get tadpoles and frogs? Well.I think these things were these bigger things, the tall things. [For clarification, I pressed Garry on this point: according to him, the reference to frogs and tadpoles is an earthly comparison to a pre-adult stage in the development of the tall, frail, translucent entities. We also discussed similarities between what Garry described and the phenomena of ‘Rods’, allegedly ultra fast, thin, eel like entities captured fleetingly on individual frames of film and videotape by researchers in Mexico].BA: “ Garry do these images come separately like snapshots or do they flow smoothly into one another”?Garry: “Like snapshots, even with the hypnosis it wasn’t clear, it jumped around”.BA: “What about other hypnotic sessions”?Garry: “Aye, I remember in one of the sessions… these things were strong… and they could move, oh yes they could move. This thing looked into my life, one thing I will state, right, put this on record, I meet people who know me and I don’t know who they are, its like certain sections of my life, years, are missing out of my memory, I can back this up with some of my friends. This thing looked into my life”.BA: “Do you think it stole your memory”?Garry: “Well, no, it never stole my memory, it looked into my life and I looked into it’s [life] and it couldn’t stop me… and it thought it was funny, it just… it thought it was funny. Then it said to me “I’ve a life like you but different, things happen to us” Like it was showing me. I don’t remember what it did show me, but it did, it did look into my life. And it couldn’t stop me looking into its and it didn’t like it.It had a problem with it because I think in didn’t know I could do what I was doing to it. I was in a state, fear and this thing was you know trying to calm me down, like I was really freaking out. I would have done what I had to do to get away from there, I’d have stabbed, murdered, anything to get away. I remember rocks; somewhere they took us, like rocks. Have you ever seen slate? Jagged, all these rocks were like that, like slate sticking up.These things were standing there behind the rocks, like they were waiting for us coming there. I also remember floating like you’ve no control over where you’re going. You can’t do anything because you’re just everywhere, no co-ordination, no control at all. I remember that because I was panicking.There was another thing, later. Kim (his wife) took a seizure and I had to take the boys to her mothers. I was working and I couldn’t look after them, so I took them to her mums. It was half six at night I was heading back with the boys and I was worried, I was in deep despair, really worried and I was panicking and crying to myself.Then there was this huge big, like thing, like a flash over the car, everything in the car, the whiteness, like magnesium white started to come in all over the car. It poured in all round us and the boys were screaming and…ahhh, I remember at the side of the road, stopped at the side of the road and I asked Garry (his oldest son) what he thought and he said “It was like being in heaven”. The youngest lad, he was being sick, but Garry, that’s what Garry actually said… “It was like being in heaven… like being in heaven”…']"

Keith Rylance (39), his wife Amy (22), and their business partner, Petra Heller (35) were on their property, which was being developed as ""Whispering Winds"" winery. Other potential activities were also being developed at the location.The following account comes from interviews conducted by us with them, along with primary source material such as TV interviews.Keith Rylance told us that he had gone to sleep in the caravan bedroom at about 9.30 pm. Petra retired to her bedroom in the caravan annex. Amy stayed on a couch watching TV in the caravan annex ""lounge room"". Each of these locations were in close proximity, separated by a window and wall respectively from the lounge room.Petra\'s room had a door leading to the lounge room, which was left ajar. The door to the bedroom, where Keith was, apparently was open to the lounge room. Amy apparently fell asleep on the couch. A storm was in the area.Around 11.15 pm, Petra was reportedly woken up and when she entered the adjacent lounge was confronted by an extraordinary sight, that allegedly quickly overwhelmed her. A rectangular beam of light was being projected through the open window of the caravan lounge room.This light beam appeared to be truncated at the end. Inside the beam Petra claims to have seen Amy in a sleep prone position, being carried out head first through the window. Underneath her, also within the beam were the items that had been on the coffee table adjacent to the couch Amy had been on. Before apparently fainting in shock Petra saw that the beam was coming from a disc shaped UFO hovering just above the ground a short distance away, near a tree at the rear of the clear section, immediately behind the annex caravan house.Petra reports she believes she was only in a faint for a very short period of time. Regaining consciousness, she began screaming. Keith reports that he was awoken by the commotion coming from Petra. As he came from the caravan bedroom and stepped down into the lounge room annex Keith claims he was confronted by the sight of a highly agitated Petra and the contents of the coffee table on the floor in front of the window.He told us that he soon realised that the window screen was torn in both a vertical fashion and along the bottom of the window frame. Keith indicated that initially he couldn\'t get any sense out of Petra who was crying and very agitated, so he rushed outside trying to locate Amy.She was reportedly nowhere to be found. Keith states when he started to be less agitated himself he was eventually able to get from Petra an idea of what happened. Keith claims he initially refused to believe what Petra was telling him. He said he rushed outside again trying to find his wife.Eventually as the situation became clearer, Keith indicates he decided to call the police.Keith call the Tiaro police around 11.40 pm reporting that his wife had been abducted and imploring that the police should come out. The manning status at that time meant there were some delays in the police coming out, but about hour and a half after the initial call Senior Constable Robert Maragna from Tiaro and an officer from Maryborough arrived at the site.Initially police thought they might have been walking into a situation involving foul play, even perhaps a murder scene, but then the bizarre circumstances of the alleged events came into focus.The two people, Keith and Petra, at the Gundiah property were claiming that Amy Rylance had been abducted by a ""spaceship""! The officers were struggling to keep an open mind.They were joined later by Sgt. John Bosnjak, the officer in charge of the Tiaro police. He had been asleep when the police called him to assist in the investigation. The three officers continued their investigations at the site. They confirmed that Keith Rylance and Petra Heller appeared to be in an agitated state and that there was no sign of Amy Rylance. The torn screen was examined.A flowering bush, commonly known as ""yesterday, today, tomorrow"" was located immediately outside the left side of window, had indications of possibly being affected by heat or another mechanism along its right side. Oddly another flowering bush, a hibiscus, located immediately on the right hand side of the window area was not affected in the same way. The police took samples for possible later testing.UFO Depiction While the police were at the property, a phone call came through, which was taken by Keith Rylance. A woman was calling from Mackay indicating that she had taken a somewhat distressed and apparently dehydrated young woman from a BP petrol service station on the northern outskirts of central Queensland city of Mackay, some 790 kilometres to the north of the Gundiah - Tiaro area.The young woman turned out to be Amy Rylance, and the female caller was ringing to advise that Amy was apparently all right and was at the Mackay hospital, where she had been examined by a doctor. Keith handed the phone to Snr. Constable Marangna.Given these extraordinary circumstances Mackay police were called in, making a total of three police stations involved in the investigation -Tiaro, on outskirts of central Qeensland, Maryborough on the coast and Mackay, some 790 kilometres to the north of the Gundiah - Tiaro area.A statement was notarised by the Mackay police with a Justice Act acknowledgement, that required Amy to acknowledge that she had stated was true to the best of her knowledge and belief, and that if it is admitted as evidence, that she may be liable to prosecution if she had indicated anything in it that she knew was false.This statement indicated that she last only recollected lying on the couch at the Gundiah property. She had no recollection of the events that Petra described, but claimed she then next remembered waking up lying on a bench in a strange rectangular room. llumination came from the walls and the ceiling. She was alone.She indicated she called out and heard what seemed to be a male voice, asking her to be calm and that everything would be alright and that she would not be harmed. Soon an opening appeared in the wall and ""a guy"" about 6 feet tall walked into the room.The man appeared to be slender in build but in perfect proportion, covered head to foot in a full body suit. He had what seemed to be a black covering mask on his face, with a hole for his eyes, nose and mouth. He repeated his calming assurances. Amy felt she had been there a while.The guy told her they were returning her to a place not far from where they took her from, because the lights were wrong at the property and it wasn\'t safe. She then indicates she found herself lying on the bed and falling asleep.The next thing she recollects is that she woke up on the ground with trees around her. She felt disorientated, could smell the ocean, and indicated she was not sure how long she tumbled through bushland, but seemingly it was for a long time, but she felt she wasn\'t making much progress.She then came out onto a road that looked like a highway and saw a light from a petrol station. She walked into the station, where staff seeing her state, tried to offer some assistance. She accepted some water, as she felt somewhat dehydrated. Initially she was not able to answer identifying questions, and didn\'t know where she was.She was also asked if she had been drinking or was on drugs, to which she said no. Amy indicated she felt tired, sore, drained and lethargic. She asked a woman at the service station to take her to the hospital, as she didn\'t know of where else to go. The woman and her friend took Amy to the hospital.Later Amy spoke with two police officers and also spoke with her husband Keith from the hospital. She then went to Mackay police station where she gave the statement of events. Amy also indicated that this sort of thing had never happened to her before, but when she was in 5th year school she had seen a large UFO surrounded by smaller objects.The police arranged to put Amy in a motel pending the arrival of her husband. He and Petra arrived during the day and indicated they spent considerable time with Amy discussing what happen. Extensive notes were apparently made and photographs were taken of a triangular arrangement of marks on her inner right thigh, marks on each heel and the growing out of her hair which she had dyed earlier in the week.Her hair had apparently started to show her former colour, suggestive that some considerable time had passed for her, apparently indicative of rather more than a few hours. Body hair had allegedly also become somewhat more pronounced that would otherwise would be apparent for the short time involved.Via an Newsagent\'s a copy of the Australian Ufologist magazine was purchased, Keith, Petra and Amy started to learn more about UFOs. Keith Rylance contacted the Australian UFO Research Network office number mentioned in the magazine. Diane Harrison took the call Date: Fri, 5 Oct 2001 15:20 p.m and for the next hour or so listened to the story that Keith and Amy told. Petra was apparently sleeping at the time.Given the nature of the story, its complexity and the fact it apparently featured the alleged use of ""solid light"", Diane decide to bring Bill Chalker into the investigation, making contact with him during the evening of Friday, October 5th.Paradoxically Bill was scheduled to talk at a Brisbane UFO conference on October 13th, and his topics included ""solid light"" cases and the application of science to alien abduction cases. Bill put a call through to them at the motel, securing permission to record the conversation.Once again Petra was not available to talk about her part in the alleged events. Keith Rylance went into considerable detail about the events, referring often to the notes they had apparently been compiling during the day. The details described covered the events Petra had witnessed, what Keith had experienced, and what Amy told them had happened to her during her experience.Finally Bill spoke with Amy, focusing mainly on the events before and after the claimed onboard experiences, because Keith had already gone into considerable detail about the latter.Bill discussed with Amy her general responses and her physical state and her current state of thought on her experiences. Keith Rylance seemed to want to control how both media and investigators would get involved. His desire to contact the media promptly drew from both Diane and Bill the suggestion that he should think very carefully about the possible ramifications of doing so. Keith seemed to feel that it was important to get the story out, as it would come out anyway and this way he could control the way it did.He was also trying to restrict the way the investigators could or should look into their experience. He claimed they didn\'t need to proof the experience. While he didn\'t directly witness the experiences he believed both Amy and Petra.Given the possible nature of the event, and that irrespective of the ultimate resolution of the affair, it seemed destined to be a big story, Diane and Bill decided to undertake an investigation. They had been given an indication from Keith Rylance that the three would wait for the investigators to come to Mackay.The claimants were in no apparent hurry to return to Gundiah. They gave permission for Bill and Diane to visit the property on the way. Bill arrived in the Brisbane area on Tuesday afternoon, October 9th.Diane and Bill then travelled to Gundiah, arriving at the Whispering Winds winery property, just after 10 pm. Because of the lateness of the hour, we got the witnesses permission to stay there overnight and to conduct whatever investigation we needed to do.Keith had arranged for a neighbour to regularly check on the two pets left behind, namely a parrot and a kelpie dog. He indicated to us that it would be okay to let the dog off for a run, but warned us it was very friendly but inclined to jump all over people. We let the dog off at some point and observed its behaviour. At one point it did jump up on the window where the damaged screen was located. This gave some support to the possibility that at least some, if not all of the damage, could have been caused by the dog.Some of the damage on closer inspection seemed suggestive of possible dog damage. Our inspection of the plant damage also suggested possible prosaic causes, such as heat stress. A plant at the front of the house had similar damage and a healthy flowering bush of the same species that was at the window, was examined by us at Mount Basset lawn cemetery has similar damaged.A gardener there we spoke to indicated that the species often had random or more extensive damage of a heat stress nature from hot sunlight. The prosaic possibilities for both the screen and the plant damage are only suggestive at this point and further investigation is required. We undertook extensive investigations at the property and the area. Police were very helpful.Our investigation generated many issues and questions, which we feel need resolution, in order to assist interpretations of these events. Further extensive investigations were undertaken in Mackay, focusing in particular at the area where Amy Rylance returned.These included attempts to reconstruct the circumstances of Amy\'s return, through onsite research. The BP petrol service station staff were spoken with and a surveillance video tape that may contain Amy\'s visit there was provided to us by the station owner.This part of our investigation also generated many issues and questions that need resolution if we are to approach any measure of certainty about the real nature of the events alleged.UFO Depiction Keith Rylance indicated to us he would be available to us when we got to Mackay, but it was made clear to us early on the first day of our investigations there that this wasn\'t probably going to be the case.When we contacted the motel where they had been the night before, their third motel in Mackay, we learned they had apparently already checked out that morning.We left messages on their phone but didn\'t hear from Keith until early on the afternoon of our second day, as we were leaving Mackay. In his mobile call, Keith apologised for not being available, but was indicating they had relocated to an unspecified location after having fled the area.The primary reason for this Keith indicated was that they claimed they had a kind of ""men-in-black"" experience. In this case Keith was reporting a pursuit of their vehicle by a high powered dark brown 4 wheel truck. The nature of this event apparently frightened Keith, Amy and Petra, prompting Keith to attempt to loose the vehicle and eventually leave the area.Before the completion of this preliminary report (14th October) we have heard from Keith again. We remain hopeful that they will get into more direct contact with us.This affair is both extraordinary and controversial. Many have rushed to judgement, but given it\'s complex and evolving dynamics, caution and patience is necessary. We have many issues and questions we would like to try to resolve.Further contact with the Rylances and Petra Heller may help this process.The case is far from closed and requires an objective, open-minded investigation. Only time will give us the possibility of resolution and certainty about this intriguing but controversial affair.Regards, Diane Harrison National Director of The Australian UFO Research Network Australian Skywatch Director', ""Airborne Ring Photographed over Salt Lake City, Utah, 2001The report included here was originally posted on the Coast to Coast AM web site with photographs.  On 03-01-01, A Salt Lake City truck driver was making a delivery in downtown Salt Lake City, when he became aware of a bright flash. As the driver looked for the source of this flash, he saw a ring-shaped object in the sky. Fortunately, he had a digital camera in his truck. He took several photos of the object, one immediately after the other.The photographs (seen below) clearly show the object as a dark, ring-shaped object. Ultimately, the ring would disappear into the cloud cover. The truck driver was interviewed by Art Bell about his sighting and photographs. There were two additional witnesses to the events, one a truck driver who was driving behind the first truck. He did not wish to be interviewed, and subsequently what he saw exactly is not known.The third witness was working on Beck St, and saw the ring-shaped object. He was later contacted, but never responded. More information: The primary witness and photographer of the object also related to an investigator that he took the photographs with an Aiptek pen camera. He stated that the ring did NOT appear to be smoke, and was clearly seen. This is evident from the photographs.When looking at the photographs in sequence, the object seems to move from left to right. With the truck moving from right to left looking at the object, at least part of the object's movement could be attributed to the movement of the truck, as the driver took the photographs. Another interesting aspect of the photographs is seen in photos 6 and 7. There is a type of hook seen only in these two picture. What this is, is anyone's guess. The ring-shaped object is also strange in that it appears to change shape slightly from photo to photo.Written by B J Booth"", ' Police Officers Encounter UFO, Waynesville, Ohio On Tuesday, April 25, 2001, a very strange object is reported by civilians and law enforcement officers in the evening skies near Waynesville, Ohio in Warren County. From their residence near the 4600 Block of Wilkerson Road, a husband and wife are the first to report a circular lighted object hovering silently in the sky to the south of their location. The big light of the UFO, pulsating or changing in both color and brightness, was said to be encased within a structure that resembled gridwork or cabling. The couple advised the Lebanon City Police Department of the object around 10:15 p.m. and the Warren County Communications Center dispatched a Waynesville police officer to the location. Upon arrival at the scene, the Waynesville officer confirmed the unidentifiable nature of the object and also reported that a second UFO was also in the area.     LOCAL: WHAT IS IT!Unit #2W30: I have NO IDEA, and you wouldn\'t believe it if you came out and saw it! There\'s two of them, just sitting stationary and blinking, I mean about five different colors, right here on Wilkerson, just off of South Main Street...   FEMALE OFFICER: This is 480-16   Unit #2W30: I\'m not kidding! Go ahead.   FEMALE OFFICER: Okay, we\'re on the backside of that, here in the lot because I couldn\'t stand it no more. Where is it at, is it in the air?   Unit #2W30: In the air! Okay? He\'s got the owner of the house has some binoculars and we\'re looking at these things and uh, it\'s just I don\'t know what they are! They\'re high up, they look like uh, they\'re up there but with our binoculars though, the ones he\'s got here, you can see them pretty clearly. There\'s probably five different colors, there\'s two of them and they\'ve stayed in the exact same spot the whole time. They\'re not stars, I can tell you that.     As other officers respond to the location and continue to view the abnormalities, dispatchers at the Warren County Communications Center telephone a base operator at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton/Fairborne, Ohio and also places a call to Airborne Express at the Wilmington Airport in Clinton County, Ohio. Both flight control facilities deny any knowledge of or responsibility for air traffic in the Waynesville, Ohio vicinity during the incident.   While the Waynesville police officers view the object from Wilkerson Road looking south, a police dispatcher also observes the same object from her position at the Warren County Communications Center in Lebanon, Ohio, looking north toward Waynesville. From review of the police tapes, it can be estimated that the primary object may have been in a general location between Waynesville and Lebanon near the intersections of Pekin Road and Route 42.   An officer with the Caesar\'s Creek State Police also notes the UFO from his location to the east of Waynesville. A third UFO is sighted in the area during the event, and the police witnesses repeatedly affirm a cogent distinction between the suspected UFOs and routine stars and airplanes. The objects move off by receding further into the distance as other officers from the Ohio State Patrol arrive on the scene.   Dispatchers at the Ohio State Patrol and the Warren County Communications Center express frustration at having to handle this situation and their inability to address the reports and eyewitness confirmation from their officers.   The next evening, Wednesday, April 25, UFOs are again reported in the same area at 9:48 p.m., viewed from Wilkerson Road and also by officers observing from a location near the Waynesville Airport. Disturbingly, another unusual object is seen in the area seven hours later and reportedly pursues a motorist near Genntown, Ohio (about 5-miles from Waynesville). A female complainant advises the Ohio State Patrol of her \'extreme concern\' regarding a triangular object with ""super bright lights"" that pursued her automobile while traveling on Route 122 at 5:00 a.m., April 26.   These and other details were acquired from eyewitness interviews, analysis of various police reports and evaluation of police tapes acquired through the Warren County Director of Emergency Services. Additional data was gathered through field investigation conducted on April 27th and April 28th.   Consideration has been given to the possibility that this situation was engendered by a misperception of routine stars and planets by both civilians and police officers on both evenings. This theory was first advanced by Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center, who was advised of the incident by the Ohio State Patrol while the sighting was in progress. The star \'Sirius\' was identified by Davenport as a likely candidate for misperception, but after sober review of the police tapes acquired from the Warren County Department of Emergency Services, this attempt at explanation is not looked upon favorably. source: Kenny Young, ufo@fuse.net']"
1957, ,"['1957 Lake Isabella UFO Photograph Still a MysteryI decided to research if someone could possibly take a photo of something that was invisible to the naked eye. I discovered that our eyes only see a very small amount of the infrared, or ultra-violet radiation around us. Only about one octave of the available vibrations (wavelengths) is registered by our normal consciousness. Film is much more sensitive to the other more subtle energies on our environment. Judging by the colors around the \'57 UFO it is mostly vibrating in the infrared range. Another possible theory is that a field of rotating energy surrounding the craft absorbs photons from bouncing back and registering on the observer\'s eye. Those are some of the logical explanations, and yet, as illogical as it sounds I have seen UFOs become invisible on more than one occasion during the day and night - both in and out of the city with and without witnesses. Now you see it... now UFO don’t!Dr. Elmer Green is a physicist who worked just northeast of Lake Isabella for the Naval Ordinance Test Center, at China Dry Lake, from 1947 to 1957. He frequently heard about encounters with UFOs that would fly into range of their observation cameras.  Many times while range testing new weapons systems, good quality films were made of UFOs. He personally saw black and white still shots of UFOs that were taken by other scientists in his work group. While telling his story to scientist and author Richard Thompson, Dr. Green claimed that he knew of some 40 to 50 professional people who had some connection with UFO sightings during weapons testing at China Lake.Dr. Green had even experienced a clear UFO sighting with the base\'s photographic officer, Jack Clemente while watching an AJ Bomber coming in for a landing. According to Dr. Green, ""As the airplane flew over, we saw an object about 16 feet in diameter flying about 400 feet below the bomber. The object seemed to be a structured, mechanical craft. It had a semi-circular forward section that was amber colored. In the blink of an eye, the UFO flipped up to the wing of the plane. It remained there, pacing the plane for a few seconds and then it flew away at great speed vanishing from sight in 2 or 3 seconds.""Dr. Green noticed that even though UFOs looked mechanical, they often seemed to perform beyond the laws of physics. Even though they could move faster than the speed of sound, they did not produce a sonic boom. Dr. Green compared these maneuvers to a spotlight projected on the wall and he considered that they might be real physical structures that were somehow being projected into our space-time. Dr. Green also noted that during his early years at China Lake in 1947, many UFOs were sighted and that he would also regularly see the flashes from atomic bomb air bursts at the Nevada test site nearby. Some of Dr. Green\'s co-workers even speculated that there might be a connection between all the UFO activity and the frequent atomic testing.After showing the ‘57 UFO photo to a senior U.S. space engineer who has helped design many of our latest and greatest spacecraft including the Space Shuttle, I was given the following explanation: Ambient interstellar light saturates our atmosphere and becomes polarized to our earth\'s relative north/south rotation. This angle of rotation is given a relative 90 degree value which can be considered a phase that is unique to all other phases - such as a note on a scale of musical vibrations. As a UFO enters our atmosphere, its relative 90-degree north/south rotation will occasionally align with our Earth\'s polarity phase in harmony. During these brief moments of energy alignment UFOs become visible as bright lights or shiny metallic surfaces. This particular UFO is standing on edge, with its polarized energy field 90û out of phase from our Earth\'s own polarized energy field.When Life Magazine decided not to publish this authenticated UFO photo, my father left the original slide sitting unprotected in the desk drawer of his office which had a leak in the skylight. Over the years, mold grew on the film, but fortunately the original image of the UFO has remained intact. Even though this picture is very old it still tells the story of the future - the implications of which are enormous. I believe sometime in the future, the beings that operate these cosmic craft will reveal themselves and awaken all those who are still sleep waking through life.

The “Wardle incident” has become a classic in the UFO literature, but what really happened in this picturesque Lancashire village back in 1957? Dr DAVID CLARKE found some clues in recently released British Government files.It began at 10 o’clock on the clear, frosty night of 15 February 1957 and 19-year-old Gwynneth Fitton was walking home along an unlit country lane near Wardle, high on the Pennine Moors. Suddenly, her attention was drawn to a bright light moving between two hills near the cottage where she lived with her parents. As she watched it moved towards her and she could see the object was circular with a dome. Suspended below it was a light which switched from white to red at intervals. “The Thing,” stopped dead at rooftop height and Gwynneth ran to alert her mother, Dorothy, who on seeing the object cried out: “Good God, They’re here!” As both women watched it hovered silently and then disappeared swiftly across the moors.Shortly afterwards the Rochdale Observer published the story, playing up the fright the Fittons had received and asked: “Was Wardle Visited by a Flying Saucer?” More witnesses then came forward to admit they saw the same weird object in the sky. “None of the witnesses were believers in ‘flying saucers’ before,” wrote junior reporter Alan Fitzsimmons, “but after seeing such a strange sight their disbelief has been badly shaken.”While this was a fairly typical flying saucer sighting, it swiftly became the centre of a national controversy that led all the way to the Government. For when the local MP, Tony Leavey, heard about the sighting he raised it in Parliament, demanding to know if the Air Ministry had been “releasing objects which are normally described as flying saucers.” In reply the minister said the object seen at Wardle “did not emanate from outer space, but from a laundry in Rochdale.” It was, he said, two small balloons lit by a flashlight bulb that had been released by a mechanic, Neil Robinson, as part of an experiment to build a small radio-controlled airship. Mr Robinson, a 35-year-old radio ham, contacted the police after reading about the Fitton’s sighting in the local newspaper. He confessed that he had used hydrogen to fill two five-penny balloons which he had released on four separate occasions in remote locations. “It was just an experiment in tracing air currents,” he said. But he added the only light carried by the contraption came from a small bulb powered by a pen-torch battery.This confession did not satisfy the Rochdale Observer which claimed Robinson could not explain how he made the hydrogen used to inflate the balloons. The paper obtained a similar balloon and found that even when inflated its maximum diameter was a mere 12 inches. The paper also could not believe that such a tiny light attached to a balloon could have appeared as a glow brighter than a car’s headlamp to witnesses scattered around the town. And the mystery increased when debris was discovered on the moors near Wardle. One of the finds was a silver cylinder that appeared to be part of a transmitter from an Air Ministry weather balloon. Then two boys playing on the moors found other materials including aluminium rods, wire mesh and a parachute whose description sounds like the debris from Roswell! This development made the local paper even more suspicious and it stated: “The transmitter was found nearly two weeks after the sighting of the ‘saucer’, during which time there have been considerable snowfalls, yet the cylinder is perfectly dry and unmarked…” Further fuel was added to the fire when it reported how a “commercial-type aircraft” had flown low over Wardle “flashing unusually large coloured lights” the very night before parts of the balloon were discovered. The implication was the debris found on the moors had been delivered planted by the authorities as part of a cover up – but a cover-up of what? Not satisfied with the answer he had been given in the Commons, the local MP wrote to the ministry demanding a full investigation. In April 1957, an “Air Ministry special investigator with much experience in this field” was sent to make inquiries. According to formerly secret papers, he was an intelligence officer from DDI (Tech), the Air Ministry branch responsible for UFOs. Although the visit was said to have taken place under “the cloak of secrecy” it was widely reported by the Press. The officer quizzed five witnesses who were all “told to keep his visit quiet.” He also paid a visit to Neil Robinson and studied weather records, checking the prevailing wind at the time of the sighting, before he returned to London to write a lengthy report. In May the Air Minister wrote back to the MP saying that he had studied the officer’s report “and I am bound to say that on the evidence I agree with his conclusion which is that, in all likelihood, the objects seen were Mr Robinson’s balloons.” He added: “I appreciate that Mrs Fitton, who had the best sight of the phenomenon, does not share this opinion and I respect her view; but I feel that the probability – and probability is, of course more often than not, all we can achieve in these matters – is that the explanation we have given is the right one.”But there was more. Two decades later the Observer reporter who had covered the original story revealed how his dogged questioning had annoyed the authorities so much that his paper had received a personal visit from the Ministry. Many claims have been made about newspapers being ordered to discontinue their reporting on UFO incidents but few of these anecdotes have stood up to scrutiny. But according to Alan Fitzsimmons his reporting on the Wardle incident “came to an end when the very top man from the Ministry of Defence called at our office personally, took us into a private back room and read the Official Secrets Act to us with the warning to discontinue reporting further on that strange occurrence.” This warning convinced him even more “that there was something very strange about the whole affair.” Even stranger, he described the visitors to the Observer office as two men dressed in dark suits and bowler hats – the Men in Black!How accurate were these claims? Since the First World War the British Government has used a system known as D-Notices to advise editors that certain information, relating to subjects like nuclear weapons and Special Forces, should not be published. But D-Notices have no legal standing and are advisory only. Direct action to stop a newspaper publishing material subject to the Official Secrets Act is rare and would require authorisation at the highest level, a move that would leave a paper trail. Even at the height of the Cold War, such a move would be very risky indeed as news of the “silencing” could easily become a bigger story than the information it was meant to suppress. It is more than a little curious that in 1992, after Fitzsimmons made these claims, former work colleagues said they had “no recollection” of the use of the OSA against their newspaper in 1957.Another more fundamental discrepancy relates to the newspaper’s dismissal of Neil Robinson’s confession. Fitzsimmons said of him: “How I remember that laundryman! I asked him how he had filled the balloons with hydrogen and he was unable to explain, although he admitted it was not possible with the equipment he had. His story was untrue – and so were other hoax claims investigated at that time.”But friends and relatives of Robinson, who died in 1999, paint an altogether different picture. A cousin, Geoff Butterworth, remembers an exceptionally clever man, skilled in electronics, who had served in the RAF during the war. Robinson had much technical know-how and was certainly capable of launching a balloon with lights attached. During the 50s he had pioneered an infrared alarm system and was forever tinkering – Last of the Summer Wine-style- with inventions in the garage at his home near Rochdale. What’s more, Robinson was fond of practical jokes and was fascinated by films about alien invasions, such as H.G. Well’s War of the Worlds. As a child in the 50s, Geoff recalled hearing the commotion that followed the appearance of ‘The Thing’ at Wardle and the rumour that Robinson had “let off a flying saucer.” “I don’t think it was two five penny balloons and a torch bulb,” Geoff explained. He believes ‘The Thing’ was actually an Air Ministry weather balloon that he had obtained for use in his experiments to develop a model airship. This explanation fits the known facts, particularly the finds made on the Wardle moors after the sighting. “Neil Robinson was an astute, imaginative, showy and able guy and the perfect man to build a flying saucer at the height of talk about little green men,” Geoff told me. According to Ivan Corlett, Neil Robinson hatched the plot with his father, Granville, whilst working at the laundry. “It was done out of pure devilment,” he explained. “I remember going out as a child in the back of a big Ford van with this ‘Thing’ in the back and was told to stay inside. It wasn’t an ordinary balloon like it said in the papers, that was a red herring. It was something else. I do know they sent it up over the moors and caused all sorts of bother. It was definitely all a hoax and I remember father coming home a bit panicky because the police got involved and came to round to our house to take statements.”So while for years many people in Rochdale and across the world remained unconvinced by the “official explanation” the Air Ministry had no doubts. The “Wardle apparition” appears in a list of explained UFO reports prepared by DDI (Tech) in 1957 under the heading: “private experiments (Wardle incident).” And a senior MoD official who worked on the case at the time provides us with the final word:“The case shed vivid light on the ability (or otherwise) of people to observe unfamiliar things objectively. Given the specificity of time and place, there can be no serious question but that what they all saw was just the balloons; yet people whose good sense and faith we had no reason to doubt insisted nevertheless on the accuracy of what their imaginations had conjured up.”Source & References:Copyright 2005 David Clarkehttp://www.uk-ufo.org/condign/secfilwardle1.htm originally published in Fortean Times 196 (2005)http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/196_wardle1.shtml', 'The AftermathEditor\'s Note: I would like to thank Mr. Fogl for sharing his amazing story with us at the UFO Casebook. I hope all of you read his account of the taking of two photographs of a flying disc from the S. S. Ramsay in 1957. He had, at one time, because of false information being spread about his photographs, decided to deem them as a hoax, but now, he wants the truth to be known.UFO Snapped from ShipFlying Saucer Review Vol. 5 #1 Jan/Feb 1959RADIO OFFICER T. FOGL, of Harleyford Road, London, S.E.11, gave FLYING SAUCER REVIEW a graphic account of UFO sightings while at sea. The two striking photographs shown here are reproduced with his permission. One is an enlargement of the other.""In 1955, stated Mr. Fogl, I was on a Panamanian ship Eagle. Its call sign HOOF. Perhaps some of my colleagues will remember me, especially on the British Guiana Coast. I would like though to go back a little to 1954. About then I read a book ""Flying Saucers Have Landed,"" lent me by a fellow radio officer. I became interested in UFOs, but had an idea that it was all a hoax. I soon changed my mind about that!We had been on the way to Philadelphia from Rotterdam. It was November 25, 1955. At about noon we heard an ear-splitting noise and whistle, followed by a thunderous roar. It all lasted a few seconds. Everything on board shook from vibrations caused by the noise. When we rushed on deck, there was nothing to be seen.At that time on the bridge were the Master, Chief Officer and 2nd Officer, preparing to take O.R. and noon position. They saw nothing pass over the ship. There was just the roar. Nothing else.Well, I had left it at that and forgot all about the matter until three days later, the 28th, I recall. It was nearly 5 PM, and time for our tea. I sat in my radio room reading some magazines when the 3rd Officer came in and asked if I would like to see a neat formation of jets. I ran with him to the wheelhouse and then on the bridge. At first I could see nothing unusual about the ""planes"". Then it struck me.They were not moving! At the same time one ""plane"" climbed steeply, yet the rest did not change their position. They just hung there. I grabbed my binoculars to have a better look. Sure enough, there, high... very high, were four huge discs. I could hardly believe my own eyes. But they were there all right. They must have been gigantic. We estimated them to be about 40,000 ft. high, and over 25 miles away from us. But I am not sure.The sky was clear and, only here and there tiny clouds. The sun was near setting and the horizon red and gold. In the sun\'s rays, the objects seemed to give out red vapour trails, but that could have been sun reflection. The discs were flat and black. They were surrounded by a haze, the same as if heated metal in cold weather will have circulating round it in waves of heat. As I watched the discs something strange happened. One disc completely vanished from my eyes and reappeared in another place. By that time, the Captain, Chief Officer, 3rd Officer, and I were all very excited. When I finally managed to get the binoculars back, I was just in time to catch final glimpses of the disc.The moment I got on watch I called S.S. Falcon and asked the radio officer if he had seen anything funny. He said, no-but did I hear an xxx urgency to all ships. In turn I said, no. The copy of the message:xxx CQ VCJ (Urgency all ships from Valentia Radio)""Following intercepted from Valentia Radio VCJ at 23.42 GMT addressed urgency xxx = Begins = Following received from British ship Franconia GBRQ at 23.30Z Begins = At 23.OO Hrs Z, s.s. Olympic Light/ELGU at about 21.45Hrs, in position 36° .04""N, 31° .55""W - a luminous object rose resembling big shooting star, followed by a luminous tail about 20 times the main body. Appeared 20° above the horizon bearing 8Master -That message was from the previous day, the 27th, said Mr. Fogl. It was now 1957, when I was this time on the British ship S.S. Ramsay, we were on our way from Vancouver to Port Elizabeth, via Panama. We had passed San Pedro and the U.S. Navy ships patrolling and having exercises. It was about 2.30 PM, when I was in my cabin doing my laundry. Suddenly the 2nd Officer called me to see a disc! Without being told twice, I grabbed my Yashica C reflex camera from my wardrobe and dashed on the side of the bridge. Sure enough, there was a queer looking object hovering in the distance. It was suitable for a shot so I waited. In the meantime, I tried to keep under control my shaking knees and hands, and watched the disc.It made no noise and was not more than a mile away. It was silver and black. There was no smoke or any gases coming from it. However, under the disc, a red light pulsated. We thought it tried to signal, so the 2nd Officer grabbed the Aldis and flicked back, but there was no response. At last the disc came down near enough and I got one shot. Then it turned and I shot again.The disc was rather thick, and had a flat dome. There were no ports. However, there were some black marks, and I wonder if they were not some sort of exhausts. Then we noticed a ladder! Whether it really was a ladder I can\'t say. It could be some depression in the craft.The object moved very slowly and stayed with us for a few minutes. Then it shot with quick acceleration towards a rugged mountain, and the desert coast of sun-baked California. I would like also to mention that Vancouver Broadcasting Station announced that some strange objects and lights had been seen by hundreds of people. If I am not mistaken this happened in the first days of December.The AftermathBy Graham Conway - September 1, 2001Thad Fogl had his film developed in Durban and found that indeed he had captured two very good pictures of the strange aerial object. The majority of the ship\'s crew members requesting copies for themselves. On returning to England, he contacted either the Daily Mail or Daily Express newspaper, (he can\'t recall which), who in turn replied that they had no comment to make.His next step was getting in touch with Brinsley le Poer Trench, who at that time was editor of Britain\'s Flying Saucer Review Magazine. Much to Thad\'s surprise, he received a phone call from this gentleman the following day announcing that he had some good news. It was to be told that Mr. Trench ""knew"" that the craft was from Venus, how many crew members it carried, and in what manner its propulsion system worked!This announcement did nothing to impress Mr. Fogl: on the contrary it merely served to anger him to the point that he arranged to meet with this ""fountain of knowledge."" When face to face, Thad bluntly told Mr. Trench that he was dismayed that he was prepared to disseminate such outrageous lies to a gullible public, that there indeed were serious people who believed in such things as he had witnessed and photographed.Finally adding he thought him pompous, they parted company on less than friendly terms. By this time, The London Illustrated News and Life magazine had somehow obtained copies of his photographs. Publishing them resulted in a deluge of publicity attention that overwhelmed Thad. Finally, on receipt of a letter from a young boy in the United States who had enclosed a dollar seeking a copy of the photo saying that was ""all he had,"" Mr. Fogl said to himself ""ENOUGH."" Without further ado, he contacted Gordon Creighton (present editor of FSR) and admitted to fabricating the picture and story. In essence, anything but truthful, but at least it got the ""monkey off his back.""By this time, Thad had left his seafaring days behind him and was working for Hawker Siddley, on rocket propulsion systems. For this type of work he had to be vetted by M15 (Britain\'s Intelligence Service) on a very regular basis. Consequently, admitting to and chatting about flying saucers was not likely to bolster his credibility in anyone\'s eyes, least of all theirs!So, from then on, he simply clammed up. At this point, forty years have passed and Thad felt that he should accept his wife\'s suggestion and go public again, and set the record straight once and for all.Therefore, it was my good fortune to be permitted to interview him in July 2001, at his home here in British Columbia. Mr. Fogl readily agreed to my request to record the interview, which lasted about forty-five minutes. He was at ease, and readily answered my questions, also providing details of his two ocean sightings in a sequential manner. Additional questioning revealed that he had not experienced any further paranormal events in his life. Acquiescing agreeably to my desire to take photographs, we concluded what was for me a very interesting meeting.permanent link: http://www.ufocasebook.com/2008c/tfogl.htmlsource & references:Submitted to UFO Casebook by T.

', 'The Levelland, Texas Landings - 1957One of the most baffling and most publicized cases of a close encounter of the second kind occurred in 1957 at Levelland, Texas. Actually, there were no less than eight well-documented reports of the same craft, and seven more that were unverified; the seven called in by anonymous persons. Some of those who made their reports have kept their names secret. Sadly, this is the case in many UFO reports. Many of those who had thought they were doing the right thing have regretted their decisions later because of public ridicule. However, the Levelland case has many respectable witnesses who have come forward, especially several members of the Levelland Police Department who witnessed the fantastic sights of November, 2, 1957 in the town of about 10,000. To understand the full impact of this case, a chronological account is preferred.11:00 P.M... Only one hour after the Russian Government launched their second dog-carrying satellite, and before America was aware of it, an unusual set of events began in the small town of Levelland. Patrolman A. J. Fowler was on desk duty when he received the first of fifteen different frantic phone calls in what would be an unforgettable night for him and his fellow officers. About four miles west of Levelland, Pedro Saucedo and his friend Joe Salaz were driving in Pedro\'s pickup truck when they saw a brightly lighted, cigar-shaped object moving in their direction. As the object approached, Pedro\'s car engine began to sputter, and his headlights went out. Finally, the car rolled to a stop. Later, a terrified Saucedo would sign a statement which indicated that the object was about 200 foot long. Calling Fowler from the small town of Whiteface, his call was dismissed by Fowler, who thought that the two men had been drinking.11:45 P.M... Fowler receives a second call from a man identified only as Mr. W. The man was driving near the town of Whitharral, about four miles east of Levelland, when he came upon a brilliantly lit egg-shaped object, actually sitting on the pavement in the middle of the road. Mr. W\'s car engine stopped, and his headlights failed. Frightened, he left his vehicle, and after a brief period of time, the object silently lifted up to about 200 ft. and disappeared. His car started back up, and he sped away to make his phone call to Fowler.12:00 A.M... Fowler receives a third call, this time from a man who was traveling 11 miles north of Levelland, when he spotted an unusual flying craft landed on the road. His car also faltered, and he sat watching the silent object for a brief period of time, until it rose up and disappeared into the night. Again, after the craft left the area, his car started, he left the scene, and called the Police station.12:10 A.M... A nineteen year old freshman from Texas Tech University, Newell Wright, was driving 9 miles east of Levelland, when his car engine began to cut out, and his lights falter. After stopping his car and checking for some loose wire under the hood, he suddenly noticed a vivid object sitting on the pavement ahead of him. He described the object as about 125 foot long, and a bluish-green in color. Frightened, he tried to start his car again to no avail. He sat in his car; hoping that another car would come by. None did. After a little while, the object silently rose and faded away into the sky. Afraid to make a report, the young student waited to tell his parents when they arrived home from a trip. They encouraged him to report what he had seen. He made a statement at the Sheriff\'s office, and his report was included in the US Air Force\'s Project Blue Book.12:15 A.M... Officer Fowler receives another call. This time from a man in a phone booth near Whitharral, who, as he was driving 9 miles north of Levelland, encountered an object of some kind sitting in the middle of the road. He had the same mechanical problems as the other motorists, and after the craft took off, his engine started again. At this point, Fowler\'s curiosity and concern motivated him to call the other patrol cars in the area, and report what he had heard from the different travelers. Later, he would state that ""something odd"" was going on. In a matter of a few minutes, two different Officers radioed in that they had seen two different flying objects with extremely bright lights, but had not yet encountered any engine problems.12:45 A.M... A man driving west of Levelland very close to the spot of Saucedo\'s initial sighting, sees a large orange ball approaching in his direction. The man testifies that this unknown craft softly lands on the road about 1/4 mile away. The motorist also related a very interesting fact. He stated that the craft, orange at first, became a bluish-green color upon landing on the road. He also noticed that the craft spanned the width of the road. After the craft landed, his engine also failed, and he sat in the cab of his truck, which was lit up by the glow from the craft. After a time, the craft lifted up and left the area. This man did not make a report at the time of the sighting, but did file a report the next day.1:15 A.M... Fowler receives a call from a truck driver from Waco, Texas, who states that while driving northeast of Levelland, he witnessed a large, glowing object, and at the same time, his truck engine failed. Fowler noted that the caller was extremely frightened. The driver added that the object was about 200 ft. long, and after it left the area, his truck roared back to life, and he ""got the hell out of there.""1:30 A.M... Fowler receives the first definite sighting of the object by two law enforcement officers. Sheriff Clem and Deputy McCullough, who were receiving constant updates from Fowler, had observed a ""large, glowing object,"" pass across the highway. The two officers were trying to track the object by the radio calls from Fowler. They were about 4-5 miles outside of Levelland when they saw the object. The two officers stated that the object looked like a large, red sun and it lit up the entire highway as it passed over.The events of the night finally came to an end.  Fowler would later state that he had received no less than fifteen calls from observers who claimed to have seen the unusual craft. He also said that they were legitimately excited, and some of them extremely frightened. The unusual number of witnesses to the Levelland events only solidified the theory that some unusual craft had been in the area of the city for at least 2 1/2 hours that night. The dramatic accounts of the landings on the road set this case off as one of the most convincing cases of an encounter with the unknown. The next day the small town of Levelland, Texas was bulging over with reporters, anxiously awaiting some official explanation for the events of the night before. The Air Force did investigate these sightings, but offered no reasonable cause for what was seen that night, save for an electric storm. The case is still considered ""unexplained.""Listen to short audio file of CBS radio coverage of  Levelland, Texas, LandingsB J Booth', 'Old-Saybrook, Connecticut, December 16, 1957 (UFO with Occupants) A reported sighting of a UFO with occupants seen through its windows, having a number of similarities to both the Squyres and the Knight cases, occurred in Connecticut, five years later, on December 16, 1957. It was investigated by Richard Hall, former Assistant Director of NICAP and currently NICAP\'s Research Consultant, and Isabel Davis, currently of the NICAP staff. Mrs. Mary M. Starr, a resident of Old Saybrook and a former teacher with a Master\'s Degree from Yale, told the NICAP investigators that she had been alone in her home on the night of December 15. ""I went to bed early,"" she said, ""about 10:00 o\'clock. Some time between two and three in the morning, I was awakened by a bright light in my room. I looked out the window and there was what I first thought was a crippled airplane in my back garden. But when I got my eyes really open, I saw that it was a cigar-shaped object, brightly lit and with square portholes, hovering just above my clothesline. I could see men inside. . ."" The object, no more than ten feet from the north side of Mrs. Starr\'s home, was approximately 20 to 30 feet long and dark grey or black in color. It hovered motionless about five feet above the ground, between the house and the tool shed. She saw no wings, fins, or other appendages. Through its lighted windows Mrs. Starr saw two figures that passed each other, walking in opposite directions. ""I could see that it [the object] was so shallow that the men could not have been more than three and a half or four feet tall,"" she told the investigators. The occupants\' right arms were raised but no hands were visible. They wore a kind of jacket that ""flared out"" at the base, and their heads were unusual - square or rectangular, red-orange in color, and with a brighter red ""bulb"" in the center. She thought they might possibly be wearing some kind of helmets. The lower portions of their bodies were below Mrs. Starr\'s sightlines. She saw nothing else in the object, such as chairs or instruments. A third being came into view from the left. As Mrs. Starr leaned forward to see more clearly, the portholes faded and the entire shell of the object began glowing brightly (compare with Mrs. Knight\'s report). From the top end closest to the witness there arose a kind of six-inch ""antenna"" that oscillated and sparkled. After five minutes of glowing steadily, the antenna was retracted and the craft began to move. It retraced its original path, gliding smoothly in the direction from which it had apparently arrived. It then made a very sharp right-angle turn, appearing oval in shape. The hull had turned a dull grayish-blue and small, circular lights now outlined the entire rim. The UFO dipped and undulated, following the contours of a small depression to the north of the witness\' house, then tilted sharply and shot up into the sky at terrific speed, in total silence. Since most of the other houses in her neighborhood were unoccupied at that time of year, Mrs. Starr was the sole witness to this strange appearance, although there had been previous reports during the preceding weeks of objects sighted in the area. Because of her background, and because she had no conceivable reason to invent or embellish such a story, neither Miss Davis nor Mr. Hall could find any reason to dismiss her report out of hand. source:http://www.nicap.org/newlook/section_VII.htm', ""This piece of metal was picked up after a UFO explosion over Toninha's Beach, in Ubatuba, Sao Paula State, Brazil, in 1957. This sample was analyzed and the results showed a  99.99% pure magnesium. This other piece fell down from one of the three UFO's that had flown over the city of Caminas, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, on December, 1954. Tests proved the material to be 88.91% pure tin. Mr. Sued gave all three pieces of metal to Dr. Fontes, who in turn had one of them analyzed at the Mineral Production Laboratory of the Department of Mineral Production in the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture. Dr. Fontes personally delivered the samples to the chief chemist, Dr. Fiegl, an internationally known specialist. A qualitative, acid test was first made on a small chip, which showed that the fragments were truly metallic.One of the original fragments, designated Sample No.1 by Dr. Fontes, was subdivided into several pieces and two of the pieces were submitted to the Spectrographic Section of the Mineral Production Laboratory Semi-Quantitative Emmission Spectrochemical Analysis. One of the pieces was analyzed by Dr. Luisa Maria A. Barbosa. The analysis surprisingly revealed that the sample contained only the element magnesium. A second fragment of Sample No.1 was submitted to a separate spectrographic analysis by Mr. Elson Teixeira of the Mineral Production Laboratory. Mr. Teixeira confirmed Dr. Barbosa's finding that Sample No.1 was pure magnesium. Further tests were run on fragments of Sample No. 1. These included Debye-Scherrer-Hull powder pattern X-ray diffraction analysis, density measurement, and radiation tests. The significance of Dr. Barbosa's and Mr. Teixeira's findings is that it is impossible to produce any element, terrestrially, that is absolutely spectrographically pure. These results, therefore, are often cited by proponents of UFO extraterrestrial existence as proof that the Ubatuba material must be EXTRATERRESTRIAL. Unfortunately, this supposition cannot be proven, due to the lack of any further Sample No.1 fragments for verification analysis. The Ubatuba incident is certainly in need of futher verification, especially the details of the UFO incident itself. All we have is the word of one anonymous person who wrote the letter received by a newspaper. The case itself is dated by the receipt of the letter, and not the incident of the crash, so there are no first hand witnesses to the UFO incident itself.Source: The Encyclopedia of UFOs, 374, Ron StoryWalter W.

In the history of UFO reports, no case has received the world-wide attention as the Roswell event of 1947. Not only did the alleged crash of a flying saucer create mass coverage at the time of the event, but remains today as an often discussed case by which all other cases are judged. So many books and articles have been written about Roswell, it is not an easy task to write another, but I feel that no UFO enthusiast cannot include it among his comments. The Roswell event is the cornerstone of UFO research. The case offers everything one could imagine; a crash of some flying craft, direct, hands on testimony of witnesses who handled crash debris, government cover-up and secrecy, and most of all a list of participants which is generally listed at around 500 first and secondhand testimonials.Ironically, the alleged crash story originally died as quickly as it began. It would be many years before UFO researchers refueled the fire behind its enormous potential. Most all of us are familiar with the famous Roswell headline stating that the Army had captured a ""flying saucer,"" and then the retraction a few hours later, substituting a balloon for the crashed saucer. At the time of the original event, a sense of naivety and trust gave birth to a rapid, quiet acceptance of the retraction, and there the event died. But, fortunately, it was resurrected in 1976, and has kept pace with all other events of the last 50+ years. It would be January 1976, when ufologists William Moore, and Stanton R. Friedman were mulling over some interview notes from two witnesses whom Friedman had met with. A man and a woman, who both had knowledge of a crashed saucer in July 1947 in Corona, New Mexico were the key witnesses. A retired Air Force officer, Major Jesse A. Marcel asserted that he had first hand involvement in the crash debris, and the Air Force cover-up. The woman was Lydia Sleppy, who had been employed at an Albuquerque radio station KOAT. She claimed that the military had covered-up the story of a crashed saucer, and the bodies of ""little men,"" who were aboard the craft. She also claimed that the Air Force had literally stopped the sending of a teletype news report of the incident.The USA Military had announced to the world that it had captured a flying saucer on a remote ranch in Corona, and then about four hours later corrected the story, saying that what was found was just a weather balloon with a radar reflector kite. We have two stories. Which one is the truth? Though subsequent confirmations of the balloon theory continue, as long as we have firsthand witnesses who defy this explanation, the investigation must continue. Of all of the explanations given to Project Bluebook, it is quite strange that the Roswell story was never mentioned. The story that died so quickly was rarely mentioned from the beginning, the only one, to my knowledge, was in a mid-1950\'s lecture by UFO enthusiast Frank Edward. It seems that from the beginning, a grass roots group of believers would perpetuate this grandstory. When we solve the puzzle of the many UFO reports, it will be due to this grass roots movement. The truth is hard to kill.It would be June 24, 1947, when the term, ""flying saucer"" was coined by pilot Kenneth Arnold. He used this term to describe UFOs flying over Mr. Ranier, and only a couple of weeks later, the phrase was used by the Air Force to explain what had been found in Corona, New Mexico. The alleged crash debris was flown to Eight Army Air Force Headquarters in Ft. Worth, Texas, and somehow between the time that Jesse Marcel Sr. had handled the ""other worldly"" material and its arrival in Ft. Worth, the strange material had lost its luster, and became just a weather balloon. The Air Force had effectively murdered the eye witness accounts, and made fools of all who were involved. Marcel would categorically state that the debris he held in his hands, and showed to his family, was not the same material shown in photos of the ""balloon wreckage.""What happened to the saucer debris? An uncertified, but controversial document might provide an answer. Supposedly a brief prepared for then President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower,  this document was authored on November 18, 1952. It asserts that on September 24, 1947, President Harry S. Truman ordered the genesis of the highly top-secret ""Operation Majestic-12,"" to study the remains of the Roswell crash.  These papers would arrive in a plain manilla envelope, postmarked Albuquerque, in the post of Los Angeles television producer Jaime Shandera in December 1984. In the early part of 1987, another copy was given to Timothy Good, a British ufologist. Good released it to the British press in May.These documents caused quite a stir, but their authenticity cannot be established beyond doubt. The jury is still out on the MJ-12 papers, but many ufologists view it as a hoax. The issue itself is not insurmountable, however, as a huge amount of evidence still remains to establish the Roswell crash as a reality.The Roswell saga actually began in Silver City, New Mexico on June 25. Dr. R. F. Sensenbaugher, a dentist, reported sighting a saucer-shaped UFO fly over, that was about one-half the size of the full moon. Two days later, in Pope, New Mexico, W. C. Dobbs reported a white, glowing object flying overhead, not too far from the White Sands missile range. On the same day, Captain E. B. Detchmendy reported to his commanding officer that he saw a white, glowing UFO pass over the missile range. Two days later, on June 29, Rocket expert C. J. Zohn and three of his technicians, who were stationed at White Sands, watched a giant silver disc moving northward over the desert. On July 2, a UFO was tracked at three separate installations; Alamogordo, White Sands, and Roswell. In Roswell, on the same day, Mr. and Mrs. Dan Wilmot saw a UFO. They report its appearance as ""two inverted saucers faced mouth to mouth,"" moving at a high rate of speed over their house. Enter rancher Mac Brazel.The events of Roswell began on either July 2 or July 4 (there is some disagreement here). A throwback to western days, William W. ""Mac"" Brazel, a sheep rancher, would etch his name forever into UFO history, a designation that he neither desired, nor appreciated. A common working man, Brazel was foreman of the Foster Ranch in Lincoln County, near Corona, New Mexico. Brazel was a family man, but his wife and children lived in Tularosa, near Alamogordo. The reason for this arrangement was so his children could attend better schools than they would at Corona. Brazel stayed in an older house on the ranch, where he tended sheep, and the general chores of the ranch. He was a simple man, content with his job, family, and his life. Mac would be thrust into the limelight for a brief period of time, and ultimately regret ever reporting what he was about to discover on the range of the Foster Ranch.An evening thunderstorm was raging at the close of another workday; the storm was highlighted by numerous bolts of lightning. These summer storms were not uncommon for these parts, but this evening Mac noticed something different...  a sound, like an explosion mingled with the typical sounds of a storm. Two of Mac\'s children were staying with him that night at his farm house. Mac retired with the children, and temporarily forgot about the sounds of that night. The next day\'s sun brought Mac out again to ride the fences, and check on his sheep. He was accompanied that day with a seven-year-old neighbor boy, William D. ""Dee"" Proctor, who often rode with Mac. As they rode into the open field, ahead of them they noticed an area about a quarter of a mile long and several hundred feet wide, covered with debris of some type. The debris was composed of small pieces of a shiny, metallic material, a material that Mac had never seen before. The sheep would not cross the fragmented pieces, and they had to be taken the long way around that day. Because of the curious nature of the debris, Mac picked up some of it and carried it back to store in a shed. Little did he know the significance of his find.One of his children, Bessie Brazel recalled: ""There was what appeared to be pieces of heavily waxed paper and a sort of aluminum-like foil. Some of these pieces had something like numbers and lettering on them, but there were no words you were able to make out. Some of the metal-foil pieces had a sort of tape stuck to them, and when these were held to the light they showed what looked like pastel flowers or designs. Even though the stuff looked like tape it could not be peeled off or removed at all.""""[The writing] looked like numbers mostly, at least I assumed them to be numbers. They were written out like you would write numbers in columns to do an addition problem. But they didn\'t look like the numbers we use at all. What gave me the idea they were numbers, I guess, was the way they were all ranged out in columns.""""No, it was definitely not a balloon. We had seen weather balloons quite a lot, both on the ground and in the air. We had even found a couple of Japanese-style balloons that had come down in the area once. We had also picked up a couple of those thin rubber weather balloons with instrument packages. This was nothing like that. I have never seen anything resembling this sort of thing before,- or since...""Later that afternoon, Mac took young Dee Proctor back home, a journey of about 10 miles. He took along a piece of the debris that he had found, and showed it to Dee\'s parents, Floyd, and Loretta. Mac tried to get the Proctors to go back with him, and look at the strange material strewn in the fields.Floyd Proctor would later state: ""[He said] it wasn\'t paper because he couldn\'t cut it with his knife, and the metal was different from anything he had ever seen. He said the designs looked like the kind of stuff you would find on firecracker wrappers...some sort of figures all done up in pastels, but not writing like we would do it.""Loretta Proctor remembered: ""The piece he brought looked like a kind of tan, light-brown plastic...it was very lightweight, like balsa wood. It wasn\'t a large piece, maybe about four inches long, maybe just larger than a pencil.""""We cut on it with a knife and would hold a match on it, and it wouldn\'t burn. We knew it wasn\'t wood. It was smooth like plastic, it didn\'t have real sharp corners, kind of like a dowel stick. Kind of dark tan. It didn\'t have any grain...just smooth.""""We should have gone [to look at the debris field], but gas and tires were expensive then. We had our own chores, and it would have been twenty miles.""The first hint that the debris could be ""not of this world"" would come the next night from Mac\'s uncle, Hollis Wilson. Mac told Hollis about his find, and Hollis urged Mac to report the findings, since there had been reports of ""flying saucers"" in the area as of late. On July 6, Mac was going to Roswell to strike up a deal for a new pickup truck. He took along some of the debris, and stopped off at the Chaves County Sheriff\'s Office and spoke to George Wilcox. The story of the find was not significant to Wilcox until he actually handled a piece of the silvery material. Wilcox telephoned the Roswell Army Air Field, and spoke to one Major Jesse A. Marcel, who was the base intelligence officer. Marcel told the Sheriff he would come into Roswell and talk to Brazel about his find. Word of the goings on began to spread rapidly in the community, and soon Mac was talking to radio station KGFL about the incident. Mac told the station what he knew over the telephone.Marcel and Brazel met at the Sheriff\'s office. Mac told Marcel what he knew, and showed him a piece of debris. Marcel reported the results of his interview to Colonel William H. Blanchard back at Roswell Army Base. A decision was made for Brazel to go out to the site, and investigate for himself. Marcel would take his old Buick, and Army Counter Intelligence Corps officer Sheridan Cavitt accompanied him in a Jeep all-terrain vehicle. Following Marcel back to the ranch, it was too late that day to visit the site, so they all three stayed in Mac\'s ranch house. After a dinner of beans, the three headed to the site the next morning. After a brief look around, Mac left Marcel and Cavitt, returning to his chores.', '1991 Police Helicopter FLIR Footage of UFO ExaminedFair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

2007, ,"['26/4/2007-Pilot\'s UFO Shock 2007by Joel de WoolfsonUFO sightings are being investigated by the Ministry of Defence.Two experienced airline pilots on separate flights saw something up to a mile wide off the coast of Alderney on Monday afternoon. Surprisingly, Jersey radar equipment did not pick up the object, although an air traffic controller said he had received simultaneous reports from the Aurigny and Blue Islands pilots.Aurigny\'s Captain Ray Bowyer, 50, said he saw the strange object during a flight from Southampton.He spotted a bright-yellow light 10 miles west of Alderney while his plane was about 30 miles from the island and at 4,000ft.""It was a very sharp, thin yellow object with a green area. It was 2,000ft up and stationary,"" he said.""I thought it was about 10 miles away, although I later realised it was approximately 40 miles from us. At first, I thought it was the size of a 737.""A 737 is slightly smaller than a jumbo jet.""But it must have been much bigger because of how far away it was. It could have been as much as a mile wide.""As he continued his approach to Alderney, Capt. Bowyer saw a second identical object further to the west.""It was exactly the same but looked smaller because it was further away. It was closer to Guernsey.""The sightings come days after reports that scientists have discovered outside our solar system an Earth-like planet capable of supporting extraterrestrial life.""I can\'t explain it. At first, I thought it might have been a reflection from a vinery in Guernsey, but that would have disappeared quickly. This was clearly visual for about nine minutes.""The sightings happened at about 3pm. Capt. Bowyer, who has flown commercial planes for about 20 years, said he had described the objects to air traffic control and filled in an incident report.""As I got closer to it, it became clear to me that it was tangible. I was in two minds about going towards it to have a closer look but decided against it because of the size of it. I had to think of the safety of the passengers first.""He added that the experience had been quite scary.""I""m certainly not saying that it was something of another world. All I""m saying is that I have never seen anything like it before in all my years of flying.""Paul Kelly, 31, the air traffic controller who was on duty, said the Blue Islands pilot had made a similar report, but nothing had appeared on his radar.""The pilot from Blue Islands was en route to Jersey at the same time and as he went past Sark he described an object behind him to his left,"" he said.""The description was very similar to Captain Bowyer\'s and they described it as being in exactly the same place. But they were looking at it from opposite sides.""The pilot told him the object had been 1,500ft beneath his plane.The Blue Islands plane was at 3,500ft at the time so, again, both pilots placed it at the same altitude.""If the object was stationary, our equipment would not have picked it up because the radar would have screened it out.""']"
1958, ,"[""The Loch Raven Dam Incident, 1958On October 26, 1958 at 10:30 PM,  near the Loch Raven Dam, north of Baltimore, Maryland, two men were traveling in a car. As they approached a bridge, they saw what appeared to be a flattened out, egg-shaped object hovering approximately 100-150 feet from the top of the bridge.Slowing their vehicle to get a better look, they approached to about 75 foot from the bridge. Suddenly, their car went completely dead. The two men stated that it was like they just cut the key off.  Nothing electrical worked. The driver attempted to restart the engine, but to no avail.The object and the malfunction of their vehicle frightened the men to the point that they hid behind their car. They were able to closely watch the UFO for 30-45 seconds. All at once, the object flashed a white light, causing the two witnesses to feel heat on their faces. The flash was accompanied by a loud sound, like thunder.The UFO now began to slowly rise straight up. It was extremely bright as it did, causing the edge of the object to be fuzzy. Within 5-10 seconds the object was out of sight. The men were then able to restart their car, and rush to the nearest phone to report their sighting. The Ground Observor Corp was contacted first, but did not respond. The men then talked to the Towson Police Department, which sent two patrolmen to the scene.The two men soon began to experience a burning sensation on their skin, and went to St. Joseph's Hospital in Baltimore for treatment. They were examined, and each man returned to his own home.Follow-up investigation would reveal some more details of the incident. The bridge was double-arched, about 40 foot tall, and 500 feet long. The distance from the witnesses to the object was estimated at about 3/4 of a mile. Also, there was no unusual atmospheric conditions at the time, and the skies were clear.Project Blue Book investigated the case, but found no absolute cause for the appearance of the object. The case remains unidentified, although the Air Force did state that the object constituted no security threat to the United States.The two witnesses would subsequently be identified as Phillip Small and Alvin Cohen.B J Boothsource and references:Project Blue Bookwww.nicap.org"", '1958 - Close Encounter in the ""Devil\'s Canyon"" of Hunter, New YorkFair Use Notice: This web site contains some copyrighted material whose use has not been authorized by the copyright owners.

It was about 3.20 A.M. on Friday October 3, 1958... freight train no. 91 was enroute southbound from Monon, to Indianapolis. In the cab of the diesel locomotive were three men - Harry Eckman, the engineer, Cecil Bridge, the fireman, and Morris Ott, the head brakeman. Ed Robinson, the conductor, and Paul Sosbey, the flagman, were in the caboose. Cecil Bridge, the fireman, a former air force man with 450 hours of heavy bomber time, begins the story as follows... ""... we had just pulled past a little spot called Owasco. There\'s no town there - just a kind of crossroads. It was there we first noticed four lights in the sky ahead of us. They were moving lights. ""About that time the lights veered west. They crossed the tracks ahead of the train - about a half a mile ahead of us, we estimated. They were moving pretty slowly, too, at no more than about 50 miles an hour, four big, white, soft lights.""""Just the three of us in the engine saw the lights at this time. We were pulling 56 cars - that\'s a little more than half a mile of cars - and because of the angle at which these things were approaching and because they were so low right then, the boys in the caboose probably couldn\'t see them.""""...I talked to Robinson, (the conductor), and told him what we had seen. During the time we watched these things, from Ewasco to Kirklin, we did a lot of talking on that radio. The dispatcher in Lafayette could hear us, of course, but he never cut in. Conductor Robinson continues the story. ""I was sitting in the cupola, looking forward over the train, when Bridge called me on the radio. I had already noticed the four gobs of light but I couldn\'t make out what they were. They were half a mile ahead of the caboose - the whole length of the train. A little bit after he called me the things went away and we didn\'t see them for a few minutes... then all of a sudden they came back.""""I\'d say they were only a couple of hundred feet above the train as they came toward the caboose. And they weren\'t moving very fast - maybe 30 or 40 miles an hour. It was hard to tell - a fellow just doesn\'t notice details like that under the circumstances.""""The freight train is pretty noisy, of course, but I didn\'t hear any other noise, like the roar an airplane would have made. I think they were silent, or nearly silent, at least.""""They flew over us one after the other - big, round white things that looked about the colour of fluorescent lights, kind of fuzzy around the edges. They didn\'t glare and they didn\'t light up things as they went over. They just came back toward us, over the top of the cars, one after the other. Then they went on down the tracks maybe another half a mile and seemed to stop.""""Sosbey and I went out on the back platform where we could see them better, but they were getting pretty far behind us. We could see their lights but I don\'t remember whether they were bunched up or not. They were just there, we know that. We could see them behind us, right over the tracks.Cecil Bridge, observing the same objects from the engine, describes what he and the engineer and head brakeman saw. ""When these things shot back over to the east of us, they lit up much brighter than they were before. They turned in line, going north or northeast and we noticed that they lit up in sequence - the front one first, then number two, three and four. They changed course and came back past the train. They were going in the opposite direction to us when they made this pass. I guess they were at least a mile or two east of us when they did it.""The conductor, Ed Robinson, agreed with this description. He added: ""We didn\'t see them from the back end of the train for several minutes after they went away to the east and turned. But the boys in the engine were still seeing them. I got back on the radio with Bridge. He was watching them right then. They must have circled the train and gone north of us, real low, because the next time we saw them they came rushing up the tracks right in back of us. They were coming a lot faster this time - a lot faster than they had come back over the train the first time.""They were just above the tree-tops along the right of way, and they had changed their way of flying -- their formation. This time they were sort of flying on edge. Two of them were on edge - the two in the middle. The two on the outside were tilted at an angle both in the same direction. The four of them flew like that up the tracks behind the train - a tilted one on the east, two of them straight up and down, then the one on the west tilted just like the one on the east.""When they first came back over the train we could see that they were round things - circular shaped on the bottom. Then when they flew up the tracks in back of us we could see - Sosbey and I - that they were about 40 feet in diameter and maybe 10 feet thick. The two flying straight up and down were approximately over the edges of the right of way and about 200 yards in back of the caboose. If they had been flying flat down instead of edgewise. They would have just about have touched edges so they must have seen somewhere around 40 feet across the bottom.""Fireman Cecil Bridge continues: ""We had flashlights in the engine and in the caboose. Up on the head end of the train - in the engine where I was --we blinked our flashlights at the things and we waved the lights. We thought we might get them to come in closer. They did come down over the train a few minutes later, as Robinson related, but of course, I can\'t say they did it because we flashed the lights at them. At any rate they didn\'t flash any lights back at us.""""In the caboose we had a five cell sealed beam flashlight that throws a pretty good beam a long ways. When the things came down and flew right up the tracks behind the caboose, I grabbed that sealed beam flashlight and shined it on them. As soon as the light hit them they jumped sideways out of the beam. When they got back over the tracks I did it it again and they scattered. They acted like they didn\'t care for that light at all.""From the time Bridge first called us on the radio until the last time we saw them near Kirklin (38 miles northwest of Indianapolis) it was about an hour and 10 minutes altogether. They hung around the back end of the train but after we shined the light on them they didn\'t come in close any more. While we were switching at Frankfort they stayed away back up the tracks, just hovered there, until we moved on. Then they followed us again. When they finally went away at Kirklin, they just zipped off to the northeast and kept on going and we didn\'t see them anymore."" written by Frank Edwards', 'The Trinidade Island Photographs 1958Trinidade Island UFO PhotographTrindade is a small, deserted, rocky island located in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean, between the Brazilian coast and the African continent, more than six hundred miles off the coast of Bahia.During World War II, it was used as a military base for United States and Brazilian warships engaging German U-boats.It was abandoned after the end of the war, remaining completely deserted and forgotten until 1957.In October of that year a task force from the Brazilian Navy arrived there, under the command of Captain-of-Corvette Carlos Alberto Bacellar.The Hydrography and Navigation Division of the Ministry of the Navy had decided to build an oceanographic post and a meteorological station on the island for research connected with the International Geophysical Year (IGY).In early January 1958 the ship ""Almirante Saldanha"" left Rio de Janeiro\'s harbor and proceeded toward the Island of Trindade with a crew of three hundred. The ship had previously been a Brazilian Navy training vessel, but it had been converted into a hydrographic unit to be used for IGY-related research.It was operated by the Hydrography and Navigation Division, and, since October 1957, it had made several trips to Trindade, most of them connected with the Navy\'s oceanographic studies for the IGY.Several civilians were aboard the ship this time, officially invited to collaborate in the scientific studies which were underway at the island.One of these men was Almiro Barauna, a photographer and former newspaperman working as a ""free-lancer."" He was also an expert in submarine photography.After a routine trip, the ship arrived at the Island and stayed there for several days. It was scheduled to leave for Rio on January 16. On that day, at 12:15 P.M., when the ship was preparing to depart, a strange object was sighted simultaneously by a number of observers gathered on deck.The UFO came toward the island at high speed, hovered briefly over a peak, disappeared behind it for a short time, and appeared again to move away toward the sea.Mr. Barauna was taking pictures of the ship\'s maneuvers at that moment. He spotted the UFO and got four pictures of it.Barauna was later interviewed by reporter Joao Martins and his statements were published in the Brazilian magazine ""0 Cruzeiro"" in the March 8, 1958 issue. Here is a translation of that interview:Q. Mr. Barauna, what were the reasons for your presence aboard the NE Almirante Saldanha?A. The Navy had invited several teams specialized in submarine hunting to visit the Island of Trindade. I am a member of the Icarai Club for Submarine Hunting, and our group was invited for the last trip. So, on January 8, when the ship left Rio, I was aboard together with the following members of my group:Amilar Yieira Filho, captain of our team, a government employee (he has a job at the CACEX); Jose Teobaldo Viegas, instructor at the Aero Club of Niteroi and Air Force captain (retired); Mauro Andrade, from the London Bank; and Aloisio, municipal employee at the Federal District.We were going to try to beat some records on submarine hunting.Personally, I was going to take underwater photographs for the Navy and, also, to write some articles about the Island and the activities of the scientists working for the IGY.Q. Were any other civilians aboard, besides your group?A. Yes. There was Professor Fernando, a geologist, with two assistants, and also a photographer, and a reporter from the newspaper Jornal do Brasil. The three scientists left the ship and went to the island.""Q. Please tell me what was the date of the sighting? What happened?A. It was on January 16, at 12:15 P.M. The ship was preparing to leave the island, to come back to Rio. I was on the deck observing the operations to take aboard the boat used in the trips between the ship and the island (the island has no harbor).The sea was agitated. The weather was cloudy, clear, with no shadows. I had my Rolleiflex 2.8, Model E, which was kept inside an aluminum box for protection against the corrosive effects of water and salt. I had left my Leica with a telephoto lens in my cabin a few moments before. The deck was full of sailors and officers. Suddenly, Mr. Amilar Vieira and Captain Viegas called me, pointing to a certain spot in the sky and yelling about a bright object which was approaching the island.At this same moment, when I was still trying to see what it was, Lieutenant Homero, the ship\'s dentist, came from the bow toward us, running, pointing out to the sky and also yelling about an object he was sighting. He was so disturbed and excited that he almost fell down after colliding with a cable. Then I was finally able to locate the object, by the flash (of light) it emitted.It was already close to the island. It glittered at certain moments, perhaps changing its own light - I don\'t know. It was coming over the sea, moving toward the point called the Galo Crest. I had lost thirty seconds looking for the object, but the camera was already in my hands, ready, when I sighted it clearly silhouetted against the clouds.I shot two photos before it disappeared behind the peak Desejado. My camera was set at a speed of 125 [125th of a second], with the aperture at f/8, and this was the cause of an overexposure error, as I discovered later.""The object remained out of sight for a few seconds - behind the peak - reappearing bigger in size and flying in the opposite direction, but lower and closer than before, and moving at a higher speed. I shot the third photo. The fourth and fifth ones were lost, not only because of the speed the saucer was moving, but also for another reason:In the confusion produced as a result of the sighting, I was being pulled and pushed by other persons also trying to spot the object and, as a consequence, photographed the sea and the island only - not the object. It was moving out to sea again, in the direction from which it had come, and it appeared to stop in midair for a brief time. At that moment I shot my last photo (the last on the film).After about ten seconds, the object continued to increase its distance from the ship, gradually diminishing in size and finally disappearing into the horizon.Q. Did you hear anything unusual during the sighting? Was the object emitting any sound?A. I am not sure, to be honest, because of the noise made by the sea waves against the island\'s rocks, as well as for the yelling aboard the ship at the time. However, I think that I heard nothing besides those sounds.Q. What was the color of the object?A. It showed a dark gray color, appearing to be surrounded - mostly in the area ahead of it - by a kind of condensation of a greenish, phosphorescent vapor (or mist).Q. Did the object appear to be metallic?A. Yes. It was obviously a solid object.Q. How was it flying? Any special characteristics?A. Yes. It showed an undulatory movement as it flew across the sky, like the flight of a bat. And when it came back, it changed speed abruptly, with no transition, in a jump.Q. Do you know how many persons aboard the Almirante Saldanha sighted the object?A. The object was sighted by almost all the people on the deck at that time, including Lieutenant Homero, Captain Viegas, and Mr. Amilar Vieira.Q. What happened after the sighting?A. The ship\'s commander and several officers from the garrison wanted to see what I had got in the photos. As I was very curious too, I decided to develop the exposed film at once, aboard the ship. The processing was done under the supervision of several officers, including Commander Carlos A. Bacellar. But only the negatives were seen aboard. The reason: There was no photographic paper for the copies on the ship at that time. The negatives, however, were seen and examined by the whole crew.Q. Did you keep the negatives in your hands?A. Yes.Q. Were you under any pressure to give up those negatives to Naval authorities?(click on image to see full size)A. No. Commander Saldanha da Gama (the ship\'s CO) and the other Navy officers aboard were very kind. They never tried to get the negatives from me.Q. What happened when the ship came back to Rio?A. The ship stopped first at Vitoria, in the State of Espirito Santo. As it was going to stay there for two days and later travel to Rio, we were permitted - the civilians from the submarine-hunting group only - to leave the ship there and to take a bus for the rest of the trip. Later, two days after the arrival of the Almirante Saldanha at Rio, Commander Bacellar (ex-commander of the Navy Post at Trindade) appeared at my residence. He wanted to see the enlargements made from the negatives and asked permission to take them to the Naval authorities.Two days later, they were returned with congratulations. I was also requested to appear at the Navy Ministry as soon as possible. They wanted to ask me certain questions and to see the negatives again.Q. And what happened there?A. I was interviewed by several high-staff officers, who asked me all kinds of questions. I went there twice. At the first meeting, they requested the negatives for examination. They were sent to a civilian organization, the Cruzeiro do Sul Aerophoto grammetric Service, remaining there for four days. I was told by the Navy officers that the analyses proved they were genuine -excluding definitely the possibility of a trick or falsification. On the second visit, they performed several time-tests. While I worked with my Rolleiflex, taking shots at the same time intervals I had used to photograph the object, three Navy officers with chronometers registered the times.They came to the conclusion - based on these tests as well as on studies concerning the ship\'s position and examinations of charts of the island - that the object was flying at a speed between 900 and 1,000 km./hour [about 600 mph]. The object\'s size was also estimated on the basis of studies related with the island\'s details also appearing on the photos, diagrams drawn on charts, graphs, et cetera. The object was about 120 feet in diameter and about 24 feet high.Q. Do you know anything about the official report on the case?A. I saw a dossier which was consulted many times during the interrogation. However, I didn\'t read what was written there. I was also informed that my photos, mixed with other pictures, had been shown to witnesses of the sighting - to be identified. The result was positive.Q. Do you know anything about any photos by other people aboard the ship?A. No. Besides myself, there were at least four other persons with cameras at the time of the sighting. But apparently they were not able to spot the object in time, or were paralyzed by their emotions.Q. Were you warned against something by the Navy\'s authorities? Was there some recommendation?A. Yes. They requested me to keep the matter secret for some time. I was permitted to publish the case only after authorization from the Navy. The permission was granted, verbally, on the night of February 15, by Commander Bacellar. They made only one restriction, which I cannot mention for the reason that I have given my word.Q. Do you know if your sighting was the first over the Island of Trindade?A. I was informed of four other sightings over the island during those thirty days preceding the incident of January 16. I was also informed of another thing: At one of those sightings, the object was photographed by a Navy sergeant.His photo obviously was not released and probably never will be - the reasons are evident. Besides those four sightings, there was also the RADAR case. A target flying at supersonic speed was tracked by the radar of the Almirante Saldanha on January 15.Q. Did you receive any money from the Navy for your work at the Island of Trindade?A. No. I was there as a guest.Q. Did you receive any money from the Navy for your photographic work, or for the enlargements you made for them?A. No. I only received the photographic paper to be used for enlargements.Q. How many enlargements have you given them.A. Thirty-eight.Q. One last question: What kind of impression did you get from observing the flying saucer?A. I am absolutely sure it was a controlled object - either directly or by remote control - but very well operated, in any case. The general impression of people aboard the ship was the same: It had come to make a close observation of the ship.Immediately following the publication of the photographs, the Brazilian Navy refused to make any official statement confirming or denying the incident. However, proofs from the original negatives were sent to the other armed forces and to Brazilian President Kubitschek. According to the press, the narration so impressed Mr. Kubitschek that he became convinced of the veracity of the happening.On February 24, three days after the photos were first published in the press, the Ministry of the Navy finally made the following official statement: ""With reference to the reports appearing in the press that the Navy is opposed to divulge the facts concerning the appearance of a strange object over Trindade Island, this Cabinet declares that such information has no basis.This Ministry has no motive to impede the release of photographs of the referred-to object, taken by Mr. Almiro Barauna, who was at Trindade Island at the invitation of the Navy, and in the presence of a large number of the crew of Almirante Saldanha from whose deck the photographs were taken. Clearly, this Ministry will not be able to make any pronouncement concerning the object seen, because the photographs do not constitute sufficient proof for such purpose.""On the morning after the photos of the flying saucer were published in the press (February 22), the Almirante Saldanha departed Rio to continue its mission in connection with the IGY. Two days later, however, the ship docked at Santos (February 24) for voyage repairs; this was the first chance that newspapermen had an opportunity to interview officers and men aboard.The U.S. Assistant Naval Attache\' was in Santos at this time, in connection with the visit of U. S. Coast Guard Cutter Westwind, and had an opportunity to visit aboard. The commanding officer, Capitao-de-Mar-e-Guerra (Captain) Jose Santos Saldanha da Gama, had not seen the object and was noncommittal. The executive officer also had not seen it but, arriving shortly thereafter, had formed the opinion that those on deck had seen it.The captain had reported that his secretary, a lieutenant commander, had seen it, but this officer, when personally questioned, avoided discussing the matter. Later, it was learned that the photographer was accompanied to the dark room by an officer who waited outside the door while Barauna developed the negatives alone. When the Westwind\'s commanding officer paid a visit to the Almirante Saldanha, Captain Saldanha da Gama freely discussed the flying saucer incident and showed the original proofs to the callers, but again did not commit himself.Federal Deputy Sergio Magalhaes sent a note to the Ministry of the Navy on February 27, protesting the Navy\'s failure to secure sworn statements from witnesses. ""For the first time in flying saucer history, the phenomenon was attended by large numbers of persons belonging to a military force, which gives these photographs an official stamp.Threats to national security require greater official attention and action,"" said the deputy. In the middle of all the publicity, other sighting reports came to light, including one by a naval officer who saw a UFO a month before the sighting from the Almirante Saldanha, off the coast of Espirito Santo. The commanding officer and crew of the Ata Tridente had seen a UFO several days before the Saldanha episode, but had kept the in formation secret.Source: Ronald Story\'s, ""The Encyclopedia of UFOs"", pages 366-369']"

A recording of the conversation (in Greek) between the pilot involved and the airport control tower has been made public. A copy of the official document named 'Lightning 2' commanding two F-16's to intercept the UFO can be viewed below.On 11 October,  2007,  at 3:20 am,  the captain of Olympic Airways flight 266 from Athens to London noticed an extremely unusual object moving erratically to the west of Athens. The object was somewhat star-like in appearance,  however much brighter and larger with a constantly shifting shape.Meanwhile the captains of Olympic Airways flights 730 to Kos and 700 to Rhodes reported the same thing. The sighting was then confirmed by Athens Airport control tower, whose employees observed the object moving towards Karystos, a small town on the Greek island of Euboea. At this point the Greek Air Force was contacted.The Greek Air Force confirmed that they too were visually monitoring the object from their radar station at the top of Parintha Mountain near Athens,  and had observed that it was traveling at incredible speed, and did not fit the description of any terrestrial craft.The staff at the Air Force radar station later described the UFO as large, of an unusual shape,  and very bright. Air force staff were requested to photograph the craft and did so (no pictures have come to light yet).At this point two F-16’s were sent up to intercept the UFO, while the various control towers monitored the object from earth. The object then shot off at incredible speed skyward,  and the Jets failed to indentify anything. While both staff at the Athens Airport and the Parintha Mountain Air Force Radar Unit confirmed that they clearly observed the object their radars picked up nothing. The ensuing deliberate cover-up of this incident by the Greek authorities is being treated as fact by that country's media.Possibly the most bizarre aspect of this sighting is that although the object was witnessed simultaneously by three pilots with decades of flying experience between them,  staff at multiple radar and ground control stations and the Greek Air Force, who actually sent jets up to chase it,  says it has been dismissed by some Greek Government officials as a mistaken sighting of... wait for it… Venus!This, despite the fact that the captain of flight 266 remains convinced he saw a UFO. With that in mind, are these Government officials  planning to request an investigation into the capability, if not sanity, of their country's  Air Force ground control staff?  Don’t hold your breath.It is hardly surprising,  that if indeed aliens are visiting earth they would take an interest in Greece, that cradle of western civilization. What is more surprising is western media’s complete non-coverage of this incident,  and the continuing and sometimes absurd attempts by governments to deny the obvious as far as UFOs are concerned. Perhaps the ancient Athenian culture of intellectual curiosity and questioning existing belief systems has been replaced by one of secrecy, concealment,  and the idea that the public does not have the right to know what is happening in the universe around them.

The Voronezh landing remains an unsolved mystery.', ""Unknown Object Photographed over Wurzburg, GermanyWurzburg, Germany - March 8, 2009Last Sunday I had a rather strange encounter with a disturbing object in the sky above Wurzburg, Germany. I was walking along the railroad lines along the river Main to scout new fishing locations. It was already pretty late, it was getting dark, I started to freeze and I wanted to move back towards the city, when I noticed the silence. There was no car, nothing. I stopped and looked around me. Although it was a pretty bad day to be out, nature had a strange beauty in the fading daylight. Suddenly I got a strange feeling in my chest, like when I was standing on a vibrating platform, but only very faint. Suddenly I felt weak and then I noticed an object in the sky. It was hovering just at the base of the deep hanging clouds and disappeared every once in awhile into the moving clouds maintaining its altitude. There was no sound except some light wind, only the strange humming feeling inside my body, maybe like pulsating electricity, I have no idea, I haven't felt like that before. At first, while it was still pretty close, I didn't move at all. I was like in a shock. But while it slowly moved away I realized that what I was seeing might be quite unique and took out my cell phone. I wanted to take a picture but the display wasn't working right. The images had stripes and pressing the trigger didn't do anything. Only when the object was already pretty far it worked, I shot the attached picture and then, seconds later, the disk was covered in clouds once more and I never saw it again. Here are a few facts: size: can't tell, but I would guess it was pretty big, like 50 meters maybe? The clouds, although deep this day, are still a few hundred meters above ground, so the thing should be bigger than just 10 meters. Shape: flat gray disk with lights at the bottom Height: just below the clouds/ in the clouds Time: around 6 PM, dawn Speed: slowly moving across the sky Lights: three white/bluish and one red, no blinking etc. Duration: very hard to tell, it felt much longer than it probably was, maybe 15 seconds for the whole encounter As I work for the local city administration I cannot give you my real name, nobody would take me serious anymore here in Wurzburg. I never believed in aliens or UFOs, but this thing got me thinking and I actually have no satisfying explanation for it. Maybe you guys know more about this thing, especially because it doesn't look like the typical UFO that I have seen on the many silly photos on TV. Regards, Martin ""]"
2004, ,"[' Mexican Military Officials Release Video of UFOsSOURCE: EFE News Agency. DATE: Tuesday, May 11, 2004 7:20 AMMEXICO (EFE) -- In an unprecedented move for this country--and perhaps thewhole world-- military authorities have made public a video showing 11unidentified flying objects (UFOs) captured by an aircraft belonging to theSecretariat of National Defense (SEDENA). This video shall be presentedtoday by journalist and UFO researcher Jaime Maussan.In an exclusive interview with the La Prensa newspaper, Maussan stated thatthe Secretary of National Defense himself, Ricardo Clemente Vega Garcia,authorized the broadcast of this material to both domestic and foreign newsmedia.According to the researcher, the encounter occurred on March 5, when anaircraft belonging to the Mexican Air Force, a Merlin C26/A, was engaged indrug interdiction patrols. At around 17:00 hours it detected the presence of11 objects following it.The routine flight took place between Copalar, Chiapas and the State ofCampeche. The encounter took place near Ciudad del Carmen, Campeche. It wasthere that the aircraft, belonging to the 501st Air Squadron was performingits routine patrol when it suddenly detected the presence of an object onits radar at an elevation of 3500 meters, as well as through its infraredequipment (FLIR).The airplane immediately pursued the object, which according to the videofootage, lost itself in the clouds. Minutes later, the presence of otherobjects -- for a total of 11 -- was detected. They followed the aircraft andsurrounded it.These UFOs were captured on radar and by the FLIR gear. However, they werenever seen by the aircrew despite having been two miles distant from theaircraft at one point. The crew consisted of eight monitoring specialists,among them the pilot, Maj. Magdaleno Castañón Muñoz, radar operator Lt.Germán Martin Ramirez and FLIR operator Mario Adrian Vázquez Tellez. Thesemilitary men were interviewed and claimed having never seen a similarphenomenon, since the speed and movements detected by radar confirmed thefact that the [objects] were not aircraft.Translation (C) 2004.Scott Corrales,  Institute of Hispanic Ufology (IHU).', "" Staffordshire Mini UFO Flap August 2004For those who remember August 2004 in the UK, you'll recall it was cool, wet and thundery, but for Staffordshire UFO Group it was an eventful time. From the start of that month we had been made aware of a sighting by a retired RAF Engineer of an orange ball of light late one night in the area of Cannock. Events took a sudden turn on Saturday 7th when a call was received again from Cannock at 9:55pm. The witness described an orange ball of light seen at around 9:40pm which was silent and stationary with an unusual triangular shaped pattern in its centre. The object hung in the sky for several seconds before shooting away at high speed. The following day more reports came in describing a similar object either shooting across the sky or remaining stationary for short periods. Now statements have been analysed, it is now possible to ascertain that the first sighting occurred in Perton near Wolverhampton at 4:20pm where video footage was taken of 6 silver objects high in the sky in two 'V' shaped formations. Analysis of this footage indicates that the objects are not wind borne with some unusual anomalies that are still being analysed. The second report comes from Shenstone at 5.45pm (again in daylight) of a bluey/white light. Subsequent reports were received from Stafford and Millford of an orange ball of light at around 9:20pm. A photograph was taken at Shugborough Hall showing a curious orb of which the photographer was unaware. Sightings of this orange ball of light often described as having something at its centre were then seen between Stafford and Cannock and later in the areas of Shenstone and Lichfield up until the early hours of the 8th August where again video footage was taken at 2am on the 8th .The strangest thing about these sightings is the shear number of reports that were received, not just from the night time but daytime also. In addition, two independent video recordings were made of both the daytime objects and the orange ball of light. Also two individual photographs were taken, one from Millford, the other in Shenstone.In conclusion and notwithstanding the fact that research is incomplete, the sightings have proved beyond any shadow of doubt that people were witnessing something. The photo and video footage will never prove that the objects witnessed were extraterrestrial but the body of witness testimony adds credence to the evidence surrounding the facts: 'something did happen, something was photographed', ‘something was out there.’ The investigation will continue!source:Graham Allen (SUFOG)Staffordshire UFO GroupNote: The still is from footage taken at approx 2 am 8th August 2004 in Lichfield, Staffordshire, UK."", 'Watching the heavens from Dalnegorsk  December 29, 2004-“I got scared of a UFO only once. It was during a 1980 expedition to Kamchatka when we saw a strange disc landing near a 90-meter-deep lake bottom,” reveals Valery Dvuzhilny, one of Russia’s most notable specialists in the investigation of unidentified flying objects. Dvuzhilny, a biologist by occupation residing in a town of Dalnegorsk some 500 kilometers north of Vladivostok, made investigating UFOs the main purpose of his life. In his four-room apartment, the scientist has established a laboratory equipped with obsolete Soviet-era tools and a collection of about 1,000 samples of materials found at nearby sites where at least one UFO is thought to have touched down. Dvuzhilny was the first to suggest that space visitors use geological fissures in the planet’s crust to orientate themselves with Earth before descent. Dalnegorsk County, which is considered the most anomalous zone in Primorye and is also notable for its 14 caves, is located on a geological “break” that contains a field of powerful electromagnet and gravitational energy. The counties of Ternei and Olga and the city of Arsenyev are also locations of interest for UFO researchers, with more than 10 unexplained sightings in the past 20 years. According to Dvuzhilny, on January 29, 1986, a UFO was observed in the Vysota-611 Mountain near Dalnegorsk. Burnt fragments found at the site revealed the rare-earth metal lanthanum and silicon shales discharging magnetic radiation. In 1995, Dvuzhilny participated in the International UFO Conference in California, America. Pavel Reshetnikov, head of the anti-aircraft forces in the Russian Far East, was also invited to the conference but was prohibited from leaving Russia because of his military status. However, he later confirmed that a UFO was tracked by radar over the Amur River in the early 1990s. According to Reshetnikov, the object could not be identified as either a missile or a plane. Each sample found at the Dalnegorsk site has been subject to multiple scientific tests, including isotope analysis. Of the samples found 50 kilometers away at the Krivaya River, dozens were proven to have been burnt at a temperature exceeding 2,000 degrees C. According to Dvuzhilny, thorough analysis of burnt metal pieces found at sites so remote from each other suggest they were affected by extra-terrestrials, who may have been interested in them as sources of lead and silver. With his modest laboratory tools Dvuzhilny lacks funds to perform his scientific activities. To conduct an isotope analysis in Moscow costs $1,000, but Dvuzhilny, who earns very little money teaching students at an ecology club, does not give up. He is an ample enthusiast, as are his colleagues at the Science and Research center ‘Kosmopoisk’(Search of Cosmos) where Dvuzhilny works as a coordinator. Dvuzhilny, the energetic sky watcher featured in both Japanese and American documentaries, is currently planning an expedition to the Amgu territory, and dreams of creating Russia’s first UFO museum in Dalnegorsk.  By Tamara Kaliberova source:http://vn.vladnews.ru/News/upd29_1.HTM', 'Bizarre UFO Incident; Amelia, Ohio, Clement County, 01-12-04  DATE: Monday morning, January 12, 2004, 2:58 a.m. Location: Yelton St., Amelia, OH (Clermont County) Summary: A lighted, disc-shaped object with a hump was seen hovering silently over homes near Amelia, Ohio.  The object, which moved in a bizarre fashion said by witnesses to ""drop and stop"" near the East Fork vicinity, was sighted by at least three separate persons in Clermont County at 2:58 a.m., early Monday morning, January 12.  Also seen was a shadow that \'transformed into a ball\' -- one person describing a peculiar tannish-brown object, separate from the lighted UFO-which strangely \'rolled down the side of a house.\' The sighting was first reported by one of the witnesses to the Cincinnati UFO hotline on Monday, investigation of the incident has turned up additional witnesses to the incident.   INCIDENT At 2:58 a.m. on Jan. 12th, 2004, 21 year old student Susan T. (name and phone number on file, deleted for this report) and her neighbor Jeff F. were in Susan\'s driveway when they spotted an object high in the sky.  Susan states that the object was hard to describe but said it was disc shaped with a ""hump"" on top.  Susan said that at one point the object stopped and began to ""drop."" She thought it was going to hit the ground.  However, it suddenly stopped and hovered and then it began to drop again.  For several minutes this object ""stopped and dropped.""  She finally lost sight of it as it went below roof top level of her house.  Susan went on say that this object must have been ""covered in a million lights"" and also said there was a red rotating light on the top of the hump and white lights on what she described as the belly or bottom of the object. She claims that the object seemed to turn on its side so that she could see the bottom part.  This turning or flipping caused the object to look like it was changing shapes and getting bigger.  It was when the object turned up that the ""bottom"" was covered in white lights that dimmed then grew brighter and changed patterns. Susan said that the object was -- from her perspective-larger then your thumb at arms length.  She does not know how far away it was but said it may have been over as far as State Route 222. (There are several streets between there; Lumsford and Eiler Lanes.) She said the object may have been in the vicinity of the Phantom Fireworks Factory on Route 125, somewhat to the west of her location. Susan explained that she felt she was being watched and grew very frightened.  Both she and her neighbor (Jeff F.) sat in the truck and watched this object for over an hour.  It was 4:15 a.m. when it finally slowly went down behind her house. Susan then stated that something very strange happened.  Right after the object went behind her house she saw what appeared to be a ""shadow"" on her roof that turned into a ball and rolled down the roof.  She said that her neighbor also saw the shadow. Being very frightened neither person went behind the house to see where the object went.  Susan feels that it did land or almost land.  She also said that they did not see the object leave because she ran in into house after it went below the roof level and did not look anymore. I asked if there was any adverse reactions by the animals in the area when the object was in view and Susan said that dogs on the other streets were going wild when the object came down close to the ground. The second witness was then contacted for his comments on the report.  Jeff F., a 45-year old disabled resident of Amelia, states that at 2:58 a.m. on Jan 12th, 2004, he and Susan were sitting in his truck in her driveway when they spotted the object hovering up over behind Susan\'s house.  The object was up very high. They watched as this object began to drop very fast.  It then stopped and hovered and then dropped again.  This all happened very quickly.  Jeff F. states that he looked away for a second and the light was back up in the sky in the same spot where they first saw it.  It dropped and stopped again.  This happened two times.  Jeff F. says he does not know how big the object was but it had a slowly rotating red light on top. I asked if there were other lights and Jeff said that he did not see any other lights nor could he tell the shape.  He said they watched this object for an hour while they sat in his truck. Jeff said this object eventually began to descend behind Susan\'s house.  Just as it went out of view a very weird thing happened.  Jeff F. said that a ""light tannish brown shadow that turned into a ball about the size of a cantaloupe"" rolled down Susan\'s roof. ""This happened so fast it was unbelievable,"" he said. When this happened both became frightened and Susan ran in the house. Both parties told me that there was a garbage truck coming down the street at the time the object was in view but they do not think the garbage man saw the UFO.   INVESTIGATORS COMMENT Jeff F. and Susan\'s stories differ in some aspects.  Both witnesses sounded sincere in their claims.  Susan still sounds upset about what she saw and expressed to me that she has received little sleep since her sighting.  I find the incident with the ""shadow"" very curious.  Both people expressed to me that it was ""something"" other then just a shadow, but ""shadow"" was the only word they could find to describe it.  It seems that this ""shadow"" upset both witnesses the most because the object was too far away to cast any reflection on the roof.` Susan is a 21 year old student at the University of Cincinnati.  She is out of school for the winter but will be back in school for the spring term.  She is taking courses (30-hours per week) to be become an RN. 45-year old Jeff F. is now disabled but was formerly employed as an industrial engineer. Susan informed me that she sometimes has trouble sleeping and she and Jeff F. will sit in his truck to talk so as not to wake her family.  That night they had spotted the UFO. Susan says the object was in the western skies when she first saw it. She says she does not know or could comment on how high the object was, saying she is not very good at judging distances. Jeff also said he could not guess on how high up this object was in darkness. ADDITIONAL WITNESS Through various telephone inquires of neighboring residents in the area contact was made with one other possible witness. A resident from a few blocks away (Eiler Rd) spoke with me by phone (name and phone number on file, withheld from this report) and said that around 3:30 a.m. on Monday morning, January 12, she looked out her window towards the West and saw a bright light in the vicinity of State Route 222.  She did not know how high this object was but said it was a very big bright light above the trees. She said that from her perspective, the object was in a westerly direction toward the lake (East Fork).  She could not give a clear estimate of elevation but claimed to have watched this object for a couple of minutes. After it allegedly disappeared she went back to bed.The time and date of the claimed sighting, plus general location of the alleged object, matches detail furnished by the first two witnesses from Yelton St. INVESTIGATION I contacted the Clermont County Sheriff\'s Dept. at 513-732-2231.  No UFO sightings were reported to them during this time frame. Next, I contacted the Bethel Police Dept. at 513-734-2256.  No UFO sightings were reported during this time to them. Additionally, researcher Kenny young placed a call to the Clermont Sun Newspaper ""465 E. Main St., Batavia, Ohio, 513-732-2511.""  He spoke with the editor, Art Hunter.  He was told they had not heard of any UFO sightings. Next, Young contacted the office at East Fork Lake State Park 513-734-4323.  The telephone receptionist, Sandy, said she was completely unfamiliar with UFO sightings around the East Fork State Park vicinity.  She did inquire about the witnesses.  She explained that she would pass the information along to the supervisor, others in the office and the park rangers who patrol the lake at night.  She took Young\'s telephone number and e-mail address and attached them to her report.  Young said if anyone had information about this story to feel free to contact him. http://home.fuse.net/ufo/eastfork04.htmlFiled 1/13/04 Donnie Blessing Southern Ohio State Section Director MUFON ', 'California - Airline Pilot Sights a UFO SAN FRANCISCO -- An airline transport pilot with 14 years\' experience in commercial aviation can\'t quite explain what he saw at 11 PM,  November 3, 2004.  The jetliner P.A. was flying was making its approach into San Francisco.   The jetliner was approaching the city from the east, passing just north of Stockton, when P.A. received instructions from the tower to descend from 35,000 to 24,000 feet (10,500 to 7,200 meters).  And then it happened.        ""While approaching San Francisco from the east,"" he reported, ""an orange dot began to glow and seemed to flash higher up to the west of us.  I thought that it was a planet.  It then changed color from orange to white.  Again, I thought a planet could be illuminated through a (local) atmosphere that would explain the color change.""   ""It then began to move in a northeasterly direction.  Once again, being in an airplane, it is very easy to think an object is moving, from small corrections the autopilot makes.  I found a handful of stars to serve as a reference point and verified that the object was slowly moving north.   It moved about 30 degrees and then stopped.  Then, it made a slight tangent to the right and continued moving for about 20 more degrees.""  ""It stopped and turned again to the right and continued for 10 degrees, then stopped again and disappeared."" ""The whole sighting ran about two minutes or so from start to finish. It was difficult to judge the actual distance and speed.  When I talk about \'moving in degrees and turning,\' I am talking about my (cockpit) viewpoint and compass degrees.""  ""The UFO\'s size was very small, about the size of the stars and planets you see in the sky.""   ""We had initially been at 35,000 feet (10,500 meters) but had descended to 24,000 feet (7,200 meters) when we saw the object.

Very strange, unexplainable lights appeared to hover low in the sky. Multiple witnesses saw the phenomenon, it was caught on camera, and it was captured on video by two separate witnesses. At approximately 8:30pm, the UFOs reached Pascoe Vale. It was then, that they appeared before the residence of Mark and Janine Blease. These witnesses were smart enough to grab their video camera. The Blease family captured one of the most mysterious pieces of UFO video evidence ever to claim the imagination of the folks from the land down under. Eleven witnesses were interviewed in total. Video footage, testimony, and photographic evidence all corroborated the sighting. The formation was moving over Melbourne while the video was taken at a location near Pascoe Vale. The objects were in two groups of three lights and each group was in a triangle formation.The video was taken by Mark & Janine Blease of Melbourne. PRA have a copy of the video for analysis and so does Channel 7 TV Melbourne. A check of Melbourne Air Traffic Control, show no aircraft at that location or in formation at that time and no radar contact was reported.On the Breakfast Show - Radio station 3AW Melbourne, spoke to the couple who took the video and they said it was quite a surprise and very spectacular, offering no explanation. Other people called the radio station and some did come onto the 'talk-back' line to support the sighting.This is a multiple witness event and a hoax has been ruled out. At present there is no simple explanation, however an investigation has now been opened and as more information becomes available we will post it."", 'Huge Triangular Object Sighted in Tennessee 2004Witness reported that at 05:30 hours this morning he was driving home when he noted what first appeared to be a fire on a ridge nearby. As he drove, he got closer to the ""fire"" and realized that it was not a fire at all but a series of three reddish orange lights affixed to the bottom of a huge triangular object. He neared an intersection and exited his car to watch the metallic craft as it approached from the north and moving directly toward him. He noted his fear and started to run from his car but realized that there was nowhere to go. As the giant object passed overhead, it blocked out all the stars and he estimated the size to be some 300 feet in length. The bottom of the craft was somewhat illuminated from the three flame-like, symmetrical appendages on the bottom and he described what appeared to be ""ribs"" running across the bottom of the object. As it passed directly overhead, he was exposed to something which seemed to reverberate through his body. He stated that he felt many sensations all at once, but no description could be found for what he actually felt. He also noted the object made a pulsating/drumming-like noise which also passed throughout his body.The object passed him and suddenly turned west, without banking and moved behind nearby hills.At this time MUFON Tennessee has determined that the possibility exists that this witness may have been injured by this ""CE-2"", or close encounter case. Witness has reported a metallic taste in his mouth today and nose bleeds. This may or may not be related to this close encounter.Update:This preliminary report will be revised and edited as information becomes available.Remember, this is only the preliminary findings and must be investigated fully before any determinations are made.It should be also noted that this witness is a MUFON member and 100% honest and trustworthy.UPDATE! 10-04-04Witness visited Shaffer for an interview. He is sick, his face and back are slightly burned, his hair is falling out. He had a nose-bleed and has a metallic taste in his mouth.He wants to go to the emergency room but does not know what to tell them happened to him. I fear he may have been exposed to some kind of exotic radiation.UPDATE! 10-06-04Today DR Mel Redfern, DCH (my assistant state director for MUFON TN) and myself conducted a more in depth interview of the witness in the Oct 2nd triangle sighting case. It now appears that this is a missing time case as well, noting that the witness admitted that his watch had lost 15 minutes (at least) and that it is a fairly dependable watch prior to the event and afterwards, having never lost any time before.The medical condition seems to have improved for now as his face and back are no longer burning like they were and his lethargic state seems to have passed. He has suffered no more nosebleeds or after effects.The case will be ongoing until all aspects have addressed fully.

1985, ,"['1985, Bob White UFO Encounter, Grand Junction, COMan finds tough sell for his ""UFO discovery.""  REEDS SPRING, Mo. — Bob White is convinced his story deserves a grand stage, that his most prized possession should be displayed before a national audience. It should draw tourists from all over the country, he figures, and be a major attraction for people who want to see an artifact that White swears was retrieved from a UFO in 1985. Instead, White\'s find is in tiny Reeds Spring in southwestern Missouri, secured in a locked display case at Museum of the Unexplained, a converted video-rental store that, during a recent morning, went more than three hours without a customer. White can\'t figure it out. All he wants to do is find some believers. He wants people to quit snickering and looking at him as if he\'s crazy. He wants them to listen to his story, to take a hard look at his metallic artifact, to give him a chance. ""This,"" White said, ""is the most difficult thing I\'ve ever done in my life."" The odds are stacked against him. He and his partner at the museum, Robert Gibbons, have been rejected and ridiculed. White estimates he has spent more than $60,000 traveling to conferences, starting the museum, having the artifact tested and retested. And yet he forges on. ""I\'m 73 years old,"" White said. ""I don\'t have much longer. ""What I\'d like to see before I\'m gone is the national media get their heads out of their ... "" White paused, choosing his words carefully, ""out of the sand. I\'d like to see the national media and everybody else realize that what I have is real."" Scientists theorize that the ""UFO"" lights that White said he encountered could have been nothing more than a meteorite, that his artifact could be space debris. Some scientists who have tested the object said there was nothing extraterrestrial about it. Ask White whether he believed in unidentified flying objects prior to 1985, and he scrunches up his nose. ""Never,"" he said. ""Not a bit. I was the biggest skeptic in the world."" That all changed overnight. Here\'s how he remembers it: White and a friend were driving from Denver to Las Vegas on a desolate highway near the Colorado-Utah border. It was 2 or 3 a.m., he said, and White was sleeping in the passenger seat. At one point, his friend woke him up and pointed out a strange light in the distance. White didn\'t think much of it and went back to sleep. Then his friend woke him up again. This time, White said, the lights were blinding. He got out of the car and stared, dumbfounded. The object was about 100 yards in front of him, he said, ""and it was huge ... absolutely huge."" In time, he said, the lights bolted toward the sky and connected with a pair of neon, tubular lights — ""the mother ship,"" White guesses now. And just like that, he said, the entire contraption zipped eastward through the Colorado sky and disappeared. ""What I saw,"" White said, ""was not of this Earth."" As the craft flew away, White said, he noticed an orange light falling to the ground. A locator probe? Something that simply broke off? It was red hot when he reached it, he said, but in time it cooled enough to pick up. White shoved the object into the trunk of the car. The object is about 7-1/2 inches long and shaped like a teardrop. It has a coarse, metallic exterior and weighs less than 2 pounds. It looks a bit like it could be a petrified pine cone and is composed primarily of aluminum. White has had the item tested several times, hoping for some answers. The Nevada-based National Institute for Discovery Science in 1996 sent a sample of the object to the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. ""The metallurgical analysis was pretty mundane,"" said Colm Kelleher, a scientist at the National Institute for Discovery Science. ""We didn\'t find any evidence that it was extraterrestrial. Now you can make the argument that we didn\'t spend $1 million and look at every conceivable option. We didn\'t cover every base."" Another scientist who tested it at a California laboratory — and who asked that his name and that of the laboratory not be used — said, ""It didn\'t show any extraterrestrial signature."" Sgt. Gary Carpenter, who works at the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado Springs, Colo., said it was not uncommon for NORAD to get calls about strange lights and unidentified objects. Not once, he said, has the object been identified as an alien spacecraft. ""Usually it turns out to be space debris from a satellite that\'s decaying, or it\'s in the realm of naturally occurring, celestial lights,"" he said. ""It could be something like a falling star. It could be contrails, the things you would see trailing an aircraft."" White opened the Museum of the Unexplained with visions of turning it into a destination. He wasn\'t looking to get rich — according to the Missouri secretary of state\'s office, the museum was registered as a nonprofit organization in August 2000 — but he hoped to spread the word about his experience. The museum, about 13 miles north of the glitzy Branson strip, might as well be in another world. There are no neon signs pointing the way, no twinkling lights outside the front door. Rather, it\'s sandwiched between the Humane Society thrift shop and the Sunrise Cafe on Main Street. It has struggled, unable to tap into the Branson spinoff crowd and secure a niche audience of its own. Only 2,800 people went through the doors that first year, when admission was free, and the museum hasn\'t been able to replicate those numbers since. These days, patrons age 12 and older pay $5 to stroll through about 2,000 square feet of space. Exhibits include a keyboard from the movie ""Men in Black II"" in which the shift key doesn\'t capitalize or decapitalize but translates from English to an alien language. Other exhibits are little more than newspaper articles or passages from the Internet affixed to the wall with thumb tacks. The focal point is White\'s artifact, and he takes no chances with its safety. Motion detectors, closed-circuit TV and window and door alarms protect it at all times. White packs it up in a gun case every day at 5 p.m., and the object never spends the night at the same place two nights in a row. You can never be too sure, he figures, even in a town with just 465 residents. ""I\'m happy for them that they\'re having a good time, but I guess I\'m just not into that kind of thing,"" said Kacee Cashman, the Reeds Spring city clerk since 1998. ""I really think they\'ve been accepted, but everybody\'s kind of taking it with a grain of salt."" Said White, ""I don\'t know what I have to do to prove this is the truth. You can\'t make this stuff up.""source:The Seattle TimesBy Steve RockKnight Ridder Newspapers', 'Man Confronted With Occupants In Craft 1985Date: August 1985-Time: 7:00pm-Location: Mayfair-Witnesses: familyA gentleman called to relate an experience he and his family had back in 1985.

His well known book,  ""Communion"" is a UFO classic. It was also made into a movie by the same name. In upper state New York over the 1985 Christmas holidays, Strieber was staying in his isolated cabin with his wife and son. At this time, Strieber was already a well know writer. He had become somewhat suspect of potential intruders, and had recently installed a high tech alarm system in the cabin.At approximately 11:00 PM on the 26th of December, he activated the system, and the family retired for the night. After a couple of hours, he was awakened by an unusual sound. He felt that the security of his cabin had been breached. He was soon shocked to see a creature in his bedroom.After this, the next thing he knew he was sitting in the woods which surrounded his cabin. His memories of what had occurred were fragmented. Eventually, to reestablish memories of that night, and understand what had really happened, he would undergo regressive hypnosis by Dr. Donald F. Klein.The hypnotic regression would uncover many of the details of his experience. He recalled that he had been ""floated"" out of his bedroom and into a waiting UFO. He would see four different types of alien beings, one a small, robot type of being, secondly, a short, stocky type, the third was very slender and weak looking. It had mesmerising black eyes that slanted, and the last being had black, button eyes.He was subjected to medical testing by these aliens. One of these was the insertion of a needle into his brain, and another involved an object being inserted into his rectum. The beings took a blood sample from him by making an incision in his finger.The recounting of the most bizarre facts, caused Dr. Klein to diagnose Strieber with ""temporal lobe epilepsy."" This condition can cause one to have hallucinations. Strieber did not accept the diagnosis, and recounted his abduction as a real event. He would eventually establish a foundation as a support group for alien abductees.source and references:Whitley Streiber, ""Communion""http://www.unknowncountry.com/', '1985-Close Encounter on Interstate 84, Connecticut In the past, the state of Connecticut has always been an area of few UFO reports, however this is no longer true. Since 1985 the counties of Fairfield and Litchfield and Hartford has seen a dramatic rise in the number of UFO reports. This UFO is described as being a semi circle or boomerang with multi-colored lights. Even more incredible the size of this UFO has been reported to be the length of a football field!.  This UFO that has been seen recently in Connecticut is without a doubt the Hudson valley UFO which is described in my book Night Seige The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings (Ballantine Books 1987).  For some reason unknown to this researcher the giant boomerang UFO has shifted it\'s activities from New York to Nearby Connecticut. The most recent sightings took place on May 26 of this year around interstate 84 one of the most heavily traveled highways in the northeast.  Between 9;30 and 10;15 PM more than 200 people phoned local and state police to report a huge object with bright lights flying low over the highway near the towns of Newtown and Southbury in Connecticut. Those witnesses that called state police in Southbury were told that it was nothing more than a group of Ultra light aircraft from Candlewood airport flying in close formation and hanging colored lanterns from the bottom of the plane. The police also told witnesses that the aircraft were painted black so that all that can be seen is the lights. Many of the witnesses to the phenomenon found it very hard to believe the official explanation.  One witnesses to the UFO was Mrs. Betty Proulx of Middlebury who said that the object hovered over her house without a sound for over two minutes.here was no doubt in her mind that what she was looking at was one solid object.When Mr. Proulx heard about the explanation he could not accept it since he was in the air division of the Navy. ""It was one craft and like no aircraft that I have ever seen in my life"".  Another witnesses was Mr. Randy Etting a commercial airline pilot with over thirty years of experience. Mr. Etting said that the idea of the ultra light theory ""is the prattling of idiots"" Mr. Etting observed the lights from his home in Newtown Connecticut at about 9:45 PM. He said that there were at least eight lights of different colors flying very close together and without a sound. As the object passed his home he observed it in a pair of 7 X 35 binoculars. Mr. Etting told me that the UFO was one object and he saw some type of heat waves coming from the object which distorted the area around the lights. Mr. Etting watched the object with neighbors and his son for over ten minutes as it slowly drifted to the north west. All the witnesses agree that the UFO was one solid object and round in appearance.  The Etting party was observing the UFO while it was passing close to I-84. At this time over a dozen cars pulled over to view the UFO as it passed overhead. One witness a Charlie Tuperman described what happened that night.  ""It was about 9:30 or so and I was driving East on 84 around the Southbury area when I noticed these lights ahead of me. They were low and it looked like a 747 was going to land on the highway.This thing had about ten lights in kind of a half circle and the lights were yellow, green, blue, white and red. This thing was going very slow and moving from the east to the west. All of a sudden every one on both sides of the road began slamming on their brakes and pulling over to the side. It was a dangerous thing to do since there were several trucks apparently trying the same thing. I pulled over and watched this thing pass directly over the west bound lanes. I saw a dark mass behind the lights and there was no sound. I saw the lights of a state trooper just ahead of me and I figured he was called to see what was going on. Then all of a sudden this thing gets real bright, I mean all the lights just got ten times brighter for about ten seconds or so, then they faded to where they were before and that is about as bright as a planes wing lights. That really scared me. I wanted to get going because I thought there was some type of invasion or something,I just wanted to get home. Besides I was afraid of some trucker plowing into my car. I watched it head west and lost it . I turned on the radio for news, but didn\'t hear anything about any UFOs on any of the local stations"".  Close Encounter in New Milford  At about 10:00 after the series of sightings in the I-84 area. The UFO was seen heading to the west. It was then seen in the New Milford Connecticut area by a Robert Nellis his friend Jeff and Mr. Nellis dog. They were all in Nellis car off a side road off Route 7 in the northern area of New Milford. They were driving home after a long day of boating upstate along the Connecticut river.The dog began to bark and cry and at that point Jeff looked over to the northeast to see a number of bright lights hovering over a stand of pine trees less than a quarter mile away. They stopped the car and at that time their car radio began to sound ""funny"" with all types of strange sounding static that interfered with the station that they were listening to.  They stopped the car and continued to watch the lights. At this moment the lights began to move slowly towards them. They were amazed at the size of the object, ""larger than a football field"". The dog continued to bark as the object passed over their car . Neil looked up and saw a very dark structure connecting the lights that extended toward the rear of the object. He said it was teardrop in shape and the lights in the front were in a half circle.The object was so large he said that"" it covered the sky and blocked out everything overhead""  The object he said was made of some type of ""dark grey material with very little reflect ability"". There was no sound and they estimated that the giant UFO was no more than 500 feet above their car. The UFO then passed over their car and then shifted towards the north. They both noticed some type of flashing lights under the object that gave the impression as if something was moving. They watched the UFO slowly move away. The total duration of the sighting was ten minutes, however both men arrived home forty minutes later. This is could be a case of missing time, or the witnesses observed the object longer than they thought.  Neil would call me for several days after my interview with him since he felt ""uneasy and upset"" about his Close Encounter. My research team and I are still investigating this case and it seems that it may be another of the many missing time cases that are escalating in the area. Photographic Proof  This UFO was so bright and large that it was only a matter of time before someone would come forward with a photograph. To our surprise we were contacted by a person of high standing in the Southbury area who took a picture of the object as it moved very slowly over I-84 at about 9:30 PM. The photographer wishes to remain anonymous since his position is very sensitive. He his a very highly trained college educated man who fears that the publicity surrounding the photograph could hurt his career. He gave us full rights to the photograph and his sighting account providing we do not use his real name. We will refer to him as David. (This person was actually Randy Etting; B J) David was on I-84 on Official business when he saw the lights. The lights were in the northwest and heading east. As he watched, the object tilted and all the lights got much brighter.He was pulled off the road at the time and had his camera ready. The UFO was about 45 degrees above the horizon. Due to traffic he had time to take only one picture. His camera was a 35 mm with a 50 mm lens at 1.8, the film type was Kodacolor ASA 400 and the exposure was 1/60th of a second, or 1/125.  He was not sure of the setting, but feels it was 1/60th of a second. The object then moved toward the east without a sound. During an interview with this researcher, David told me that the he was sure there was a solid object behind the lights. He also said that when the object turned it looked like the lights on the sides were pulling out from the main mass, but he realized that this effect was due to the object changing position from his point of view.  What about the Photo:  Several photo-analysis experts are now looking at the photograph. Our initial study showed that the image is without a doubt hanging in the sky above the ground. Also the photograph was looked at by Dr. Willy Smith a scientists and UFO researcher of some repute. Dr. Smith\'s initial calculations show the object to be anywhere from 650-1600 across!  We believe that this photograph is one of the best nighttime UFO pictures taken in the past twenty years. There were quite a few witnesses to the sighting over a twenty-five mile radius, all reporting the same thing. A close examination of the original negative shows that the lights are reflecting off of some type of structure in the central part of the object.Also the lights are in a perfect half circle. There is no doubt that what ever the UFO photograph represents it is one solid object. We hope to get more data on the photograph and the sightings in the weeks to come. I have taken an add in the local papers asking for videos and photographs and sighting accounts from that night.  A Rational Explanation?  What about the theory that the UFO is nothing more than Ultra lights from Candlewood airport. We questioned state police on this theory. An officer stated that they made a mistake about the airport, it wasn\'t Candlewood but Stormville airport. A flight instructor at Stormville later told us that there is only one Ultra light at Stormville and it only flies in the day since it is illegal for them to fly at night.  The UFO sightings in the Northeast continue. In the days to follow I received several calls from witnesses who saw formations of military helicopters in the sighting area. One witnesses took a picture of this formation. Is the government involved in the mysterious happenings over the Connecticut area? Many of the residents feel that the government is well aware of the UFO and is doing its best to play down the sightings by explaining them away.  I called nearby Bradley international airport to find out if they had any information about the sightings. I was informed by air traffic control that no formations or large aircraft were tracked on radar at that location and time.  I was also told that unless the ""aircraft"" have transponders (a device placed in aircraft that helps identify them on radar) in them they would not be picked up at that location at an altitude of less than 2,000 feet. I have enough witnesses in different locations at the same time observing the UFO to determine that the approximate altitude was between 1,000 and 1300 feet.  Based on this information my calculations indicate that the span of lights was at least 900 feet! Its apparent size in the sky was quite large, this is evident by the image on the 35 mm frame that takes up almost half the negative.  It is obvious from the photograph and by the witness statements that something more than ultra light aircraft was in the sky over Connecticut that night. source:Philip J.

A ""blob"" shot out and downward from the light, and projected a cone of brilliant (greenish?) light at the ground below. Two additional beams appeared, and features on the ground could be seen to be illuminated. One beam then swung around and illuminated the aircraft cabin. The light appeared to approach and resolved into a greenish luminosity as much as several degrees in extent, which then paralleled their course. ""There were multiple lights of different colors and fiery zig-zags that crossed the vapor.""It lit up like a Christmas tree.""At this point, the aircraft was coming within range of the ground controller, who could then also see the object. The object seemed to change shape. ""It developed an \'appendage\' and then \'became\' a \'wingless cloud-aircraft with a pointed tail\' (the spike?). The yellow and green glow, like phosphorescence, was eerily intertwined"". A second aircraft was vectored nearby and also could see the object near the first aircraft.

1000, ,"[""Triangular Hovering Object over Ft. Smith, Arkansas, '67 or '68I wonder why I never hear anything about this event. It's like it never happened and at least 500 people (probably more than 1000) witnessed it. We were outside our home at ((street number deleted)) North 36th in Fort Smith, Arkansas. My mother, father and myself were there. Our neighbors were in their front yards. Suddenly in the sky a triangular shaped object appeared right above our home not 100 yards (app.) above us. It had three lights on it with one on each corner. We all saw it at the same time, as did many people over the whole city of Fort Smith, Arkansas. The radio station started reporting on it after many calls. A well-known preacher in Fort Smith was praying about it, and the radio station had everyone gather at the Pepsi or Coca Cola bottling plant and there were at least 1000 people gathered there who had seen the object/objects all over the city. The preacher also was there and it was quite an event. It was in the news for a couple of days, and then some hokey story about a weather balloon was released and suddenly the story was cold. In the past few years I have spoken to people who did see it and remember it well, and we all remember the event and wish we knew more about it. The craft we saw could move very suddenly very fast and just stop and hover in the air. No one had ever seen anything like it. Last year, I heard from a man who had been stationed at Fort Chaffee (just southeast of the city) who was looking for people who remembered the event. He said he had never gotten it out of his mind. He is out of the service now and lives in Florida. I would love to know if anyone has reported this at this website or remembers it as I do. My sister was in Oklahoma at the time and she and her boyfriend saw it from the bridge that leads from Oklahoma into Fort Smith. Would love to hear more from anyone about this event. The date may not be correct, but it was around that time. By the way, many people reported that the lights changed colors on the craft. Source & References:www.nuforc.org""]"
1955, ,"['The 1955 Bexleyheath UFO Encounter On July 17, 1955, an unidentified flying object was spotted in the Bexleyheath area by several people.Now a former policeman is doing research on the sightings. Two Bexley men, both now in their 60s, have recently been reliving their own X-Files experiences from their childhood.Rodney Maynard, from Belvedere, who is now 62, has contacted the News Shopper to reveal he was one of the youngsters who saw the UFO featured in our September 4 edition.Retired policeman John Hanson, from the West Midlands, was appealing for a group of children who saw the craft land in the King Harold\'s Way area of Bexleyheath in 1955 to get in touch with him, as he is researching the incident for a book.Mr Maynard was 15 at the time and was working as a labourer on a building site in nearby Streamway.He remembers the incident vividly.""We were on our lunch break when we heard something was happening in King Harold\'s Way. So we went up there to have a look.""This thing had landed in the roadway. It took up the whole width of the road and overlapped onto the pavements.""It wasn\'t on the ground, it had about eight massive suckers. The centre was still, but the outer rim was spinning slowly and it had white lights flashing, like a camera flash,"" he recalled.""There were about 30 of us staring at it. We could hear it humming.""It had what looked like windows but the glass was concave and moulded together so you couldn\'t see in. A couple of us went forward to try and touch it and it began to spin faster.""Then it lifted slowly off the ground and hovered above our heads, tilting slightly.""The craft moved slowly until it was over Bedonwell Primary School, where it stayed for about a minute, then shot up into the sky and disappeared.Mr Maynard, whose 16-year-old brother also saw the craft said: ""It was black, sleek and streamlined with a surface like polished metal. It was very fine and beautiful. It certainly wasn\'t a prank.""He went on: ""I have never forgotten it but I don\'t talk about it because people would think you were barmy.""We used to talk about it among ourselves but our mums kept telling us we hadn\'t seen anything.""As well as his brother, Mr Maynard listed several other pals who were also there: ""Ron Deadman, Tony Savin, Vic Clarke, Tommy Staggs, we were all there.""Ken Fairman knows just how he feels.Mr Fairman, from Bexleyheath, says he saw a very similar craft with his pal Roy Beadle three years before, in 1952.They were out walking Ray\'s dog at an old farmstead in Bexleyheath known as The Warren (now the Warren Road area).""It was late afternoon. We had just come home from Bexleyheath School and we had Ray\'s young border collie with us. We saw it come down and hover about 18ft above the ground. There was no noise at all. We threw ourselves down on the ground and watched it. The dog which was young and usually lively, lay down between us. We lost all track of time.""It was about 20 or 30ft wide, with terrifically bright white lights underneath. It looked very similar to the drawing in your September 4 issue. Then it shot off and disappeared from view before you could click your fingers.""I could still take you to the exact spot. I don\'t know how long we watched for but I got told off for being late home for tea. I told my parents but they thought I was crackers.""Margaret Fry was also a witness to this UFO encounter.Margaret, who lived in Hythe Avenue, was making her way to her doctor\'s surgery. She and the doctor, Dr Thukarta, both saw what she described as an ""enormous craft"" hovering over the doctor\'s car. She described the craft as saucer-shaped with a ""blue/silver/grey/pewter texture, yet, none of those colours."" Mrs Fry said it also had what looked like three spheres inset into its base, one of which ""flopped out"", landing on the ground at the junction of nearby Ashbourne and Whitfield Road. A group of twelve children who were playing nearby saw it and went over to have a closer look, before it rose up from the ground and into the sky, disappearing from sight after a few minutes. Dr Thukarta died in 1965,  but Mr. Hanson has spoken at length to Mrs Fry, who now lives in North Wales, about her experience. 4:14 pm Monday 16th September 2002Also see 1955 UFO Landing at Bexleysource:By Linda Piperhttp://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/bromley/display.var.625555.index.0.html ', ' 1955 - US Senators See Flying Saucers In Soviet Russia One of the most powerful U.S. senators in modern history actually eye-witnessed two UFOs while on a fact-finding trip through Russia in 1955, and the U.S. government kept the sightings a secret for more than three decades.  The incredible encounter is detailed in 12 TOP SECRET CIA, FBI, and Air Force reports-and declassified in 1985.  Those startling reports reveal that Senator Richard B. Russell, Jr. (D-GA), then chairman of the Armed Services Committee-was on a Soviet train when he spotted a disc-shaped craft taking off near the tracks.  He hurriedly called his military aide and interpreter to the window and they saw the UFO, plus another one that appeared a minute later. The astonished trio reported the sightings to the U.S. Air Force as soon as they were out of Russia.   ""The three observers were firmly convinced that they saw a genuine flying disc,"" says an Air Force Intelligence report, dated October 14, 1955, and classified TOP SECRET at the time.  Senator Russell served 38 years in the Senate.  He was its senior, and one of the most influential senators at the time of his death in 1971.  He was chairman of the Armed Services Committee from 1951 to 1969, and unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1952.  The  mind-boggling documents detailing his UFO encounter were made available by the Fund for UFO Research and its chaiman, Dr. Bruce Maccabee.  Several key documents were obtained by the group through the Freedom of Information Act.  ""These long secret documents are of major importance because they show for the first time that one of the most powerful U.S. Senators witnessed and reported a UFO,"" said Dr. Maccabee.   The Air Force Intelligence report says Russell and his two traveling companions spotted the UFOs on October 4, 1955, while traveling by rail across Russia\'s Transcaucasus region.  ""One disc ascended almost vertically, at a relatively slow speed, with its outer surface revolving slowly to the right, to an altitude of about 6000 feet, where its speed then increased sharply as it headed north,"" the report states.  ""The second flying disc was seen performing the same actions about one minute later. The take-off area was about 1-2 miles south of the rail line.""   Russell ""saw the first flying disc ascend and pass over the train,"" and went ""rushing in to get Mr Efron (Ruben Efron, his interpreter) and Col. Hathaway (Col. E. U. Hathaway, his aide) to see it,"" the report said.  ""Col. Hathaway stated that he got to the window with the Senator in time to see the first (UFO), while Mr. Efron said that he got only a short glimpse of the first.  However, all three saw the second disc and all agreed that they saw the same round, disc-shaped craftas the first.""  The Air Force report was written by Lieut. Col. Thomas Ryan, who interviewed Senator Russell\'s companions in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on October 13, after they arrived there from Russia shortly after the sighting.   In his report, Col. Ryan called the sightings ""an eyewitness account of the ascent and flight of an unconventional craft by three highly reliable United States observers.  He added that Col. Hathaway led off his account of the sightings by saying:  ""I doubt if your going to believe this, but we all saw it.""  Senator Russell was the first to see this flying disc we\'ve been told for years that there isn\'t such a thing, but all of us saw it.""   CIA documents show that the agency later interviewed the three eyewitnesses in the Russell party and also a fourth person, unidentified in the reports, who had seen the UFOs.  An eyewitness, whose name was blacked out on the CIA report prior to its declassification, said one of the UFOs ""had a slight dome on top"" and also a ""white light on top.""  The edge of the disc was glowing pinkish-white, he added. The UFO rose ""vertically with the glow moving slowly around the perimeter in a clockwise direction, giving the appearance of a pinwheel.""   Interpreter Ruben Efron told the CIA that visibility was excellent.  As one UFO approached the train, he said, ""the object gave the impression of gliding.  No noise was heard and no exhaust was heard, and no exhaust glow or trail was seen by me.""  After the encounter, Senator Russell told the men with him:  ""We saw a flying disc.  I wanted you boys to see it so that I would have witnesses,"" according to the CIA documents.""  And an FBI memo, dated November 4, 1955, also discusses the sighting and admitted Col. Hathaway\'s testimony ""would support existence of a flying disc.""  Dr. Maccabee, of the Fund for UFO Research, believes that Senator Russell and his group never publicly revealed their incredible sightings ""because they were no doubt advised not to talk.  These documents provide startling new evidence that UFOs exist.""   Mr. Tom Towers, in his January 20, 1957, column, \'Aviation News,\' for the Los Angeles, CA, Examiner, printed the contents of a letter from Senator Russell, which was in response to a request for information about the sightings in Russia.  Mr. Towers had originally contacted Senator Russell\'s office by letter with the request that he be given permission to ""break"" the story.  The Senator wrote:  ""Permit me to acknowledge your letters relative to reports that have come to you regarding aerial objects seen in Europe last year.  I received your letter, but I have discussed this matter with the affected agencies of the government, and they are of the opinion that it is not wise to publicize this matter at this time.  I regret very much that I am unable to be of assistance to you."" The letter was dated 17 January, 1956. (Source: http://www.nuforc.org/LB5510.html ) ']"
1972, ,"['Alien Encounter at ISLA DE LOBOS, Uruguay, 10-28-1972By Dr. Willy Smith UFO TYPE: CE 3DATE: October 28, 1972TIME: 10:15 P.M.DURATION: 1 minuteWITNESSES: 1PLACE: Isla de Lobos, Uruguay35 deg. 1’ S.; 54 deg. 53’ W.  The Place-Isla de Lobos is a small island a few miles off the Uruguayan coast, just where the River Plate meets the Atlantic Ocean. Its name means literally “island of the fur seals”, as these animals roam freely, and it is a lonely place where the only outstanding feature is the lighthouse.The maintenance of this lighthouse is the responsibility of the Navy, and for that purpose a small garrison of 4 or 5 men is kept on the island. Their main task is to attend to the electric generators, as the actual operation of the beam is automatic. It is a routine and non-stressing job, and the tours of duty are 15 days in and 15 days out. The Incident-On the night of October 28, 1972, there were five men at the house which serves as headquarters for the Navy personnel: the witness, Corporal Juan Fuentes Figueroa; two enlisted men, Jose Gomez and Hector Gimenez; a telegraph operator, Jose Lima; and the sub-officer in charge, Francisco Cascudo. After dinner, the men sat around the table for a while, talking and playing cards, until at 10:10 PM it was time for Corporal Fuentes to inspect the generators, which are located at the base of the lighthouse proper.The lighthouse is a 66-meter-high tower sitting at the center of a large building which contains the electric generators, the telegraph office and other dependencies. The top of this building is a flat terrace, which is about 6 meters above the adjacent terrain . The house where the garrison lives is at a distance of 45 meters from the lighthouse.As soon as Cpt. Fuentes started to walk toward the lighthouse, he noticed on top of the terrace some lights that shouldn’t be there. In fact, he thought first of a car, a complete impossibility, and his reaction was to return to the house and procure a pistol that he had in his room. To do this, he didn’t have to pass through the kitchen where the other men were, so he didn’t speak to them. As will be discussed later, this behavior is typical of the personality of the witness.Carrying the pistol, he went outside again and started walking decisively but not fast toward the lighthouse, meanwhile removing the safety from the gun and cocking it. As he advanced, he noted that the object had several lights: some white, some yellowish, and a third color that he describes as violet, as in the “rainbow”. Those lights were sufficient to allow him a good view, and he saw that a figure was next to the object and that a second was in the process of descending. A third and taller figure started to descend almost at once, but at the same moment, the initial two figures noticed Fuentes progressing toward them. They had what appeared to Fuentes as a moment of communication, and all three of them faced him.By that time, Fuentes was at about 27 meters from the object, which, we will recall, was on the top of a 6-meter terrace. Hence, the object was above him, and he started to raise his extended arm to shoot. He was never to complete his motion, as the entities prevented him, from doing so. Fuente, a man of limited education, tried in vain to explain to the investigators how this was accomplished. It was not telepathy, and he felt some physical effects, like a “vibration” and his hair standing on end; but more than anything else it was like a premonition, in his words like: “Don’t shoot because it is useless”. At any rate, he felt paralyzed and confused, and was unable to shoot.The action continued rather fast: the entities reentered their craft, the tallest one first. Although Fuentes did not see steps or a handrail, he could see quite well the motion of the figures against the lights of the object, outlined by the light coming out through the open door. He is certain that there were steps, as while the entities were climbing up with their backs toward the witness, their motions were like those of a person pulling himself up with handrails.The door closed sideways, and the craft started to move straight up, emitting a humming sound until it reached about 45 meters, as judged by the adjacent lighthouse tower. It then tilted, belched a blinding fireball from the bottom, and disappeared in silence at a tremendous speed toward the southeast.The witness returned to the house, where the other men noticed him white as a paper and still with a gun in hand. When he said that he had seen a flying saucer, he was not believed, except perhaps by Sub-Officer Cascudo.Corporal Fuentes was rather upset that his equals and his immediate superiors were dubious of his story, and was planning when he returned to Montevideo to go to one of the leading newspapers and make his experience public. However, before this was accomplished, he was ordered to report to a higher ranking officer, who carefully listened to what Fuentes had to say. He then disappeared into an office in which two members of the personnel of the American Embassy had been waiting.According to Fuentes, they were officers of the “Spatial Affair Service”, (sic) and their presence in the Command Offices was not unusual. Fuentes was left waiting in the corridor, and after a while someone came out and offered him some drawings for inspection and asked him to select the one closest to what hi has seen. He did so and was dismissed. He never talked directly to the Americans, but from the conversation overheard through the door, he concluded that they were surprised at the short distance of Fuente’s observation. And I am amazed at the continuous interest shown by American Embassies in collecting information about a phenomenon that we have been told many times does not exist... Craft and Entities-While the whole incident lasted about one minute, Corporal Fuentes had the object in direct view for more than about 15 seconds. It was well illuminated by its own lights, and it was fortuitous that the external lights usually illuminating the exterior of the installations were not in operation that night. If the floodlights had been on, they would have prevented a clear view by the witness, even blinding him at the location of the observation. As things turned out, he observed the entities in the background light of their own craft, and even if this prevented him from seeing facial details, for example, their outline and motions were quite evident.When Corporal Fuentes started to walk toward the lighthouse, the first entity was already on the terrace, while the second was alighting from the craft. These two entities were about 1.50 m. (5 ft), while the third one, the last to descend, was 1.75-1.80 m. (6 ft). Thus, their heights were within the normal human limits . Their silhouettes were dark, as if they were wearing heavy black rubber suits. The witness attributed their slow and deliberate motions to the weight of their suits, and thinks that his presence surprised the strangers at the beginning of an operation never to be completed. Their descent from the craft was done backwards, as if using a ladder not seen by the witness. Likewise, when they climbed back into the object, their motions were those of a person pulling himself up using handrails.The most distinctive feature of the entities, clearly noticeable in the profile view that they offered to the witness, was the elongated shape of the back o their heads. It is not clear if this corresponds to the heads themselves, or it is was the result of some type of hood or garment.The craft itself had the shape of an inverted bowl, with a diameter of between 4 and 5 meters. It had a dome on top and a rectangular aperture or door, used by the entities to descend (Fig. 3). It also had legs, which the witness saw clearly during the first stage of the departure. as the craft was slowly gaining altitude. Those legs did not fold like the landing gear of a plane, but retracted telescopically.The surface of the craft was undoubtedly metallic, with a somewhat reddish color that Fuentes compared to mahogany. The most distinctive feature of the object was the antenna that topped it, shaped like a corkscrew and rotating.The lights have already been described, and it only is necessary to add that they seemed to Fuentes like “little squares”, moving and flashing like “an advertising sign”. The Witness-This is a single witness sighting, and yet it has become the best case coming from Uruguay due to the in-depth investigation done by the members of C.I.O.V.I.. This paper is based on the information contained in their report on this case. (Ref.1).The first stage of the investigation consisted of two lengthy interviews with the witness in his own home. The two interviews were recorded, and the transcripts do not reveal any discrepancies in the narrative.This was followed by an “in situ” reconstruction of the events. with the participation of the witness. Sub-officer Cascudo, present on the island that night, verified that the initial version by Corporal Fuentes was similar to the subsequent descriptions relayed later to the investigating team. Sub-officer Cascudo, as well as other superiors of Corporal Fuentes, described him as a “simple and honest man, incapable of inventing a story of this nature”.But indeed the most fascinating part of the CIOVI investigation was to request the assistance of a professional and to submit the witness to a battery of psychological tests that extended over a total of 9 hours, and that included, among others, Raven, Bender, Rorschach and PMK.The result of those various tests dwell on positive and negative aspects of the personality of the witness, but when analyzed in the light of the narrative presented by Corporal Fuentes, they complement each other and tend to lend credibility to the story.In what follows, the key elements of the psychological evaluation will be indicated with quotation marks, interspace with comments on how they relate to the particular facets of the case.First of all, the witness is described as “sincere, uncomplicated and simple”. He expresses what for him is the truth, and he does that in a straighrforward manner, with no cultural burden distiring what he has to say.The witness “has no tendency to fabrication or fantasy”, which if existing would damage his credibility. Moreover, he has “less that average intellectual capacity”, to which the psychologist adds that he “lacks an average imagination” and “has a remarkably poor knowledge of what is going on in the social environment”. All of these are pluses from the viewpoint of the credibility of the witness, and negate the possibility of him having created the whole story. And in fact, the investigators were able to determine that the ufological knowledge of the witness was practically non-existent.From the emotional viewpoint, the witness is typified as “insecure, prompt to react anxiously and even aggressively” to an unexpected situation. That is exactly what the witness did when confronted with the impossible presence of a car on the terrace: his first reaction was to arm himself, although he could not explain later to the investigators what he intended to do with the gun. But he was following his training, and thus bolstered his confidence.Another result of the psychological tests is that the witness has “a balanced psychic personality”, and it is “unlikely that he would confabulate by himself, unless an external event would upset him”. To summarize, his poor intellectual capacity and lack of imagination did not allow him to reason what was best to do when confronted with the unexpected, and instead of firing his gun or alerting his companions, he failed to do either, remaining paralyzed and confused. When he returned to the house, the other men noticed his trembling voice and his pale color, so there is no question that an external stimulus affected him deeply.The conclusion, then, is that the psychology and personality of the witness are such that his reactions and behavior under the circumstances are totally compatible. Therefore, the probability that the witness is telling the truth is very great.Of course, there is always an uncertainty about what percentage of the description of the witness corresponds to the physical reality of the object and the entities, but we can assert that in fact that Isla de Lobos is a remote place, moreover, a restricted area with difficult access, controlled by the Uruguayan Navy, and where no conventional explanations are viable, the inescapable conclusion is that this case is, using Dr. Maccabee’s coined word, a TRUFO.', 'Alien Encounter at ISLA DE LOBOS, Uruguay, 10-28-1972By Dr. Willy Smith UFO TYPE: CE 3DATE: October 28, 1972TIME: 10:15 P.M.DURATION: 1 minuteWITNESSES: 1PLACE: Isla de Lobos, Uruguay35 deg. 1’ S.; 54 deg. 53’ W.

Therefore, the probability that the witness is telling the truth is very great.Of course, there is always an uncertainty about what percentage of the description of the witness corresponds to the physical reality of the object and the entities, but we can assert that in fact that Isla de Lobos is a remote place, moreover, a restricted area with difficult access, controlled by the Uruguayan Navy, and where no conventional explanations are viable, the inescapable conclusion is that this case is, using Dr. Maccabee’s coined word, a TRUFO.', 'Alien Encounter at ISLA DE LOBOS, Uruguay, 10-28-1972By Dr. Willy Smith UFO TYPE: CE 3DATE: October 28, 1972TIME: 10:15 P.M.DURATION: 1 minuteWITNESSES: 1PLACE: Isla de Lobos, Uruguay35 deg. 1’ S.; 54 deg. 53’ W.  The Place-Isla de Lobos is a small island a few miles off the Uruguayan coast, just where the River Plate meets the Atlantic Ocean. Its name means literally “island of the fur seals”, as these animals roam freely, and it is a lonely place where the only outstanding feature is the lighthouse.The maintenance of this lighthouse is the responsibility of the Navy, and for that purpose a small garrison of 4 or 5 men is kept on the island. Their main task is to attend to the electric generators, as the actual operation of the beam is automatic. It is a routine and non-stressing job, and the tours of duty are 15 days in and 15 days out. The Incident-On the night of October 28, 1972, there were five men at the house which serves as headquarters for the Navy personnel: the witness, Corporal Juan Fuentes Figueroa; two enlisted men, Jose Gomez and Hector Gimenez; a telegraph operator, Jose Lima; and the sub-officer in charge, Francisco Cascudo. After dinner, the men sat around the table for a while, talking and playing cards, until at 10:10 PM it was time for Corporal Fuentes to inspect the generators, which are located at the base of the lighthouse proper.The lighthouse is a 66-meter-high tower sitting at the center of a large building which contains the electric generators, the telegraph office and other dependencies. The top of this building is a flat terrace, which is about 6 meters above the adjacent terrain . The house where the garrison lives is at a distance of 45 meters from the lighthouse.As soon as Cpt. Fuentes started to walk toward the lighthouse, he noticed on top of the terrace some lights that shouldn’t be there. In fact, he thought first of a car, a complete impossibility, and his reaction was to return to the house and procure a pistol that he had in his room. To do this, he didn’t have to pass through the kitchen where the other men were, so he didn’t speak to them. As will be discussed later, this behavior is typical of the personality of the witness.Carrying the pistol, he went outside again and started walking decisively but not fast toward the lighthouse, meanwhile removing the safety from the gun and cocking it. As he advanced, he noted that the object had several lights: some white, some yellowish, and a third color that he describes as violet, as in the “rainbow”. Those lights were sufficient to allow him a good view, and he saw that a figure was next to the object and that a second was in the process of descending. A third and taller figure started to descend almost at once, but at the same moment, the initial two figures noticed Fuentes progressing toward them. They had what appeared to Fuentes as a moment of communication, and all three of them faced him.By that time, Fuentes was at about 27 meters from the object, which, we will recall, was on the top of a 6-meter terrace. Hence, the object was above him, and he started to raise his extended arm to shoot. He was never to complete his motion, as the entities prevented him, from doing so. Fuente, a man of limited education, tried in vain to explain to the investigators how this was accomplished. It was not telepathy, and he felt some physical effects, like a “vibration” and his hair standing on end; but more than anything else it was like a premonition, in his words like: “Don’t shoot because it is useless”. At any rate, he felt paralyzed and confused, and was unable to shoot.The action continued rather fast: the entities reentered their craft, the tallest one first. Although Fuentes did not see steps or a handrail, he could see quite well the motion of the figures against the lights of the object, outlined by the light coming out through the open door. He is certain that there were steps, as while the entities were climbing up with their backs toward the witness, their motions were like those of a person pulling himself up with handrails.The door closed sideways, and the craft started to move straight up, emitting a humming sound until it reached about 45 meters, as judged by the adjacent lighthouse tower. It then tilted, belched a blinding fireball from the bottom, and disappeared in silence at a tremendous speed toward the southeast.The witness returned to the house, where the other men noticed him white as a paper and still with a gun in hand. When he said that he had seen a flying saucer, he was not believed, except perhaps by Sub-Officer Cascudo.Corporal Fuentes was rather upset that his equals and his immediate superiors were dubious of his story, and was planning when he returned to Montevideo to go to one of the leading newspapers and make his experience public. However, before this was accomplished, he was ordered to report to a higher ranking officer, who carefully listened to what Fuentes had to say. He then disappeared into an office in which two members of the personnel of the American Embassy had been waiting.According to Fuentes, they were officers of the “Spatial Affair Service”, (sic) and their presence in the Command Offices was not unusual. Fuentes was left waiting in the corridor, and after a while someone came out and offered him some drawings for inspection and asked him to select the one closest to what hi has seen. He did so and was dismissed. He never talked directly to the Americans, but from the conversation overheard through the door, he concluded that they were surprised at the short distance of Fuente’s observation. And I am amazed at the continuous interest shown by American Embassies in collecting information about a phenomenon that we have been told many times does not exist... Craft and Entities-While the whole incident lasted about one minute, Corporal Fuentes had the object in direct view for more than about 15 seconds. It was well illuminated by its own lights, and it was fortuitous that the external lights usually illuminating the exterior of the installations were not in operation that night. If the floodlights had been on, they would have prevented a clear view by the witness, even blinding him at the location of the observation. As things turned out, he observed the entities in the background light of their own craft, and even if this prevented him from seeing facial details, for example, their outline and motions were quite evident.When Corporal Fuentes started to walk toward the lighthouse, the first entity was already on the terrace, while the second was alighting from the craft. These two entities were about 1.50 m. (5 ft), while the third one, the last to descend, was 1.75-1.80 m. (6 ft). Thus, their heights were within the normal human limits . Their silhouettes were dark, as if they were wearing heavy black rubber suits. The witness attributed their slow and deliberate motions to the weight of their suits, and thinks that his presence surprised the strangers at the beginning of an operation never to be completed. Their descent from the craft was done backwards, as if using a ladder not seen by the witness. Likewise, when they climbed back into the object, their motions were those of a person pulling himself up using handrails.The most distinctive feature of the entities, clearly noticeable in the profile view that they offered to the witness, was the elongated shape of the back o their heads. It is not clear if this corresponds to the heads themselves, or it is was the result of some type of hood or garment.The craft itself had the shape of an inverted bowl, with a diameter of between 4 and 5 meters. It had a dome on top and a rectangular aperture or door, used by the entities to descend (Fig. 3). It also had legs, which the witness saw clearly during the first stage of the departure. as the craft was slowly gaining altitude. Those legs did not fold like the landing gear of a plane, but retracted telescopically.The surface of the craft was undoubtedly metallic, with a somewhat reddish color that Fuentes compared to mahogany. The most distinctive feature of the object was the antenna that topped it, shaped like a corkscrew and rotating.The lights have already been described, and it only is necessary to add that they seemed to Fuentes like “little squares”, moving and flashing like “an advertising sign”. The Witness-This is a single witness sighting, and yet it has become the best case coming from Uruguay due to the in-depth investigation done by the members of C.I.O.V.I.. This paper is based on the information contained in their report on this case. (Ref.1).The first stage of the investigation consisted of two lengthy interviews with the witness in his own home. The two interviews were recorded, and the transcripts do not reveal any discrepancies in the narrative.This was followed by an “in situ” reconstruction of the events. with the participation of the witness. Sub-officer Cascudo, present on the island that night, verified that the initial version by Corporal Fuentes was similar to the subsequent descriptions relayed later to the investigating team. Sub-officer Cascudo, as well as other superiors of Corporal Fuentes, described him as a “simple and honest man, incapable of inventing a story of this nature”.But indeed the most fascinating part of the CIOVI investigation was to request the assistance of a professional and to submit the witness to a battery of psychological tests that extended over a total of 9 hours, and that included, among others, Raven, Bender, Rorschach and PMK.The result of those various tests dwell on positive and negative aspects of the personality of the witness, but when analyzed in the light of the narrative presented by Corporal Fuentes, they complement each other and tend to lend credibility to the story.In what follows, the key elements of the psychological evaluation will be indicated with quotation marks, interspace with comments on how they relate to the particular facets of the case.First of all, the witness is described as “sincere, uncomplicated and simple”. He expresses what for him is the truth, and he does that in a straighrforward manner, with no cultural burden distiring what he has to say.The witness “has no tendency to fabrication or fantasy”, which if existing would damage his credibility. Moreover, he has “less that average intellectual capacity”, to which the psychologist adds that he “lacks an average imagination” and “has a remarkably poor knowledge of what is going on in the social environment”. All of these are pluses from the viewpoint of the credibility of the witness, and negate the possibility of him having created the whole story. And in fact, the investigators were able to determine that the ufological knowledge of the witness was practically non-existent.From the emotional viewpoint, the witness is typified as “insecure, prompt to react anxiously and even aggressively” to an unexpected situation. That is exactly what the witness did when confronted with the impossible presence of a car on the terrace: his first reaction was to arm himself, although he could not explain later to the investigators what he intended to do with the gun. But he was following his training, and thus bolstered his confidence.Another result of the psychological tests is that the witness has “a balanced psychic personality”, and it is “unlikely that he would confabulate by himself, unless an external event would upset him”. To summarize, his poor intellectual capacity and lack of imagination did not allow him to reason what was best to do when confronted with the unexpected, and instead of firing his gun or alerting his companions, he failed to do either, remaining paralyzed and confused. When he returned to the house, the other men noticed his trembling voice and his pale color, so there is no question that an external stimulus affected him deeply.The conclusion, then, is that the psychology and personality of the witness are such that his reactions and behavior under the circumstances are totally compatible. Therefore, the probability that the witness is telling the truth is very great.Of course, there is always an uncertainty about what percentage of the description of the witness corresponds to the physical reality of the object and the entities, but we can assert that in fact that Isla de Lobos is a remote place, moreover, a restricted area with difficult access, controlled by the Uruguayan Navy, and where no conventional explanations are viable, the inescapable conclusion is that this case is, using Dr. Maccabee’s coined word, a TRUFO.', '1972: Disc Lands near Nazca Peru On February 3, 1972, one of Peru\'s most famous UFO encounters took place. It happened in broad daylight and the saucer\'s alien occupant was seen by the two human witnesses.It all began early that morning in Puquilo, a desert town about 500 kilometers (300 miles) south of Lima. Tito Rojas and Adolfo Penafiel owned a feed store, and they had a delivery to make that day. So before the hot summer sun climbed too high in the cloudless blue sky, the men loaded up the flatbed of Tito\'s pickup truck and set out for Nazca, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the north.(Editor\'s Note: In Peru, as in other countries of the southern hemisphere, February is a summer month.)With the truck\'s windows rolled all the way down, hoping to catch a breeze off the Pacific Ocean, Tito and Adolfo drove north on the Pan-American Highway. On both sides of the road, a monocolor landscape of brown sand and jagged rocks met their gaze, with the rugged cordillera rising on their right.As they were crossing the desolate Pampa Carbonera south of Nazca, the truck\'s radio, which had been tuned to a station in Arequipa, began to act up. The Latino music faded in and out. Bursts of static obliterated the music. Finally, the radio started emitting just static, and then it went silent.""Not again!"" Tito said, and he thumped the dashboard with his right fist.""Maybe it\'s the antenna,"" Adolfo suggested.Suddenly, the pickup truck\'s engine began missing on all cylinders.""Now, what!?"" Tito swore, stepping down hard on the gas pedal.The engine raced, but the truck didn\'t respond. Swiveling the stickshift, Tito tried for a lower gear. The engine continued to sputter and cough. Finally, it quit completely, and Tito coasted over to the sandy shoulder of the highway.""It might be the gas filter,"" Adolfo said, as they left the truck\'s cab.""I think it\'s the battery,"" Tito replied, ""The radio is out. So is the door light. I hope it\'s a bad connection.""""Why do you say that?""""Because if we need water, we\'ve got enough,"" Tito said, gesturing at the leather bota (water jug--J.T.) dangling from the gunrack. But it will take all day and all night if it has to recharge by itself.""Lifting the hood (bonnet in UK--J.T.), Tito licked his thumb and pinky finger and touched the battery\'s terminals. He let out a fierce yelp.""Madre de Dios!"" He shook his hand ginerly. ""That wasn\'t the problem.""Adolfo, who had been looking toward the rugged quebradas of the coast range, pointed suddenly. ""Look!""""Look at what?"" the driver replied.""Out there on the pampa."" Adolfo squinted against the morning sun\'s glare. ""I think it\'s a car.""""A car!? Out there!?"" Exasperated, Tito turned to that direction. ""You\'re seeing things. There\'s no way a car could have driven...""Tito let the rest trail off. He had seen it, too. A silvery gleam in the midst of the dwarf sand dunes. Shading his eyes, he added, ""You\'re right. There\'s something out there. What the hell is that!?""""Let\'s find out,"" Adolfo said, slip-sliding down the highway embankment, kicking up a miniature avalanche of pebbles and sand.The two feed dealers hiked across the desert. As they closed in on the spot, the sun dazzle lessned, becoming a shiny gleam on the mirror-like silver surface of a large disc.Excitement had Adolfo\'s heart pounding. ""Caramba! Un disco volante!""It was a flying saucer, all right. What ufologists call ""a daylight disc."" The object rested on a tricycle landing gear. There was no sign of any lights, windows or openings. Later they described the craft as 15 meters (50 feet) long and four meters (13 feet) high. Its surface was so highly polished that their gaze rebounded painfully from the sun\'s reflection.At that moment, to add to their surprise, the craft\'s occupant rounded the front of the saucer. Adolfo described the alien as ""a man of average height, wearing green clothes under a transparent space suit.""Instantly Tito and Adolfo began running towards the saucer. They hurried ""to the place to greet the strange visitor. But as soon as he saw them, he stopped his inspection of the pampa and took off.""""The saucer rose into the air with a shrill metallic whine, a sound familiar to the people who live in the area, which would seem to indicate that the pampa is a landing field for extraterrestrials.""Tito and Adolfo watched as the disc rose into the sky at a nearly vertical angle and disappeared. After it was gone, they returned to the truck. On impulse, Tito put the key in the ignition, pumped the gas pedal and switched on.The truck\'s engine responded without hesitation. The Arequipa radio station came back loud and clear.The Tito Rojas/Adolfo Penafiel case was the first of Peru\'s great UFO flap of the early 1970s. Before it was over, Peruvian ufologists ""counted two hundred and fourteen (214) \'reliable\' sightings in 1973. In more than ninety (90) percent of them, the saucers were piloted by beings who seemed human except for their size and the color of their skin. In eighteen (18) cases, the pilots appeared to be robots.""Sources & References: (See The Mysteries of the Andes by Robert Charroux, Avon Books, New York, N.Y., 1977, page 171.

I was assigned as a Police Helicopter Observer with the Pasadena Police Department and flying night patrol. The pilot was Pat Spafford. In the northeast area of Pasadena, very close to the foothills, we observed what appeared to be a Military Sikorsky helicopter hovering very low over a residential area. The helicopter was turning its landing light off and on. As we got closer, it gained elevation and started heading westbound. Being curious we started to follow it. We were approximately at 1,000 ft. AGL. The military helicopter then appeared to lose altitude quickly as if it was going into auto rotation. Then about 300 meters past it,  we saw what first appeared to be a large object looking like bunch of big balloons tied together. The object was going at our exact airspeed, which was about 60 mph. The object was round and appeared to be rotating. I saw no lights on it. Pat began yelling over the intercom that he was seeing a UFO. I immediately shut off our running lights so I could activate our ""night star"" search light. The running lights were shut off because there would be too many amps going through the system with all the lights on and pop a breaker. Shutting off the running lights to power up the searchlight was S.O.P. (Standard Operating Procedure).Pat questioned what I was doing, and when I told him I was going to ""light it up"", he said, ""No,"" and turned the running lights back on. We had a short argument about doing this or not, but he got the final word because he was the pilot. We watched the object for a few minutes and it flew abeam us going west. We then noticed that there was some fog coming in the L. A. basin, which was a signal for us to fly back to Bracket Field in Pomona, where we hangared the helicopter so as not to get caught in the fog. As we approached the west end of the city near the Rose Bowl, this object gained speed and in just a few seconds accelerated towards the L. A. skyline and disappeared out of sight. The speed it went was faster than supersonic. We were both amazed at how fast it accelerated. We came back to the hangar and immediately started making calls. Pat called LAX to see if they had any such object on their radar. He got a ""negative"" from them. I called JPL in Pasadena to see if they had any kind of experiment going on and they said no.I was taken back by the response I got from them because the person I spoke to sounded like this was an everyday occurrence. We both wrote an incident report and turned it in. I kept this to myself until one day, about 2 weeks later, the Police Chief saw me in the hallway and yelled, ""Hey Al, did you see any more giant Frisbees?""Since that time I have told this story to people but never made a big deal about it. I also never found out if anyone forwarded that report or investigated it further. I left the PD in 1979 to join the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff\'s Dept. Just thought I would tell this story to someone who would enjoy hearing it. Pat Spaffor passed away some time ago,  but I\'m sure there are plenty of people that will remember that story from the old days. I have attached a picture of myself with Pat Spafford taken around the time this happened. This photo was out of the Pasadena Star News on February 13, 1972. ', 'The McChord UFO Incident 1972Source: Bill Hamilton (skywatcher22@hotmail.com)PreambleThis is from the files of AFOSI dated in October 1972. Note that Blue Bookclosed it\'s doors in December 1969 but yet here almost three years later wesee that the Air Force is still collecting UFO reports then proceeding toclassify them. No fictitious names or places were used in this report. Thenames and events are real.On October 14, 1972, Airman First Class(AIC) Steven Briggs and Airman(AMN)Dennis Hillsgeck were instructed to check the tactical air navigational(TACAN) facility located eight miles east of McChord Air Force Base.  TheTACAN site was situated on government land maintained by the United StateArmy, Ft. Lewis.  Briggs and Hillsgeck drove to the TACAN site atapproximately 1300 hours.  Upon their arrival, they opened the locked fencesurrounding the TACAN facility and entered the compound.  Once inside thecompound, they opened the TACAN building and began to conduct a systemscheck of the TACAN equipment.  At approximately 1400 hours., Briggs heard astrange sound outside the building.  According to Briggs, it sounded like ahigh pitch engine.  Briggs exited the building to investigate the sound.Once outside, Briggs observed a saucer shaped object directly above theTACAN building.  Briggs watched as the object landed just south of the TACANcompound.  Briggs was startled by the object and entered the TACAN buildingto summoned Hillsgeck.  Once Hillsgeck and Briggs exited the buildingtogether, they observed two ""creatures"" walking towards the fence.Briggs returned to the building and telephoned (555) the base securitypolice.  He yelled that they needed help at the TACAN site because""intruders"" were attempting to enter the facility.  The phone call wasreceived by Sgt David Holmes, the Law Enforcement Desk Sergeant, 62ndSecurity Police Squadron.  Sgt Holmes dispatched Sgt Dwight Reid and AICMichael Tash to the scene.  It took the security police patrol 17 minutes totravel to the TACAN site.  Upon their arrival, they observed Briggs andHillsgeck standing near their government vehicle.  Both appeared to be in adaze.  Neither could speak.  Sgt Reid summoned an USAF Ambulance to thescene.  Hillsgeck appeared to have been burnt around the face.  AIC Tashwalked around the area and found marks in the soft Washington state dirt.Then suddenly, Sgt Reid yelled to AIC Tash that an object was directly over his head.  A saucer shaped object was hovering just above the TACAN facility.  Sgt Reid attempted to communicate to the security police law enforcement office by using hisMotorola HT-220 portable radio. However the radio did not function.  SgtReid then yelled for AIC Tash to return to the police vehicle.  Sgt Reid andAIC Tash retrieved Briggs and Hillsgeck and drove from the scene.Approximately one mile from the TACAN site, Sgt Reid was able to communicatewith the security police office, requesting assistance and declaring a""Covered Wagon.""  Four additional security policemen arrived on scene,including, Sgt Darren Alexander and his military dog-Champ.  Sgt Alexanderand Champ drove to the scene and started to search the area.  Approximately400 yards south of the TACAN site, Champ alerted.  Sgt Alexander observedtwo ""creatures"" standing near a remote power station.  Sgt Alexander yelledfor the two ""creatures"" to stand and raise their hands.  Both creatures thenmoved towards Sgt Alexander.  Sgt Alexander observed that one of thecreatures was holding an object, which Sgt Alexander thought was a weapon.Sgt Alexander fired six rounds from his military issued Model 15, .38Caliber Revolver.  After firing the shots, Sgt Alexander returned to hisvehicle and radioed Sgt Reid that he had fired at the creatures.  A SecurityAlert Team (similar to a police SWAT) arrived.  They conducted a search ofthe area and observed the saucer shaped object sitting on the ground,directly east of the power station.  They circled the object and called fora supervisor.  Captain Henry Stone, Security Police Law Enforcement, arrivedon scene but the object departed just as Captain Stone walked towards theobject.  The object flew off in an easterly direction and was out of sightin a few seconds.  Office of Special Investigations agents arrived on sceneand conducted an investigation.  Statements were taken from all involved.Evidence was collected from the scene, to include shell casings from therounds fired by Sgt Alexander.This incident was classified as Top Secret and remained in the OSI files asunsolved.']"

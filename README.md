#I Want to Be Believed: Content and Structure as Value Propositions in Ufology Websites

##Introduction
While humans have reported seeing strange objects in the skies for as long as we have been documenting our experiences, the popularity and public fascination with these encounters has ebbed and flowed over the course of history. Since the industrial revolution, the possibility that creatures from other planets may have technologies similar or more advanced than our own has been a recurrent narrative in popular media (Jacobs 1973). Growing out of this fascination, especially after the widely-publicized “Roswell Incident” in 1947,  and in subsequent years, under the shadow of the USSR in the heart of the Cold War, groups dedicated to investigating UFO phenomena have emerged, spending their time and labor in an area that they believe is underrepresented in traditional scholarship (Denzler 2001, Wortman 2004). This project looks particularly at the evolution of these groups since the emergence of the internet, within the context of access to resources and the subjective nature of ‘acceptable’ resources and rhetoric, using documents posted onto Ufology websites.

This project, since it first began in Fall 2016, has been divided into two major sections:
-The first is "Affect+Sentiment," which focuses on the language and subjects present in ~400 first-person stories from people who claim to have experienced an encounter with extraterrestrial visitors or UFOs. These stories were collected from http://ufocasebook.com/.
-The second, more recent, portion of this project is "Structure+Content,"which focuses on the structure of a single Ufology website, Roswell Proof, which has been online since 2000, and collects documents related to the 1947 'Roswell Incident.'

The scripts, raw data, and some images related to each aspect of the larger project are in the appropriate folder. This project was recently presented at the 2017 Keystone DH conference, and a paper on the methods, findings, and relation to information theory is currently being written ;-)

# alienabductions
This project, as a part of Doctoral Seminar LIS 3600: The Digital & The Humanities at the University of Pittsburgh's iSchool, explores the Western fascination with extra terrestrials, UFOs and alien encounters over the past 150 years. Drawing on early and pulp scifi, newspaper articles, government reports, and first-person encounters, this project aims to depict the history of our understanding of what an 'alien' is, and how disparate genres and narrative forms influence our cultural understanding of the ultimate 'Other'.
